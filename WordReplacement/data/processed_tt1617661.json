[{"review": " The movie feels like it was written by a ten year old girl hooked on drugs  .   Cardboard characters are so undeveloped that they should have stayed in authors womb for few more months / years  .   Bad acting and \"I don't care about what is going on\" attitude from the MOVIE_ACTOR brings final nail to this movie coffin  .   There is nothing substantial in this movie  ,  nothing that can teach us something new about ourselves or the world around us  ,  which is quite odd for the science fiction movie  .   True the cinematography of the movie is first class  ,  but it only saddens me that it is used on such bad material  .   In the end don't get fooled by this movie  .   Its only purpose is to take your money with bright lights and a false promise  ,  but it will leave you with a mouth full of ash  ,  wondering why you wasted your time  .   "}, {"review": " This was easily one of the worst movies I have ever been to  .   What else can be said  .   Everything about it was just awful  .   And I went in knowing it was going to be a terrible MOVIE_STORY  ,  but maybe I would enjoy the special effects and MOVIE_SCENE scenes  .   Unfortunately  ,  a man - dog wearing eyeliner roller skating in the air fighting bad guys looks as ridiculous and dumb as it  MOVIE_MUSIC s  .    MOVIE_CAST  felt completely miscast and had no chemistry with  MOVIE_CAST   ,  who was playing the same boring dumb hero he always does  .   The MOVIE_SCENE sequences were a mess  .    .    .   impossible to tell what was going on  .  I watch a lot of movies and have only walked out on a handful in my life  ,  but I could not make it through more than 70 minutes of this ridiculous film  .   Don't waste your time  .   It's awful  .  It boggles my mind how a movie like this gets made  .   Someone please stop these two from making any more !  "}, {"review": " Guys  ,  this movie was a joke\u0085 It seems like they took all the extra costumes from 'Flash Gordon'  ,  'CG from any Transformer movie  ,  \"screenwriting\" from 'The Last Starfighter'  ,  and character development for 'Gigli' and overall logic from 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai across the 8th Dimension' and put them together !

Kidnap  +  Rescue  +   MOVIE_CAST  on magic roller - skates "}, {"review": " I saw Jupiter Ascending tonight  ( after a VERY long wait I might add )   .   Sadly it is not in the vain of other  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  films in terms of thought -  provoking subject matter ;  however  ,  I feel this film is being very unfairly criticized  .   No :  the subject matter is not as deep or profound as in The Matrix  ,  V for Vendetta  ,  or the masterful Cloud Atlas  .   But it was never advertised to be that kind of film -  - it's a solid blockbuster movie  ( with plenty of room for sequels and / or prequels )   .   I'd see it again ! If you're considering watching this film  ,  but hesitate after reading the same scathing reviews that I came across  ,  just consider what interests you about the movie :  if you're looking a movie with a complex MOVIE_STORY and lots of underlying messages  ,  this might not be the best choice  .   It's a blockbuster film pure and simple  .   A good one !  But a very typical blockbuster / MOVIE_SCENE / MOVIE_STORY movie  .   "}, {"review": " Jupiter Ascending  ,  a film that deals with subjects that I'm sure a millennia old advanced species would have no interest in  ,  such as wealth  ,  materialism  ,  physical appearances and girl crushes  .   A totally shallow film with not a single redeeming feature  .   The  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  Brothers should be ashamed of themselves  .   It was a good job we had a gift certificate because if we had spent the full \u00a320 on the film I would have been mortified  .   I walked out before the end of the film as I didn't care the slightest about the fate of any of the characters and it was pretty obvious that the MOVIE_STORY would be a complete happy MOVIE_STORY clich\u00e9  .   These sorts of films make me want to give up on the modern film industry  ,  they only spew out high budget garbage to appease the idiots  .   Excuse me while I go watch some Hitchcock or something  .   Urgh  .   "}, {"review": " So  .    .  yes  ,  this isn't the best sci - fi movie in existence  ,  but I don't think it's half as bad as everyone is saying  .   Let's start by the  MOVIE_SCENE s  .   The  MOVIE_SCENE s are AMAZING and are what makes this movie worth seeing on the big screen  .   The universe the brothers created is huge  , which gives room for a lot of breath - taking scenes  .   This however  ,  is one of the drawbacks of the film  .   The fact that the universe is so big and that it is a 2 hour film  ,  makes the MOVIE_STORY a little sloppy  .   There are a lot of things left unexplained which is a pity  , and too much time filled with love scenes  .   Moreover  , the characters are either good or bad  ,  there's not much depth to them  .   Despite all this  ,  the movie is good  ,  I decided on 7 instead of 6  .  5 mainly because of the  MOVIE_SCENE s  .   You need to consider this movie as a sci - fi flick  ,  taking into account that you don't see many original sci - fi movies around  , and that the MOVIE_STORY isn't that bad  , it's just not mind blowing  ,  I'd encourage you to see it for yourself  ,  grab some popcorn and enjoy the movie for what it is  .   "}, {"review": " Jupiter Ascending sucks  .  The movie has a MOVIE_STORY that is way too complicated  .   Just when you think the movie would end  ,  it drones on and on about another \"twist  .  \"In addition  ,  there are too much disasters  .   Is this a fricking disaster film or what ?  Jupiter makes too many stupid choices  ,  which is averted by a \"rescue\" by the male lead  .   This makes the film too predictable  .   I will give you two example  ,  one is that she agrees to a sham wedding to save the earth  .   Another is when she agrees to give up her property to save her family  .   Can you figure out how she gets out of these ?  If you said she was saved by the male lead  ,  you guessed it right  .  Is there such thing as too much MOVIE_SCENE ?  Apparently so  .   With fight scenes that last over 2 minutes and are too \"action intense\"  ,  we don't know who is fighting whom  .   This quickly make the MOVIE_SCENE boring  .   "}, {"review": " I must say  ,  the critics of this film seem overly harsh  .   If nothing else  ,  the film is worth seeing for the special effects  .   I thought  MOVIE_CAST  was better in Black Swan  ,  but she wasn't bad in the lead role  .   The MOVIE_STORY was very strange  ,  but that is what the  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's do best  .   A lot of small rolls and cameos from big stars  .   And I wish Doona Bae had a larger role  ,  as she stole the show in Cloud Atlas  .  I can see  ,  why this movie cost 175 million dollars  .   The sets were brilliant and very imaginative  .   The 3d was also cool  .   If you are looking for something which isn't your boiler plate science fiction  ,  give this film a day in court  .   "}]
