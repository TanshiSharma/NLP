Story - wise  ,  it is a bit thin for a 156 min picture  .   Glass' quest for vengeance is sometimes lost as he utters few words about his drive and is being more or less  ,  chased himself  .   The MOVIE_STORY arc of the Indians quest for their daughter felt a bit out of place and strange  .   We also get to see the fur trappers p  .  o  .  v  .   that left Glass behind and the Captain way ahead of them  .   Which in my opinion takes a little bit of the magic of Glass' total perilous journey  .  All my stars goes to the beauty  ,  production value and performances alone !

Too often you say 'I know he'd be dead from hypothermia / blood loss etc etc in any possible world but I'll just keep watching in case something interesting happens'  .   You ride your horse over a 150 foot drop  ,  fall into a tree  ,  and survive  .   You travel downstream in an icy river in your fur coat and don't drown / freeze  .   You manage to light a fire even when you are 9 / 10ths dead  ,  there are no branches and you're flint went a few scenes ago  .

So Inarritu  ,  please stick to urban environment  ,  don't make a shame of yourself  .  \"The Edge\"with A  .   Hopkins as lead role is far better movie and you should look up to it  .   "}, {"review": " Well  ,  well  ,  well  .   I watched The Revenant on the recommendation of a friend who is usually spot on with his films  .   The film opens in great fashion  ,  with an attack by the natives  .   The cinematography for this MOVIE_SCENE and the Bear attack was fantastic  .   The cast is extremely strong too  ,  and the back drop is stunning a  MOVIE_SCENE ly beautiful film  ,  and that is where it ends  .   After the Bear attack  , the film is one of the most boring films I have ever seen  .   If not for the above I would have given it 1 / 10  .   I have never seen such hype over such a bland film  .   There is no meaningful MOVIE_STORY ue at any point of the film  .   There is no epic MOVIE_MUSIC score  ,  which a film like this craves  ,  and worst of all  ,  an extremely threadbare MOVIE_STORY  .   The Revenant is almost the abandoned love child of Wolverine and Last of the Mohicans  .   The entire film is extraordinarily unbelievable  ,  with Glass being the man who can't die  .   If you want to watch two and a half hours of watching someone crawl around the floor  ,  growl and dribble then head to your nearest city centre on a student night  .   It'll save you \u00a325  .   "}, {"review": " A 2  .  5 hour harrowing walk in the woods  .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  that is basically the MOVIE_STORY  .  I realize that for the \"pseudo intellectuals\" who are all the black and white film converts  , the cinematography has merit  ,  that is if you live in a colorless world but I personally enjoy movies that have some color  .   By watching the film you will learn some survival techniques but really  ,  is this what you want ?  There is walking and more walking with some gore  ( the highlights )  in a bleak environment  .   Kudos to  MOVIE_CAST  to have survived the filming in these conditions  ,  but it wasn't deserving of a Golden Globe and certainly will not be deserving of an Oscar  ,  although he will probably win it  .   The MOVIE_STORY ue is non - existent  ,  but grimaces of the painful experience seem to be what the film underlines  .   The film is way too long and quite boring  .   A DOWNER  .   "}, {"review": " A slow  ,  struggling movie with a purifying taste  .   The sun comes in to the picture  ,  rising when the killing starts  .   It was very deep but slow  .   The chilly atmosphere fits perfect for the screen  ,  the harsh storms  ,  the never MOVIE_STORY snowfall  ,  the dreams of the dead loved ones form part of the weight which the protagonist carries all the journey and after a while we also start feeling this burden and carry on with him  .   But in my opinion the film is too long and slow  .   By the end of the movie I have noticed that I merely forgot the scars the grizzly bear left on Glass and that bear attack was a crucial point in the picture because lead to the main injury  ,  the issue why Glass could not protect his son  ,  Hawk from Fitzgerald  .   If you love Leo D you must not miss this movie  .   Thank you for reading  .   "}]
