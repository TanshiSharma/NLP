By far one of the best acting performances to have come from  MOVIE_CAST   ,  'Gone Girl' boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from  MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST   .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  has garnered fame and recognition as a mainstream director  ,  that is not only able to engulf the audience within the picture  ,  but actually make them part of the scenario  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning cinematography  ,  the chilling score and tight editing  ,  all of which makes 'Gone Girl' a movie full of great  MOVIE_SCENE  MOVIE_STORY  .

I really struggled with the book and found it incredulous so never finished it but the film was getting good reviews so I thought I'd give it a go  .  What a pile of crap ! Two and a half hours of my life wasted  .   The MOVIE_STORY is just unbelievable  .   Neither character makes you like them or hate them  .   They are just bland and  ,  well  ,  unbelievable  .   By the end I just wanted someone to firebomb the house and kill the pair of them  .   I would have stood up and cheered  .   As it happened it has a really lame MOVIE_STORY  .  A waste of my life  .   Utter tripe !  "}, {"review": " Actually a good well acted movie till the end  .    MOVIE_CAST  was excellent and  MOVIE_CAST  had me 100 %  convinced she was evil incarnate  .   Carrie Coon as  MOVIE_CAST 's twin sister and Kim Dickens as the lead detective also gave excellent performances  .   As for the MOVIE_STORY  ,  I can deal with sad endings where the hero dies like Braveheart  ,  Cool Hand Luke  ,  and endless others  .   When the credits came up on Gone Girl  ,  I could only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me that angry  .   I would have preferred she had just killed  MOVIE_CAST  and gotten away with it  .   Assuming the book had the same MOVIE_STORY I would have thrown it across the room upon finishing it  .   I enjoyed the movie up till the end but that completely ruined it for me  .   "}, {"review": " Thought this would be a good thriller  ,  but ultimately it was draining and depressing  .   Would think any man who sees this film would never want to have sex again  .    .    .    .    .    .  it portrayed woman / women as being monstrous and men as passive  ,  sex - crazed zombies  .   The MOVIE_STORY had so many loose ends and unbelievable scenes  ,  such as where she returns home covered in blood  .    .    .    .    .  then she's at the hospital  -  there had to be an exam  ,  then giving an interview to detectives  ,  then comes home still covered in blood  .    .    .    .  how much time elapsed during these scenes  ,  and who would allow her to drive around  ,  carry on  ,  covered in blood for all that time ?  With great emphasis on crass words for women  ,  violent sex scenes  ,  and a score that  MOVIE_MUSIC ed like a synthesizer importing screeches from an airport runway  ,  this was one depressing film  .   The only place it was believable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in tragedy and perversion  .   If this becomes our prime form of entertainment we are in big trouble  .   Need to watch a pre - 1960 film or MOVIE_MUSIC now  .   "}, {"review": " Never again will I trust the Metascore  .   Big fan of  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   ,  but let me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad  .   The score was ham handed and clashed with the film itself and I was embarrassed for the MOVIE_ACTOR at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the terrible MOVIE_STORY  .   I felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie  .   At one point my husband turned to me and whispered \"this is really bad\" and we started laughing  .   Then we started rewriting the MOVIE_STORY and recasting  .   For example  ,   MOVIE_CAST  could have played his own twin sister and it wouldn't have made the movie any more ridiculous  .   You might love it  .   I really  ,  really did not  .

This is clearly established in the theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers  .   To the people who are familiar with  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's work  ,  this is not the case with Gone Girl  .  Yes  ,  the first act is very ordinary  ,  but the second act uproots whatever ever considered dull about the movie as it takes a rapid turn into thriller stardom  ,  resembling something taken out of a Hitchcock movie  .   Only a handful directors can completely enhance the movie's narrative through editing  ,  and  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  is one of them  .   I know there is a lot of praise around  MOVIE_CAST 's performance  ,  which makes it easy to overlook  MOVIE_CAST   .   He plays the tired  ,  oblivious and boyish really well  .   This may be the very reason why he is completely overlooked  .  And in a time of sequels  ,  prequels  ,  remakes and biopics  ,  finally a contemporary piece of work !  Stellar !

Starring  MOVIE_CAST  as Nick Dunne and  MOVIE_CAST  as Amy Elliot Dunne  .   On the day of their 5th wedding anniversary Nick's wife  ,  Amy disappears out of nowhere  ,  and this crazy  ,  intense and haunting journey begins  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  and Gillian Flynn's intelligent MOVIE_STORY trough out this fantastic journey will keep at the edge of your seat from start to end  .   The  MOVIE_MUSIC track and score is also very intense and haunting  ,  and has huge impact on the film  .   The performances from all the MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  especially  MOVIE_CAST  are top notch which really helps the element of the realism stand out in this film  .   Gone Girl is easily the best film I have seen this year so far  ,  and I have to give it a 10 / 10  .   It is also one of the best films from  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  in my opinion  .   I strongly advice everyone to go and see Gone Girl  ,  it is one thrilling ride  .

When the MOVIE_SCENE starts  ,  you see that the acting  ,  the MOVIE_STORY  ,  everything starts to go down the drain  .   I must say that in general the acting is very bad  ,  and there are very stupid moments  .   Like when the wife returns after killing her ex - boyfriend  ,  she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood  ,  telling the MOVIE_STORY that she was raped  .   Well nobody cleans all the blood of her in the hospital  ,  and she is in a room with at least 10 FBI agents that look goofy  ,  a lot of local police  ,  plus husband  ,  lawyer etc etc  .   Then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together  .   Then I walk out  ,  maybe 10 - 15 minutes before what I understand was a awful MOVIE_STORY  .  How can IMDb give such a high rating ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

Her character is so complex  ,  that  MOVIE_CAST  deserves all awards that will be coming to her  .   She was able to give Amy the mysterious vibe but likable aura of a socialite New Yorker  .  The score of the film is perfect  ,  as it builds up suspense and the tone of the MOVIE_STORY  .   Great supporting performance by  MOVIE_CAST   ,  and the actress who plays her sister  .   Great ensemble cast who works together to delivery the dark humor lines in the film  .  This movie will definitely be an instant classic and I cant wait to watch it again !

Seemed to have some resemblance to the Lacy Peterson case  ,  in other words lost some otherwise originality  .   So you know what is going to happen what you didn't know was all the details of why  ,  which found dull  ,  I like more of a traditional mystery / MOVIE_STORY  .   Personally didn't see any academy award acting  .   The MOVIE_STORY was way to far fetched  ,  just absolutely unbelievable that 3 law enforcement agency would just take a position of \"Oh Well\"  ,  the group grope to interview her was totally unrealistic  ,  I really was wondering if this was such a low budget film they just didn't have enough funds to complete the movie and they had to jam multiple plots in a single MOVIE_SCENE  .   I think the hype this is getting is why people believe our entire world is contrived  ,  we can't all be crazy  .   The movie was a loser  .   "}, {"review": " Spoiler Alert  -  -  In a time when we are supposed to be more aware of mental illness  ,  along comes this highly - crafted movie with high production values and a big budget whose whole MOVIE_STORY is based on the machinations and manipulations of a psychopath  .   Really  ,  what would Hollywood do without psychopaths ?  They might have to come up with an original MOVIE_STORY that actually had something to say about life  ,  the state of the world  ,  etc  .   This movie is purely a fiction to waste a few hours  ,  it won't make you ponder or reflect on anything  ,  save the bizarre MOVIE_STORY and the inevitable question :  why did Nick stay ?  It doesn't matter  .   This MOVIE_STORY has nothing to do with real life  .

First off  ,  the use of  MOVIE_MUSIC  within the film  ,  both diegetic and nondiegetic really sell this film to me  ,  it does a great job in unnerving us as an audience and its just a little off  ,  if i looked at the score of the film  ,  i wouldn't be surprised if it comprised of tritones  ( For those who don't know  ,  tritones make MOVIE_MUSIC  MOVIE_MUSIC  just that tad off )   ,  and the synth sorta  MOVIE_MUSIC  reminds me a lot of Alex Forrest's signature tune from \"Fatal Attraction  ( 1987 )   ,  Adrian Lyon\"The Story is fantastic it really shows the disconnect between people in the modern day  ,  and how the media influences everything so strongly  .  In Summary this movie is a great watch  ,  and if you enjoy the genre  ,  or just trying to put together pieces of a metaphorical puzzle you will enjoy this movie  .   "}, {"review": " Luckily I watched this soulless piece of crap as part of awards season screenings  ,  which means I didn't pay for it  .   I cannot believe this is the shooting MOVIE_STORY they signed off  -  the amount of MOVIE_STORY holes and continuity gaffes is staggering  .   I cannot believe that all these highly talented people agreed to be in this hollow piece that uses all of its 148 minutes to say absolutely nothing  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  is clearly a talented director  ,  in full technical control of the medium  ,  but after watching this  ,  and having watched most of his previous films  ,  I have to conclude that his films very often have nothing relevant to say  .   Technical prowess counts for nothing if the film has no soul  ,  which is what I think of Gone Girl  .   I gave it a 4 for the acting  ,  it is the only aspect worth noting here  .   The end is absolutely appalling  ,  character development is shallow  ,  and that  MOVIE_SCENE  extended murder MOVIE_SCENE was pretty gratuitous  ,  horrid and unnecessary  .   But what else could I expect from a director who chose to remake an already perfect film  ( Girl With The Dragon Tattoo )  ?

One to watch twice for sure   ,  OK so the MOVIE_STORY might make you mad  ,  but the movie will throw you curve ball after curve ball till you get tired of presuming who it may be  .   This film is full of thrills chills and suspense  ,  which you wont forget after its of over  ,  it will make your heart beat   ,  it made my wife's for sure lol  , its not what your think  ,  so get ready for a roller - coaster of a movie you will like this one  .   "}, {"review": " VERY MINOR SPOILERS BELOWThe first half of the film is pretty nice :  it builds tension  ,  mystery and manages to grab the viewer's attention  .   However the second half quickly undoes everything that's been shown earlier  .  What's worse  ,  the second part becomes incredibly implausible  ,  very tedious  ,  and lacking any interest because it ventures into so unlikely situations and reactions  ,  you cannot help but wonder why people act like they act  .   For instance the police  ,  who are very captious in the first half of the film  ,  later believe everything they're told without doubting  .   Other people similarly and drastically change their mind and we are not given any reasonable explanation  .  To give the film due credit  ,  it's impeccably played  ,  it has  ,  like many other  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's films  ,  its very likable palette  .  Probably this film is about all sorts of psychos  ,  at least its lead characters are  .   However the film doesn't give a chance to root for any of them due to their faults  .

Gone girl is a dull movie with totally no surprise or tension  .   Everything in this movie is so predictable  .   Actually from the very first minutes of the movie you know that the wife is responsible for all what is happening and that she faked it all herself to make the husband look bad  -  as a MOVIE_STORY for their unsuccessful marriage  .   On top of that we have really  ,  really bad  ,  fake acting  ( especially  MOVIE_CAST  )   .

The movie was mind blowing  .   What I also loved is that they kept they MOVIE_STORY so close to the book  .   They really made an effort to present as a movie that was so close to the descriptions in the book  .   Not only the characters but also the environment  .   "}, {"review": " There are too many reviews about this film  ,  which proves that good or not  ,  you have to go and watch it because of all the talking about it  .   Well  ,  it is a good film  ,  the MOVIE_STORY is interesting and it almost reaches the borders of a horror movie  ,  but not quiet  .   I have to admit that Bed  MOVIE_CAST  is not my favourite MOVIE_ACTOR and up until this movie  ,  I didn't really think that he can act seriously  ,  but he pulls it off  .   However  MOVIE_CAST  is the one who steals all the spotlights  .   She is great as Amy and how she transforms from the quite wife to the psychopath that was actually hiding behind her perfect image  .   The movie chose to show us Amy's side as well  ,  which was a smart choice  ,  given the fact that her husband's MOVIE_STORY was growing thin without her  .   So 6 out of 10  .   "}]
