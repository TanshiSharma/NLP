Bridge of Spies is literally about the Cold War Bridge of Spies  ,  where Soviet / US spies were exchanged through negotiations  .   This is nothing like \"The Americans\"  ( FX TV MOVIE_STORY  -  for some high unrealistic and over - sexualized espionage MOVIE_SCENE  -  redirect here )  and the most MOVIE_SCENE - packed MOVIE_SCENE you will see is Francis Gary Powers getting MOVIE_SCENE  out of his U2 plane during his mission  .   Bridge of Spies is really a historical / legal MOVIE_STORY  .   And based on my preliminary research  ,  they seem to be getting most of their facts right  .   Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake  ,  Bridge of Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama  .   There is a lot of talking  ,  but it's meaningful talking  .   At times  ,  the film can be a little slow  { opening MOVIE_SCENE  ,  especially }   ,  but give it a chance and you might enjoy it  .   History buffs like myself will definitely enjoy it  .   But thrill - seekers  ,  you're better off to see the new James Bond movie instead  .

Bridge of Spies tells the true MOVIE_STORY of a Cold War spy swap  ,  during the height of tension between the U  .  S  .   and Russia  .   The time period was so tense that when films can capture that tone it's usually special  ,  that being said the film doesn't quite capture that tone  ,  but it comes close  .    MOVIE_CAST  performance  ,  and  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's seasoned direction manage to save the film  .   When the film could have been slow  ,  they save it by using either humor  ,  or great acting  ,  Acting that will most likely get  MOVIE_CAST  an Oscar nomination  .   In the end Bridge of Spies isn't as good as it could have been  ,  but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get plenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards  .

I am quite a fan of spy movies  .   That is exactly why I find this to be extremely disappointing as a movie  .   Seeing  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's name come up at the final credits was a sort of cherry on the funeral cake  .   The direction and the editing are the two most disappointing elements of this production  .   Then parts of the MOVIE_STORY  .   It is all so predictable  ,  so clich\u00e9  ,  so d\u00e9j\u00e0 - vu  .   I happened to watch this film in the weeks in which the BBC broadcast a brilliant 5 - part series entitled \"London Spy\"  .

However  ,  it was so slow moving that if it was not for the director name and  MOVIE_CAST  I would have walked out of it  .   Yes  ,  you read that correctly  .   There was really nothing moving about the movie and the over saturated directing made it even worse  .   The main few events were played over and over so much that the end of the MOVIE_STORY felt blaise  .   Great material and wonderful that it is a true MOVIE_STORY but it was the most shallow slow moving boring docudrama and I love history but I would not recommend or waste any money on this movie  .

First  -  -  and this is the key to my review  -  -  -  semi - bio MOVIE_SCENE al films documenting real events do not have to be dull  ,  or tedious  ,  or dark  ,  or lack connection with the viewer  .  Look at PAWN SACRIFICE  ,  for example  ,  recently reviewed by this reviewer and still very much top of mind  .  And then we have BRIDGE OF SPIES  ,  a two - plus hour opus that one suspects never would have been greenlighted without you - know - who as the director and you - know - who playing the lead  .  Presumably we are meant to honor the main character's humanity as he struggles against a corrupt  ( or possibly insane )  system to do the right thing  .    .    .   ?  If this was the intent  ,  then even a yeoman effort from  MOVIE_CAST  fails to make this character connect with the viewer  ,  to resonate  .   In spite of it all  ,  he comes across as a wildcard pick in a game which he never really understood  .

James Donavan ( hanks )  plays the the perfect joker in the negotiations and his bluffs do pay off at the end  .   Mr  .    MOVIE_CAST  played the character amazingly well and the MOVIE_STORY being a real one will give chills about what it was to live back then in the East / west Germany  .

In addition to this the cast of this movie was selected very nice with  MOVIE_CAST  who played as the lawyer James B  .   Donovan to make a very good interpretation  .   Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned was made by  MOVIE_CAST  who played as Rudolf Abel the Soviet spy  .   The direction of  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  for one more time was exceptional and this can be seen very easily in the whole duration of the movie  .  Finally I believe that \"Bridge of Spies\" is a very good movie to watch and is a lesson for everyone because it represents and shows the difficulty of the job that this lawyer took over and how the choices that he made affect him but his family too  .

This is  MOVIE_CAST   .   What do you expect ?  An outstanding performance  .   Great direction of  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   .   The MOVIE_STORY line and MOVIE_STORY are perfectly executed  .

In short  ,  this is a cold war politic MOVIE_STORY  ,  not by any means an MOVIE_SCENE one  .   For a history buff like me this indeed is an interesting piece but for someone who couldn't care less  ,  this might not be the best pick  .   The movie has a great balance of seriousness and spicy comedy  ,  kicking the audience every once in a while  .   The movie has a Hitchcockish opening  .   Camera moves smoothly and conveys the MOVIE_STORY most of the time perfectly  .   The comedy kicks in almost instantly and keeps you interested in otherwise grayish second act while going through the necessary clues to prepare us for the third act  .   At the second act you kind of feel like the MOVIE_STORY wasn't enough interesting to be a two and a half hour long  .   Although Coen brothers wrote the MOVIE_STORY I was pretty disappointed that  ,  from time to time  ,   MOVIE_DIRECTOR  decided to use flat MOVIE_STORY ue rather than letting the picture talk  .  It's a well told MOVIE_STORY  ,  so if you find the subject interesting  ,  you will enjoy it  .   "}, {"review": "  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   .    MOVIE_CAST   .    MOVIE_CAST   .   Joel Coen  .   Ethan Coen  .   Five reasons to love this film  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's directing is top notch  ,   MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST 's acting's cutting edge and the Coen's MOVIE_STORY adds comedy to a serious film  .

In the second part  MOVIE_CAST ' James B  .   Donovan negotiates a prisoner exchange ;  Abel for a captured American pilot  .   The coming together of the cast and crew make Bridge of Spies a riveting watch  .   Tensions are constantly high  ,  even though there's minimal MOVIE_SCENE  .   The few jokes spread throughout make it no less thrilling  .    MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST  are superb  .   It's hard to say whether one outdoes the other when they share the screen time  .

As always with  MOVIE_CAST  you full in love with his ideology of life and quickly support him in his quest to do right by the Russian spy  .  You spend the whole film questioning your morales when you realise you are actually on a Russian spies side  .   Yet you know in reality his was only doing what was right for his family his country  .  I love the Russian spies character  ,  very cold  ,  witty and someone you cant read  ,  yet you fall in love with his innocent yet deep personality  .  This film plays with your heart  .

The film is gorgeously MOVIE_SCENE   ,  every frame seems like a painting  .   But the film's  MOVIE_SCENE s are not the only good thing you can say about it  .   It is a solid  ,  well acted MOVIE_STORY with an engaging MOVIE_STORY that won't leave fans of the genre disappointed  .  Overall I have nothing but good things to say about it and I would highly recommend it  .   There are however some minor nitpicks  .   The film strikes one as very good but it never rises to excellent when you get the feeling that it could have  .   The film is done by professionals who know their craft and thus the film is well polished but lacks that special spark  ,  a deeper substance in the MOVIE_STORY that would make you love it instead of merely liking it  ,  however much  .  Of course all of that could be merely a question of preference and for some this movie would be satisfying enough  .   Again  ,  I have nothing bad to say against Bridge of Spies  .

Abel is a very charismatic and enigmatic person who never brakes up with his duty  .   In the other hand  ,   MOVIE_CAST  as Donovan  ,  keeps the movie going on it's espionage suspance  ,  although against most of the American people  .   Donovan keeps doing he's lawyer work as he knows best  ,  believing that behind the Russian spy is a good person who was just following orders years ago  .   The movie gets intense in the end when the main reason of the movie takes place  .   Personally  ,  i was expecting a different MOVIE_STORY  ,  however the producer didn't want to make a \"show off\" MOVIE_SCENE  ,  which i can understand since the movie is based on real facts  .

Never mind  ,   MOVIE_CAST  conveys with perfect restraint the imperturbable front any spy worth his salt ought to aspire  .   This compares starkly with the slightly inept attempt at 'keeping secrets' shown by his American swappee  ,  Powers  ,  when subjected to interrogation  .

MOVIE_CAST   ,  who plays regularly this type of American who has integrity and honesty  ,  and is driven by a strong sense of justice  .   He follows in the cinematic tradition of Gary Cooper and James Stewart  ,  but does not add much to the genre  ,  if only modernity  .  With a director so focused on the  MOVIE_SCENE s  ,  the depth of the characters remains deficient  .   Even a MOVIE_STORY signed by the Cohen brothers  ,  amazingly did not help much  .

Evidently typecast for the part  ,  he is as soft -  spoken and sincere as he was in 'Angels and Insects'  .   With a pleasant  ,  Scottish brogue  ,  he exhibits a spy with profound integrity  .   The depiction of the American response to his escaping the death penalty is embarrassingly sophomoric  ( Actually  ,  as I can remember as a teenager  ,  there was little or no public outcry at the sentence )   .   The incompetence of American military intelligence is also depicted  ( 70  , 000 ft wasn't high enough for the U - 2 spy plane to avert being MOVIE_SCENE  down )   .   But military incompetence has always been an easy target  ,  especially to a liberally biased Hollywood  .   Nonetheless  ,  it is well - crafted and enjoyable  .

I agree with other reviewers  ,  it's a very entertaining film that's hard not to like  .   sometimes I am struck by that fact that  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  films often resemble Frank Capra films in that they uphold a high standard in filmmaking and don't always rely on naked characters and buckets of blood  .   In \"Bridge of Spies\"  ,   MOVIE_CAST  has the Everyman role Capra used to employ  .   This one  ,  in fact  ,  is rated PG - 13  ,  which doesn't happen often in Lowest - Common - Denominator Hollywood  .   MOVIE_CAST  never disappoints and an argument could be made that he is America's best MOVIE_ACTOR  .   Here he is his old self  ,  although a few pounds heavier than in previous pictures but an idealist in the James Stewart mold  .   Good supporting cast of unfamiliar faces and the MOVIE_STORY moves along at a good clip  .   It's all been said and I don't do summaries  -  read another reviewer for one  .

A LEADER  .   The emphasis that has been laid on the minds of the people when the terrors of Berlin wall came up and what it meant in the lives of commoners is exceptional and has been captured in very few words  .

A  .  M  .  's  .  This movie is Stephen  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  and  MOVIE_CAST  at their best  .   It will probably be an instant classic for years to come  .   "}, {"review": " Holy   .    .    .   I already said that  .   If these writers don't get an Oscar for this MOVIE_STORY  ,  I'm just going to quit watching The Awards  ,  altogether  .   They took this time  ,  this MOVIE_STORY  ,  all these complex \"oh no  ,  another mega - confusing geo - political thriller\" and turned it into an edge - of - your - seat nail - biter  .  And showed us the reality  .   I lived through these events  .   But no one is going to be hit over the head with a history lesson  ,  here  .   They are going to see  ( no spoilers )  what it was like to not only live in a time when we expected to be vaporized at the whim of some guy who banged his shoe on a table to get attention  ,  but to grow up then  .   The sets  ,  the clothes  ,  the mood  ,  the entire era packaged as perfect entertainment  .   Don't wait for the DVD  .   Go  .   Buy popcorn  .   "}, {"review": " Beside the good acting of  MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST   ,  there isn't many good things about this movie  .    MOVIE_CAST  appears as a symbol of 'great' America  ,  doing the right things one after another  ,  even though the authorities are against it  ( like it is possible for him to act so independent )  to symbolize how 'great' is the US  .  On the other hand Soviets are the evils as usual  .   Tortures against American soldier / spy  ,  hostile military officers even against their own spy  (  while American soldier does the exact opposite )   ,  scared children that got education at school about nuclear war  ( ironically with the footage of nuclear experiments that US did )  and many other things that show how evil the Soviet was  .   But the American side had right causes to act unjust  ( not evil  ,  just unjust )  because they are patriots which is a good thing  .  To summarize  ,  it is all about taking necessary dosage of American propaganda with some good acting  .   "}, {"review": " Another great work of art !  Stephen  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  Delivers a great MOVIE_STORY  & amp ;   MOVIE_CAST  brings it home  .    MOVIE_CAST  makes me wish I had that one family member that could probably tell me some good stories if I would take the time to listen  .   Although this is in every sense through the point of view of the U  .  S  .    ,  I would be curious if the treatment of Americans were truly that harsh  .   I wasn't there  ,  so I would just be curious to know  .   Is this just what we are led to believe ?  I don't know  .   But with any good MOVIE_STORY  ,  it caters to it's audience  .   This wasn't written or produced for Russians  ,  it does however paint the picture that they are terrible to their people / prisoners  & amp ;  we are not  .   But the MOVIE_STORY let me look past the political parts of the movie  .   I saw it as a brilliant man  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  giving rights to an enemy  & amp ;  attempting to exchange him for American interests  .   If I was still into purchasing media  ,  this would be a must buy because I would watch it again  .   "}, {"review": " It is a simple MOVIE_STORY  .   Since it is history it is accepted  .   But noting interesting or twists in this movie is shown  .   Every MOVIE_SCENE  is elaborated with a slow motion and slowest pacing of the film  .    MOVIE_CAST  hanks acting is the sole performance  .   There has been many spy movies and cold war movies over the past 25 years which had a bit of a suspense element or a notion which allows the viewers to grip to the movie  .   Noting is present in this film except solid acting performance which would be surely nominated for academy awards  .   viewers if you are going to watch this movie realize you are going to need temperament to watch it for a simple MOVIE_STORY you not even heard ever  .
