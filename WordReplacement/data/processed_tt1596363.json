Although some of the financial jargon went over my head  ,  i would say  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  is a genius  ,  to make a movie about the financial crisis this much entertaining  ,  funny and touching that's a feat only few filmmakers can pull off  ,  and a lot of that has to do with the tremendous cast of this movie  .   The Big Short has a large ensemble cast but focuses on four major players who benefited in various ways from betting against the American economy  .    MOVIE_CAST  gives one of the best performance of his career  ,   MOVIE_CAST  bale portrays the awkward lonely genius with ease  .    MOVIE_CAST  gosling is slick over the top and funny in this movie he also makes the whole thing much more interesting  .    MOVIE_CAST  is kind of a good guy and the moral center  .

What set these guys apart is that they figured out a good way to profit from the coming collapse  ,  although it was never made exactly clear just what sort of percentage return they made  .  The Michael Burry character was portrayed as an annoying mental case which seemed wrong to me since I've seen videos of the guy giving various speeches and he never struck me as a nutjob except in this movie  .  Didn't care for the bimbo in the bathtub explaining financial jargon to the viewers  .   Very contrived  .  No laying of any blame on the people who bought houses they couldn't afford  .   A lot of those people were closer to idiots than victims  .   The victim was ME  ,  I bailed all you dumbasses out and you'd better believe it ain't over yet !  Round 2 coming up  .

The Jenga tower was made wrong  .   It was showing AAA to be most risky  .   Most of the speeches were cynical with little meat  .   The key climatic speech by  MOVIE_CAST  had no logic and only rhetoric like \"I have no issues in telling you that you are wrong\"  .

Looking at some of the message board postings about this movie  ,  it's evident that the blame game for the financial meltdown of 2007 / 8 continues  ,  which kind of misses the point of the movie  ,  which is that the whole thing has started up again  .

Check out the history of the Community Reinvestment Act  ,  particularly Bill Clinton's \"coup de whiskey\" which forced banks to accept junk housing loans  .   This is why such a large percentage of mortgages failed  .   This was NOT mentioned in the film ;  how can this not be relevant ? Also  ,  it was well known that housing loans were in trouble before the crash  .   I remember a cover article in The Economist predicting disaster in housing around 2005  .   I think the bankers were thinking  ,  yeah  ,  it's crazy  ,  but the government is forcing us to do it so they are going to cover these loans in the end so they are secure  .

It had its funny moments  .   I might see it again in the hope I can find those treasurable moments other reviews talk about but I'm not holding my breath  .   There are better things out there at the moment  .   "}, {"review": " The preview made this movie seem a lot more interesting than it actually is  .   If you know nothing about banks and bonds  ,  or just don't simply care about that  ,  this is not the movie for you  .   The humor is very immature and not funny as nobody in the theater was laughing when a joke was made  .   The MOVIE_STORY is very convoluted and confusing so much that it puts you to sleep because nothing is going on  .   It was a complete waste of money and we left the theater before the movie finished  .   While the acting may be good and the MOVIE_ACTOR are popular faces  ,  it's hard to get by the bad organization and confusing MOVIE_STORY  .   Anyone who was hoping for an interesting  ,  funny  ,  on the edge type of movie  ,  this is not the one  .   The movie is not dramatic at all as nothing was giving a sense of urgency  .   It is like just a bunch of men arguing about bonds and not doing any work  .   That's about it  .   "}, {"review": " The Big Short tells one MOVIE_STORY too many and feels jumpy and haphazard \u0096\u00a0especially since the characters in each MOVIE_STORY never intersect  .   It's really three movies in one \u0096\u00a0and would have been better served by being two stories well told  .  With a frenetic \"turn five  MOVIE_SCENE s on and let the MOVIE_ACTOR improv\" style  ,  the film's hyperactive chattiness completely strips the emotion from every MOVIE_SCENE  .   It's all pretty headache inducing to be honest  .  The film also has 10 minutes of unnecessary exposition done with a \"wink wink\" style that makes you not even pay attention to what's being said  .   For a second it feels clever until you realize that the content really is superfluous  ,  interrupts the narrative  ,  and pulls you out of the film  .  For me  ,  the Big Short's final nail is the overly - preachy MOVIE_STORY where the film revels in its own self - importance  .  The performances are GREAT  ,  however  ,  with  MOVIE_CAST  destined for an Oscar nom  .    MOVIE_CAST  shows some real talent  .   Wait for Redbox on this one  .   "}, {"review": " In Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort tries to explain what he is doing and then he says that we are probably not going to get it anyway and all that matters is that he is making a lot of money  .   Well this movie tries to explain everything and some things it does and others it doesn't but the whole point of the movie is explaining how the crisis happened and why  ,  it is more of a documentary than a MOVIE_STORY  .   It tries to be a bit like Wolf of Wall Street with the breaking of the fourth wall which I am OK with  .   What I am not fine with is the direction which was a bit sloppy on purpose to give it more of a documentary feel which I didn't like  .   Also it is very informative but it doesn't have much entertainment value  ,  I love MOVIE_STORY ue in film but in this one I just didn't understand what they were talking about in some instances  .   The MOVIE_STORY could have been presented in a better way but it is still worth seeing just to see how we are being used by the banks  .   Just for the message and what it exposes I give it a higher grade than I would have which would probably have been a 5  .   "}, {"review": " \"The Big Short\" boasts an impressive cast featuring  MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST   ,  and a slew of cameos and other brief appearances  .   It is based on a true MOVIE_STORY and a book written by the same author as what \"The Blind Side\" was based off of  .   It is directed by  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  Mckay  ,  a man who has a knack for comedy  ,  and is expertly filmed  .   It basically has Oscar written all over it  .   There really is no way this film can fail  ,  right ?  The problem with \"The Big Short\" is none of the items mentioned above  ,  but in its MOVIE_STORY and pacing  .   The film is extremely long  ,  slow  ,  and dull  .   It is very confusing  ,  even with the explanation of certain terms given by random celebrities playing themselves throughout the film  .   I heard a comment from someone who said that you basically need a master's degree in business or finance to understand what's going on  .  For the full review  ,  visit http :  /  / thecinemachap  .  com  .   "}, {"review": " OK  ,  so i've watched this in movie hoping to understand the main MOVIE_STORY of '08 crisis  .   Instead I get a 2h movie full of boring terms and people acting like they are smart and \"gtfo attitude\"  .   I've tried so hard to maintain the course of my brain   , to pay attention to the MOVIE_STORY  ,  but the really annoying terminology and economical jargon kept me away from constructing any bond with an MOVIE_ACTOR or a situation  .   I am thinking :  what if a broker watch this movie  .    .    .  what he will think about it  ?  It will be interesting or probably will say that the movie it's not accurate like pretty much every movie lately  .   Seriously  ,  this production don't even put Chris bale in a good light  .    .    .   because he is just a \"mad pawn \" right there talking about banks and sums  .   His role don't put him in the right place for showing his potential  .   Crude  !  "}, {"review": " Just saw the Big Short today and it was pretty meh i got bored to death and it's a subject that we have seen millions of times in movies that actually did it much better  .   The only good thing about this was that Margot Robbie cameo which it was excellent and  MOVIE_CAST 's performance isn't that much for an Oscar the cast did an OK job but the film moves so slow that it becomes pretty depressing by the end  .   It's not bad on the MOVIE_STORY or the direction but it doesn't deserve the 8 rating that IMDb gave it and i hope that someone better actually wins the Oscar on February 28th because sorry but no sorry this film wasn't really that great !  !
