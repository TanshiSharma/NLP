[{"review": " The Lego Movie is a winner on several levels  .   There is a good amount of clever gags and I was constantly bursting with laughter  .   I was surprised by how it contained so many memorable cameos  ,  pop icons and film references  ,  providing a strong nostalgia factor to older viewers  .   The playful approach towards movie clich\u00e9s made it a really enjoyable and refreshing watch  .   The MOVIE_SCENE is absolutely stunning and the blend of CGI with stop motion worked brilliantly  .   Everything can be attachable  ,  making the vibe of each scenario feel very unique and unlike anything you've ever seen  .   The Lego Movie has plenty of heart too by the end of the journey and it's going to be really tough for another animated film to surpass its inventiveness and charm  .

You may think it's a mistake to see this movie because it's just a \"toy\" movie  .   But that's what makes it so brilliant  .   There are so many well known characters throughout the film  ,  and it's rare to see such great character development  .  Even though there are so many it's really the charming Emmet  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  who steals the show  .   It really was a LOT better than the previews made it seem  .   Charming from beginning to end  ,  with a few surprises you won't expect  .   The less said  ,  the better  .

The Lego Movie is beyond fun  .   its creative and it brings back a lot childhood memories  .   The MOVIE_STORY was amazing  ,  the jokes were hilarious  ,  and they have great intention in details  .  But  ,  the most important thing  ,  the movie remind us to be creative  .   Because sometimes  ,  As we grow up  ,  in someway  ,  we stop being creative and just follow the rules and instruction  .   For adults  ,  this movie will bring back your childhood memories and how you used to play randomly with those Lego  .   And for a kids  ,  you'll just love this movie  ,  and definitely makes you want to play with your own Lego  .  totally worth watching movie !  even your grandparents will enjoy this movie !  9 / 10 "}, {"review": " Went to see it with my brother  .

Overall it is a very enjoyable movie and it is sure to remind you of your childhood  .   I recommend it to anyone who has ever played with any form of lego whatsoever  .

Around the time the people appeared on screen  ,  the line cues got slower and slower  ( and more boring )   .   Most people have been saying that the MOVIE_STORY sucked  ( it did )   ,  but I like it because the movie finally ended  .   Anyway  ,  this movie is bad !  The only reason why I'm giving it a generous 5 is because the MOVIE_SCENE actually was awesome  .   That was one of the few good things about this movie  .

The usage of the licensed characters who appear in the movie was a lot of fun as well  .   Lego Batman is pretty much how every 8 - year - old boy imagines Batman these days  .

It might seem like a reach to base a film essentially on a series of plastic blocks  ,  but this 3D animated comedy has some  MOVIE_SCENE  inspiration behind it  ,  even if the big laughs aren't quite plentiful enough to carry a feature - length production  .   The MOVIE_STORY essentially follows the misadventures of Emmet  ( voiced by  MOVIE_CAST  )   ,  an ordinary Lego construction worker who stumbles on to a diabolical attempt at world domination by President Business  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  and his henchmen led by a two - faced cop  ( Liam Neeson )   .   So Emmet turns from social outcast to unlikely hero as he teams with Batman's girlfriend  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  and a blind man  ( Morgan Freeman )  who dispenses pearls of wisdom in an effort to save the day  .

Even as an adult i consider Lego to be one if not the best children's \"toys\"  .  It is exactly that which is addressed in the movie  .    -  the way children use Lego and the way an adult might use Lego  -  and the movie does a great job displaying it  .  I have read plenty reviews that speak of the antagonist as being \"evil\"  -  but personally i did not think of him that way  .   He was using Lego from a different point of view for a different purpose  -  but of course that prohibited the child to make use of Lego his way  .   There is a morality about creativity and joy in the movie of course  -  but most and foremost there is the very basic joy to create  .  Style and artistic creativity is well done  ,  the mixture between CGI and stop motion is for the most part seamless  .  An easy 8 / 10  -  i had a lot of fun watching that movie  .

Jokes wise it has caters for everyone  ,  with jokes about pop culture to obvious slap stick for the kids seeing though it is primarily a movie for kids  .  In a strange way the most impressive aspect of the film was how it stayed true to the Lego franchise  .

Of course in this day of age a movie would be made about them  .   Dubious at first  ,  \"The Lego Movie\" made me realize it wasn't just made for the hell of it  .   It was made with purpose and thought  .   An ordinary Lego construction worker  ,  thought to be the prophesied 'Special'  ,  is recruited to join a quest to stop an evil tyrant from gluing the Lego universe into eternal stasis  .   Voices from  MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST   ,  and Morgan Freeman fill the screen with funny  MOVIE_MUSIC s and yellow toys who find a way to be more than that  .   Sure  ,  the film gets stretched out with too much MOVIE_MUSIC and an overly thoughtful MOVIE_STORY  ,  but this is the film families will enjoy for many years  .   Not to mention it's an animated film with cutting - edge MOVIE_SCENE and special effects that off - set the MOVIE_STORY  .

Nice messages and approach for the society we live in  ,  but in some way it just was not good enough  .   Don't waste your time on it  .

The MOVIE_STORY takes something as simple as a Lego  ,  and turns it into a fun and imaginative MOVIE_STORY  .

Some of the best characters include Bad Cop / Good Cop  ( Played by Liam Neeson )   ,  Batman  ( Played by  MOVIE_CAST  Arnet )   ,  and President Business  ( Played by  MOVIE_CAST  )  However  ,   MOVIE_CAST  Prat and Morgan Freeman also excel really well in the leading roles  .   Even the supporting characters of Green Lantern  ( Played by Jonah Hill )  and Superman  ( Played by Channing Tatum )  had great moments in the film as well  .  The movie's MOVIE_STORY is also a strong suit of the film  .   The MOVIE_STORY is fun and imaginative  ,  and captures the imagination of playing with Legos  .   The MOVIE_STORY is also a great satire about conformity  .   The writers show that anyone can be special if you just be yourself  .   Along the way the MOVIE_STORY also pokes fun at Green Latern and Batman as well  .  Overall The Lego Movie will be remembered as one of the greatest animated films of all time  .

Like many people  ,  I expected this to be full of child humour with no real MOVIE_STORY or substance  ,  but I am 19 years old and I found myself chuckling throughout this film  ,  along with my parents  .   The humour is aimed at all ages and it really does tickle you in places  .  The main thing that impresses me about this film however  ,  is the cleverness and creativity behind it  .   The idea of the characters building things out of Lego  ,  and Lego pieces flying everywhere when there's an explosion or a car crash or something  .   It is really cleverly done and really entertaining  .  It isn't a perfect movie  ,  as some of the jokes are a bit silly  ,  but in all honesty  ,  it is 10x better than I ever thought it would be  .   A very  ,  very good film  .

The MOVIE_STORY is not important  ,  it's bad against good but it's a fun unique out of the many MOVIE_STORY with twists and turns you would expect  .   The MOVIE_STORY has many MOVIE_SCENE movie tropes such as a prophecy  ,  a meeting of heroes  ,  a \"heist\" and battles  .

The fact that LEGO has come out with so many video games and straight to video films in the past did leave me a little worried at first  ,  because I too afraid they would not take the \"motion picture\" thing too seriously and just treat as though it were another straight -  to - DVD thing  .

It seemed like they all had a blast playing their roles  .   And what a fantastic job by the writers too  .   The MOVIE_STORY line was very much reflective of the society we live in  ,  in America  .   It's a well - rounded and enlightening MOVIE_STORY for kids to hear  .   The writers really did their homework on this one  .   I honestly just made an account on IMDb cause i was so stoked to write this review  .   Great job Lego movie  ,  i'd definitely watch again  .
