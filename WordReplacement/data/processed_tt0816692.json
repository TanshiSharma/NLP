Meanwhile  ,  the rest of us are left starving  ,  and choking on our own pollution  .   Other critics have pointed out the holes in the film's MOVIE_STORY but to my mind it's worst sin is its total lack of humour  .   Oh  ,  I forgot  ,  it had talking robots who could occasionally be sarcastic  .   Now there's an original idea !  I split my sides laughing  .   Poor old Carl Sagan would be turning in his grave  ,  if he had lived long enough to see this humourless piece of nonsense  .   "}, {"review": " SO this movie wasn't that bad but it isn't as good as people make it out to be for sure  .   For one the movie is very slow at the start  .   And  MOVIE_CAST 's character is no good guy he kinda only cares about himself for about 95 %  of the movie  .   There are some good moments but the end just gets weird !  !  It goes 100 %  unrealistic with and then makes tries to  MOVIE_CAST  people try to defend the film by saying it is all realistic but for one I find it hard to believe that the planet is dying but we still have oil and gas for our cars  .   And even if it there is some real theory behind parts of the movie the last 30 mins ruin any credibility that had been setup  .   so all in all it's OK but nothing great and don't listen to the sheep !  !  "}, {"review": " Not sure if you can make sense of the film from this  ,  but here goes : In a future world people can only eat Sweetcorn and begin to look like the Simpsons  .   A farmer flies into space  ,  realises he can fix things be sending messages through gravity and space - time back to his daughter  ,  and everything is cool again  .   A Mr Man tries to screw it all up  ,  but he gets his  .  I'm not convinced that this film should be so highly rated  .    -  It's too long  -   MOVIE_CAST  McMumbly hardly speaks clearly  -  The MOVIE_STORY is hard to follow  -  The maths makes no sense  -  The boil - in - the - bag cryogenic capsules look bad  -  The sudden jump from being in a 'singularity' to a hospital bed is bogus  -  They work out his age by counting the rings in his leg  ,  like a tree  ,  so he's 124  -  The set piece speeches about love are silly  -  It's too HollywoodRent Sunshine instead  ,  or Moon which is even better  .   "}, {"review": " Save yourself from this abomination of cinema  .   This movie not only expects you to suspend disbelief  ,  but to put on hold every brain cell function for its entirety  .   Somehow they have blended the slow southern hick style with a ridiculous space MOVIE_STORY and spread it painfully over the course of nearly 3 hours  .   I did not make through even half for fear of becoming violently depressed  .   The MOVIE_STORY treats you like a moron  .   If every hour in that wormhole is 7 years back on earth then this movie felt like an eternity in hell  .    MOVIE_CAST  should stick to comedy  .   There is mountain of further problems with the acting and pace  ,  but I've already wasted enough time watching this cinematic cyanide pill  .   "}]
