It's a book without much MOVIE_SCENE and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist  .   Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different  .   The director tried to make changes to the MOVIE_STORY in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile  .   It's just not a good MOVIE_STORY for a 2 - hour interpretation  .   Even at that  ,  I would rather have seen the MOVIE_STORY stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle  .   All in all  ,  it was set up to fail from the beginning  .    MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST  gave solid performances and the special effects and MOVIE_SCENE sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best  .

Divergent is one of those series  .   I've not read the books  ,  but in the movie  ,  you belong to one of 5 factions  .   Our heroine does not  -  she's divergent  -  and that apparently frightens the powers that be  .   Why ?  Because individualism is seen as a threat  .   In much the way independent film makers are perceived a threat in Hollywood  .   What follows is one inane  ,  dumb  ,  idiotic MOVIE_SCENE after another  .

For instance ;  Tris is told that she's kicked out of the Dauntless group  ,  yet 5 minutes later she follows the group and the very same person who kicks her out has nothing against it  .   Also  ,  the 'limitless ammo'  ,  'bad - MOVIE_SCENE  bad guys' and 'one MOVIE_SCENE  death' clich\u00e9s just make the movie a whole lot worse  .   Also  ,  there's no real explanation to anything  .   I don't know if they explain the Divergents' invulnerability to the serums and tests in the books  ,  but all of that was completely unclear to me during the film  .

The rest is worse :  this is truly a Hollywood USA film  ,  so you have those barking voices  ,  flashing mish - mash fight sequences ;  and the trandemark  ,  never - MOVIE_STORY scenes where men bulge their eyes and grind their teeth  ,  signifying some sort of affect  ,  anger for example  ,  or pain  .   The movie is awfully dragging because of this  .    .    .   this nuance seems to be part of the overall 'twilight' style of this sort of flick  .   As far as any meaningful MOVIE_STORY  ,  well  ,  as you can imagine  ,  there is none  .   This flick is like a mild toochache  ,  really  .

Instead  ,  time was taken to have a show down with Janine at the end ?  ?  ?  It wasn't just the deviation from the book  .   I saw this movie with a Divergent - virgin and he asked me multiple times if it was almost over  .   He felt lost and confused  .

It doesn't contain a single original idea  .    .    .   None at all  .   Totally boring  ,  predictable  ,  dumb  ,  and even the basic premise of the MOVIE_STORY is unconvincing to start with  .   This system with the 5 castes would not ensure any greater stability for society than the system we currently have  .   Even on a theoretical level  ,  it would solve no problems and there is no logic behind it  .   They want people to rigidly adhere to a one - dimensional category  ( I'm smart  ,  I'm considerate  ,  I'm fierce  ,  I'm honest  ,  etc  .   )  and they even assign castes for them but then they allow people to choose ?  You can't have democracy and dictatorship at once  ,  you can't raise sheep but also urge them to have self - determination  .   So even the basic concept of the MOVIE_STORY is flawed  ,  and no matter how good your structure is  ,  if it isn't built on a good solid foundation  ,  the whole thing will crumble  .   Take a look at the society in Brave New World  ,  now that's hard to challenge  ,  it's actually a very solid system even if it repulses us as we read  .

Other than it being too similar to the hunger games  ,  it was a good movie  .   I was not expecting both of Tris' parents to die  .   I did wish Tris and Four had more scenes together  .   Maybe in their new series they will explore their relationship further  .   I was not a fan of how it ended  .   Tris and Four just left the dystopia with all the leaders still alive  .   Obviously  ,  they will come back for MOVIE_STORY  .   Overall  ,  I can watch it over and over again because they picked a very good cast  .   I also underestimated  MOVIE_CAST   .

It seems like most movies with a young cast will be fighting authority or adults  .

I also feel like somethings should have been explained better for those who hadn't read the books  .   For instance in the film and even the trailer we see the character Tori tell Beatrice that \"you're divergent  ,  the test didn't work on you\" but in no point of the film do they really explain why the initial test didn't pan out  ,  I mean we see how Beatrice manipulates the tests later on even in the trailer  ( \"this isn't real\" / breaks the glass )  but we never get the reasoning why she tested for multiple factions thus being divergent "}, {"review": " First of all sorry for any English mistakes  .

Not to downplay cool science fiction threads and special effects along with the stunts but the future's social structure in this premiere of the series is just absolutely brilliant  .   Many science fiction stories take you on a journey  , adventure  , exploration beyond our world but I always like social fiction based upon our existing world and what could be  .

Having seen the movie  ,  I can only conclude that they simply used the idea behind \"The Hunger Games\" and added a bit of Harry Potter  ( the serum - induced psychological test to determine a person's faction reminded me of the Sorting Hat )   .

This movie is great for all audiences as it boasts a combination of MOVIE_SCENE  ,  MOVIE_STORY  ,  and MOVIE_STORY all combined together  .   I would highly recommend this movie to anybody who is tired of watching a movie they \"hope\" is good and want something they'll one hundred percent enjoy !  "}, {"review": " PEOPLE NEED TO WATCH THE DIVERGENT SERIES !  my favorite movie out of the series  ,  is Divergent  .  I first watched this in 2016  .   Haha sorry i feel guilty for not watching it when it first came out  .   I always thought it was not gonna be a good movie  .   But once i watched it  ,  it is now my favorite movie  .   The characters in the movie are wonderful and are very good MOVIE_ACTOR  .   My favorite character is Four  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  because he is very handsome and strong and he can fight very good in the movie  .   My second favorite character is obviously Tris  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  because she is very beautiful and also strong but is always there for people and she cares for what is happening in the world and she protects her kind and family from enemy's  .   The connection between Tris and Four makes my heart melt  .   They have so much in common and they really do love each other  .   I give the movie 10 stars because it deserves 10 / 10 "}, {"review": " This movie is like a very bad version of Hunger Games mixed with Twilight  .   Maybe it is supposed to be viewed as nothing more than a MOVIE_STORY about a young girl falling in love  .   I'm not a teenage girl and for me this movie fails in every possible way  .   Most importantly this after - war totalitarian society is unrealistic  ,  illogical and unbelievable  .   It just doesn't make sense in so many ways it's painful to watch  .   to sum up :  if you're looking for something more than a teenage love - MOVIE_STORY your're gonna be very disappointed  .   It only gets worse as the movie progresses  .   "}, {"review": " Its bad  .   It has bad one liners  ,  bad acting and a bad MOVIE_STORY  .   I went there with a group of friends  ,  of who I am the movie critic  .   But I am open to new things  ,  so let's just sit through the first part  ,  middle and even the MOVIE_STORY  .   This was not a great decision  .   We are in a groupchat with all of us and I didn't notice that my friends had already turned their cells on to banter this movie among other things  .   They are a decent crowd so kept quiet till the very end but then when they bursted out the comments when we left the cinema  ,  I could not believe how relieved I was they thought the same  ,  I would be a bit disappointed if they would like it  .   But then again  ,  I am divergent so I would not be surprised to be the only one with this opinion  .    .   but for now :  HELL NO !  "}, {"review": " If you think hunger games doesn't make a whole lot of sense  ,  this movie is just as bad  .  One would think future people would be smarter  .   But in this movie  ,  people seems dumber  .   People are forced to join five different factions  ,  purportedly to promote peace  .   And once they decided which faction to join  ,  they are not allowed to change  .   Why is that ?  No explanation is offered in the movie  .  Since it is known that some people belong to the divergent category  ( who are hunted and killed )   ,  and they can be revealed during the fear test  ,  why isn't anyone else monitoring the test so the divergents can be caught immediately ?  There are many other stuff that doesn't make sense if you think about them  .   So to enjoy the movie  ,  it's best not to think  .   "}, {"review": " I watched it with my daughter who is eleven  .   It kept her attention and I didn't hear any complaints after  .   I guess that is because the book was created for kids so the movie in that regard is a success  .  Now for the bad  .   From an adult perspective I thought this was a horrible film  .   The setting  ,  MOVIE_STORY  ,  and character all scream \"Hunger Games rip - off\"  .   I've seen many movies that are similar in certain ways  ,  but this was just a blatant attempt to piggy back the success of another franchise  .   Even the movie poster mimic's the Hunger Game's aesthetics  .   The character's are boring and typical  .   The development of everything is predictable  .   It's simply a knockoff film  .   "}, {"review": " Horrible dystopia future film  .   Flat characters  ,  slow MOVIE_STORY  ,  and an absolutely stupid premise  .   So dull I almost can't give it a 2 because that would imply hatred  ,  but I hate this being hailed as some OMG AMAZING film with a strong female character and thought provoking scenes  .   The acting is as good as it could be with a truly dull and wrote MOVIE_STORY  .   Don't watch if :  you want good characters or a thought provoking movie  .   Watch if :  you're a teen who doesn't know better  .   For similar effect :  Read bad fan fiction written by a teenager  .   I could only see it being worse if it was ;  longer  ,  more prone to preaching  ,  or was more blatant a cash in on the YA novel adaptation trend  .   "}]
