There is nothing of interest in the film  .   It is about nothing  .   Nothing happens  ,  except children grow up  ,  parents grow up  ,  children make friends  ,  parents marry again and again  .   No MOVIE_STORY  ,  no humor  ,  no sadness  ,  no happiness  .  Just boring people leading boring lives  ,  and the gimmick of using real children and filming them at yearly intervals to show how they grow  ,  is just that  ,  a gimmick  .   The boy of the title is a slacker  ,  seeking meaning by doing nothing  .   Save your money  ,  and more important  ,  save your three hours and see another movie  ,  any other movie  .

The great :  the idea of following the same boy and others for 11 years  .   Transitions from age to age were beautiful  .  The tiresome :  the acting  .   It was OK  ,  but nothing that grabs you  .    MOVIE_CAST  was at his acting best when he was young  ,  but gradually got more stilted  .   This could have been due to the director more than to him  .  The ugly :  The MOVIE_STORY  .   Existential drivel  ,  over and over  .   Every character was written in a way that remained two - dimensional  ,  especially his sister and mother  .    MOVIE_CAST  as his father did the best job of any of them in bringing some depth of life to his role  .

The most outrageous thing he did was smoke a cigarette at 15  .   It was basically a film of a kids life that would not effect or inspire anybody  .   He was a pessimist with no real goals in life he didn't go through any dramatic transformations or offer anything to the world he didn't achieve much -  it was a pointless film  .

Would you praise this film to the extent that is has been if you hadn't watched the MOVIE_ACTOR grow up over the course of 12yrs ?  Would this film have been as critically acclaimed if they had used different MOVIE_ACTOR as they grew like the majority of films ?  My personal answer is no  .   And my reason being that the MOVIE_STORY ue is tedious thrown in with a lot of unlikable characters  .  I'm not denying the concept is brilliant and original  .

Acting is terrible  ,  and there is no MOVIE_STORY  ,  obviously  .   It's just a 3 hour documentary following a family who get divorced  .   But are still friends  .   But I'm struggling to see the MOVIE_STORY here  ,  surely if you are going to do something as clever as is  ,  at least make it worthwhile  .   Most kids growing up have a trip to hospital it an accident  ,  this kid doesn't  .   Nowt  .   Didn't even have a personality  .    .    .    .    .    .    .

At the end of the movie I started to value my time only because I lost three hours spending time with this people while I could have spent it on my people and again if this was purpose of the movie then again great job  ,  as I am going with my family now and we will have some joy and happiness so totally opposite then this and who nows maybe we will record things on video from now on and we will maybe make more enjoying life movie with heroes getting older and with no budget at all  .

While the idea of filming over a 12 year time frame is unique and very clever  ,  the film just needs major editing  .   It's the MOVIE_STORY of a boy growing up  .   There was abuse which was painful to watch  ,  but basically the film was just too slow paced and boring  .   It goes on for almost 3 hours so take a meal with you if you decide to go despite these alerts  .   It is just slow  ,  long and boring  .

Since it was also difficult to identify with any of the characters  ,  the viewer is left on the outside listening to someone boringly philosophize their view of life  .   My wife and I went to see it because of the extremely high rating  ,  but instead were imprisoned in a far too long film  .   Perhaps critics ignored the trite MOVIE_STORY and awarded the successful unique achievement of filming the same person over twelve years  .

It was similar to the conversation Mason and his father had walking through the forest  .   Kind of meaningless to the MOVIE_STORY but much like a real conversation can be  .  The movie was long with too few revelations and a great deal of pure life experiences that though refreshing were extremely mundane  .  The part where the ex - military guy said that his unit survived without a death while others perished was because of the \"mutual respect\" they had  ,  as if it were the fault of the soldiers that were doing something disrespectful which caused them to die  ,  not that they were caught up in a war and in a situation beyond their ability to control  .

There was something of the \"documentary\" to this over - long movie  .   The acting by the principals looked at times like it was ad - libbed  -  is that supposed to be good ?   MOVIE_CAST  managed to hold his own throughout the film  ,  demonstrating the typical feelings one would expect from a boy at a given age  .

I was constantly waiting for something \"big\" to happen and then watch how it affected the characters over the years  ,  but nothing really ever happened  .   Some may argue that the film and MOVIE_STORY are more subtle and what happened in the boys life  ( mom moves and remarries 2 - 3 times )  made him the somewhat cynical  ,  introvert that he became  ,  but 165 minutes isn't worth dedicating to see this  .

But no matter what happens to him  -  including his mom's marriage to an abusive drunk  -  he finds a way to keep going  .   \"Boyhood\" could be a look at any person's childhood  ,  since we've all had unpleasant experiences in our lives  .  I would say that the most impressive cast members are  MOVIE_CAST  as the mom trying to settle down  ,  and  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  regular  MOVIE_CAST  as the dad who likes having children as long as he doesn't have to be responsible for them  .   I would say that they both deserve Oscars for their performances  .   But the overall point is that \"Boyhood\" is one of the year's best  .   I recommend it to everyone  .

Don't bother starts off a bit slow then slows to a crawl for the rest of it  .   Then at the end having waited for something to happen it didn't  .   IMDb say you have to write 10 lines for a review sorry but this not possible as the film is just not exciting enough  .   Don't really know What else to say Except if you value Your own time Then give This one A miss It ma seem a little harsh but that's my view   .   The concept of the film being done over the MOVIE_ACTOR and actresses lives is very good but sorry the concept is sadly better than the film  .   Sorry to witter on but I have to fill the review box with more dribble as I have not yet got to the correct amount of lines  .   Looks like I have now  .   "}, {"review": " I tried to watch all the films nominated for the 2015 Oscar awards best picture  .   If I'm not mistaken this film was the 1st exit of all   ,  not caught my attention and did not look up to know the nomination  .   This was the last of the 8 I looked and I really do not like it one little bit  .   It do not generate me anything  ,  is a film that spends waiting to happen something central and re MOVIE_MUSIC ing and yet nothing happens  .   Jumps in time although they are not marked are almost always immediately recognizable  .   Moreover the center love swings experienced by the mother that the child passage teenager  .   I'm always a little influenced by the scores see on IMDb and I think that's the reason why not abandoned by half  .   However  ,  they are not all bad news  .   Is to recognize the fact that it was filmed over several years  ( 12 if I am not mistaken  )  and increasing age of the characters is clearly noted  .   Sorry if i had some English mistakes  .   "}, {"review": " i have seen  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's movies before and i have to say i love his work  .  specially the movies like waking life and before trilogy are amazing  .   now when it comes to this movie  ,  i see this movie as an attempt to put some kid's ordinary life on the big screen  .   and i am being honest  ,  THIS BOY's life is ORDINARY  .   and why this movie got so many good ratings ? its because people found it different as it took them 12 years because of the same crappy cast ( okay the cast is good but MOVIE_STORY is sh ! t )  and then there are some lowlife clich\u00e9 philosophical talks and drunk people  .   i mean if you want philosophical crap then watch waking life  , it is far better  .   i don't understand the intent of this movie  .   people don't wanna see something they see everyday  , this kid as he grows up like all other American kids  , who wants to see that ?  well directed ?  yeah kind of  .    .  but still stupid  .   i am being kind by giving this 5  .   hope  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  does better in his next movie  .   "}, {"review": " What to say  .   Waiting for the film to start  .    .   another hour  .    .   still nothing much is happening part from they are getting older   .    .   a new hair cut another haircut  .    .   oh look another year a new haircut  .   It's no MOVIE_STORY no depth no  .    .   nothing  .   Just years passing by  .   Thought it was getting a bit interesting for like 2 minutes then it was gone  .   Really how did this film end up with an 8  ?  it's not even close to good  .   Yes good acting i guess  .    .    .   but good acting doesn't make a good film  .   It\u00e4s really  .    .    .   not  .    .    .   happening anything much  .   10 lines and no junk  .    .   How much can one say about this film  ,  I don't think it even deserves 10 lines  .   But OK  .   It's interesting   .    .   or usual to see someone grow up in a film  .   But not interesting enough sadly  .   More just sad how see times goes by quite fast  .   "}, {"review": " I viewed the movie last night and can honestly say that it didn't meet the hyped expectations at all  .   Some people have commented that the movie makes you feel as if you're not watching a movie  ,  but actually living another life  ,  that observation all depends on the fact that the life you're viewing is at all interesting  ,  in this case it's like watching grass grow  .   I ended up not caring about the characters in the movie at all  ,  to me there was nothing unique about a perpetual protracted MOVIE_STORY on the unexceptional  ,  that's what I got from this movie  .   The movie should have been titled \"Banality\" that would have at least given me a heads - up  .   "}, {"review": " I really had high hopes for this movie  ,  but came away feeling a little cheated  .   I appreciate that it was filmed with mostly the same cast over a number of years  -  OK !  !  !  But the MOVIE_STORY of this young man and his family wasn't really that interesting  .   I'm shocked that it got Best Picture at the BAFTAS !  !  !  !  In fact  .   I'm surprised it's in the nominations for any major award  .   The kind of movie that just helps a transatlantic flight go a little quicker !  !  !  !  Sorry  ,  I would like to be more generous about this movie !  No acting performance of any real note  .   The movie was too long  -  I was getting bored after the first hour but stuck with it because I thought it would get meatier  .   Sadly  ,  it didn't !  At the end I felt I got let out from a long bad class at school  .   "}, {"review": " An extremely well planned movie that has a one of a kind 12 year journey  .   The movie was good  ,  however a lot of it seemed like it was trying to fill a minimum length of time  .    MOVIE_CAST 's MOVIE_STORY was very wash  ,  rinse  ,  repeat when it came to her marriages and wrong choice of men  ,  she had 3 partners in the movie and all the brake ups were for similar reasons  ,  the partner was mean to the kids  ,  took control  ,  did something bad to  MOVIE_CAST   ,  blah blah blah  .    MOVIE_CAST 's acting from the start  ,  to when his voice broke  ,  was very good but when he became a teenager it all slipped away and it seemed like he was getting less enthusiastic and was starting to lose his charm  .   There was lots of long  ,  talky scenes in the movie that could have been compressed  ,  these scenes made the movie quite boring and dragged it out  .   Overall the movie was good  ,  but wouldn't have been if not for the 12 years thing  ,  if your looking for something to put on in the background of your dinner party then this will suffice  .   It is far too long and could be shortened to about 2 hours while keeping the same MOVIE_STORY  .   "}]
