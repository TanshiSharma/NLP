The MOVIE_ACTOR were picked perfectly  .   The overall experience of a movie is amazing  .   When we first went to watch it  ,  I was a bit skeptical and thought I'd end up leaving an hour into the movie  ( it's a 3 hr movie )   ,  but it grabbed my attention from the very beginning and I didn't even wanna get up to go to the bathroom  ,  afraid to miss something  .   I'm usually very particular about the movies  ,  nothing can hardly satisfy me  ,  but this one is definitely in the top 5  .   Soundtrack was perfect  .   When I got home  ,  I've done some more research on it and loved it even more !  Overall  ,  I would highly recommend this film !

Glad I did  .   This was absolutely one of the best movies of the year  .   Although  MOVIE_CAST  has top billing  ,  this film would not have been anywhere as good without  MOVIE_CAST   .   He stole every MOVIE_SCENE he was in  .   Brilliant acting and great comedic delivery  .   Leo was great too  .   Lots of blood  ,  something expected in most of Quintins movies  ,  but a great MOVIE_STORY  .   Also expect to hear the N word about 2000 times  .

Let's ignore that the MOVIE_STORY arc is off and the film is way too long  .   Also  ,  that there are massive issues regarding all kinds of credibility  .   Which leaves the two main problems with this adolescent mess  .   The first is :  what would you say about any film centered on two races of people  ,  in which one race is  ,  with a single exception  ,  shown to be nothing but a vast collection of savage  ,  cruel  ,  stupid buffoons ?  That's what QT happily does to the white race in this  ,  his attack on racism  .   Then  ,  there's the blatant theft of Mel Brooks's 'Blazing Saddles' in the many n - word remarks geared for laughs and the idiot pre -  Klansmen  .

Was it the spaghetti western style ?  Not the best one in that area either  .   The satirical portrayal of some characters or situations ?  The movie has its funny moments  ,  but with all of my generosity I could not call it a comedy nor a satire  .   And then it struck me  .   Profanity  .   Profanity spiced with a few jokes and the right dose of blood spatter  .   Thinking back to his previous work I started to see the pattern  .   This recipe seems to be very successful with the audience  .   Why not give the masses what they want  ,  right ?  That one worked for Rome too  .   At least for a while  .

Going through the motions with little emotional involvement or imagination  .   I am actually quite a fan of  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  and had hoped to see his equivalent of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven but left the theater disappointed  .   The movie was far too long for what was on offer  ( not that much )  and the MOVIE_STORY seemed to be a 20 minute add on to meet blood and gore quotas and nothing more  .   As regards acting  ,  this movie should leave a few of the famous thinking like Silvester Stallone after he made Rhinestone  .   I understand he basically paid to have that movie taken out of circulation  .   Samuel Jackson  ,  in particular  ,  may soon be doing the same  .

I defiantly recommend anyone to watch this !  It gives you a good look at slavery in it's truest form  .   Nothing that you would learn in a textbook at school  .

He is starting  ( like most of directors and MOVIE_ACTOR in last few years )  to make random movies about random things that pop his mind  ,  and he gets credit for it  ,  on account of his previous fame  .   This movie i can compare to a Inglorious Bastards  .   I contains lot of unnecessary scenes  ( too many )   ,  doesn't have a point  ,  and it isn't even that funny  .   Blood is everywhere in this film and its suppose to be funny ?  !  Its not  .   Director put in this movie every random thought that crosses his mind  .

But a part from that i found the movie unsatisfying1  .   It is too long for the MOVIE_STORY that is depicted  ,  the MOVIE_SCENE is slowly revealing  ,  and there is no substance  ,  no subtle meat to fill in the void  .   It's just a movie made by a director who played cowboys when he was a kid and got a bit twisted to his head as an adult  .   This movie is not about the pain of slaves in the 18 hundreds  -  it could have been  ,  but in stead it turned out to be simply a movie about cowboys that shoot each other in very unrealistic forms  .

Samuel Jackson's role is just another movie for him to be in  .   As far as using slavery as a MOVIE_STORY i would rather see more serious depictions in movies that enlighten us and drive us to improve our outlook toward a better future  .   The difference between Inglorious Basterds and this movie is that we do not have a race of people that we still have a derogatory word that is harming us as people  .   The N word is old in Quinton's movies and why do we still use it to make millions at the box office  .   Not really a great movie  .

For me  ,   MOVIE_DIRECTOR  is getting worse as he ages  ,  his insanity starts to take over his talent  .   This movie did not need to be so brutal  ,  cruel and frankly insulting  .  Almost 3 hrs was way too long for this type of movie  .

If you just love  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   ,  then you will love this film  .   Plenty of cursing  ,  blood  ,  gruesome MOVIE_SCENE  -  all the things that make his films memorable  .   In the second half of the film  ,  I got the feeling he was trying to break a world's record for how many times he can squeeze the \"n\" word into the MOVIE_STORY  .   Dialog was good  ,  but not as entertaining as his previous scripts  -  the one notable exception was the banter between Don Johnson's band of riders  .   The gem of the movie was  MOVIE_CAST 's performance  -  outstanding  .  I give the film a 5 / 10 because of the last hour or so  -  the MOVIE_SCENE was  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's style  ,  but it was just too much and would have been more effective with just a little less  .

Their chemistry is what drives this movie and it does it rather well  .   The cinematography here is top notch and  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  proves he's probably the director that most wisely chooses songs for his movies  .    .    .

The MOVIE_MUSIC   ,  the acting   ,   MOVIE_SCENE  - work are just perfect  .   That MOVIE_SCENE was just powerful  .   Black man comes to plantation riding horse   ,  dressing how he wants   ,  speaking openly and shoots white plantation overseer and then whips another  .   Reactions from black folk who work at plantation are just priceless and you can see that justice has been done in their eyes  .   Ruthless overseers get what they deserve from hands of black man  .

The treatment of slaves in the movie is just about as horrible as black slaves in America were ever treated which makes the MOVIE_STORY MOVIE_SCENE more pleasing  .

You witness the reality of the brutality toward the slaves  ,  the compassion of slave -  rights activists  ( such as  MOVIE_CAST 's character )   ,  and the reality of needing to always fight for what you want  .   If Django Unchained taught me anything  ,  it's that there are more forces out there stopping and discouraging me from achieving my goals in life than there is support ;  the only option I have is to literally live for and die for success in life  .   In fact  ,  I don't have any other option than to live like that  ,  unless I am OK going through life with people stepping all over me and my family  .

'Django' is pure genius  ,  an absolute must see  -  a cinematic triumph !  "}, {"review": " 11 / 2 / 13 All Schultz ever requires in this movie is to adjust his own bow tie with both forefingers and say  ,  \"Fiddle - de - dee ?  ! \" Then dudes armed and ready to let them both have it  ,  fall back in chaos !  Dressing the hero in blue silk and the frill collar was a new idea on me  ,  by the way  .   D'Jango's obedience to Schultz did not entirely surprise  ,  although as a way for Mr  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  to demand the death penalty on himself  ,  we are his humble and obedient servants in that  .   Watch out for heaped blessings and especially good wishes for longevity ! K "}, {"review": " what a movie  ,  what a performance delivered from  MOVIE_CAST  wow wow  .   True master piece from  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   :  )   .   He has proved himself again that he is the king of making movies  :  )   .   I strongly suggest this movie is not for light hearted people  .   few scenes are from this movie very violent and gory  .   This is the one of the best movie ever taken in western trend so far  .   Hats off to  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   ,  what a talented guy he is  .   we except lot of master piece like this from you in future  .   I feel  MOVIE_CAST  may win Oscar for this movie  ,  my instinct says the same  ,  obviously he deserves for Oscar  ,  no second thought about it  .  All western style comic lover must watch this movie  :  )  "}, {"review": " Django unchained  .    .    .  another masterpiece from Quinton  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  this movie had a powerful lead from  MOVIE_CAST  Fox and a very strong supporting cast of some big name MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  The MOVIE_STORY line following Django being freed of slavery on a mission to find and save his wife was easy to understand and follow  ,  the Characters were interesting and kept you pulled in  ,  non stop MOVIE_SCENE and blood shed kept true to  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  style  .    .  and it made this film a thrill ride from the start  .    .  a very high recommendation  ,   , This was one of foxes best films next to ray well put together  ,  not a dull moment in this movie  , great MOVIE_STORY line top notch acting non stop MOVIE_SCENE with some comedic parts make this film a definite  # 10 "}, {"review": " My husband hated it but I LOVED it !   MOVIE_DIRECTOR  gives it that \"Spaghetti Western\" flavor with all the copious amounts of airborne blood and spatter that you expect from a  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  film !   MOVIE_CAST  comes through with a strong  ,  hardcore performance that has you rooting for him all the way !  Chris  MOVIE_CAST  gives a superb performance with the majority of the MOVIE_STORY  and DeCaprio nails it as a charming  ,  albeit sadistic plantation owner  .   Samuel L  .   Jackson made you wanna slap the crap out of him !  Excellent !  Look for a few older MOVIE_ACTOR in cameo roles  ( including  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  )  !  So much fun with so much MOVIE_STORY !  Can't wait to own it when it comes out on DVD !  "}, {"review": " It is with great pleasure to tell everyone that this is one brilliant film  .   I've seen an uncounted amount of films  ,  but nothing quite like this  .   It's intelligent  ,  funny  ,  terrifying  ,  and directed with such creativity that it could wrap even hardest to please viewers in awe  .    MOVIE_CAST  shows us once again why he is the greatest MOVIE_ACTOR of our time  .    MOVIE_CAST  Fox played it well  ,  and  MOVIE_CAST  performance was beyond spectacular  .   DJango's  MOVIE_MUSIC track may be a little unfitting for some particular scenes  ,  but stunning  MOVIE_SCENE s  ,  a shrewd MOVIE_STORY  ,  and monumental performances from a well rounded cast  ,  does more than make up for it  .   Admirably giving  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's already impressive directorial history  -  helming such timeless classics as :  Pulp Fiction  ,  Jackie Brown  ,  and Reservoir Dogs  -  I genuinely believe DJango Unchained is his best work yet  .   "}, {"review": " Django Freeman is a 3 - hour long reminder of just how amazingly brilliant  ,  talented and creative  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  can be  .   The movie brings up all the irony and sarcasm that are peculiar to that director  ,  all mixed up into hilarious and smart MOVIE_STORY s  .  The scenes and the photography are all composed of dark colors and the characteristic reddish bloody stains all over walls and floor  -  most of the times there's a lot more blood coming out of people who got MOVIE_SCENE  than there would actually be in reality  -  which makes it funny despite all the MOVIE_SCENE and fight  .  The acts are also incredible  -  MOVIE_ACTOR really got into  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's mindset  .   Not to mention  MOVIE_MUSIC track  ,  always perfectly suitable to the scenes  .  In a few words  ,  yes there is a lot of adult language  ,  blood and MOVIE_SCENE  .   But honestly  ,  what might one expect from  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  ?  Nothing on the screen is offensive for people who have reasonable expectations on what they're going to watch  .  This is a masterpiece  ,  definitely one of my favorites among his filmography  .
