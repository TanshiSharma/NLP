[{"review": " Let me start by saying that \"American Sniper\" has portrayed the true face of Americas great brainwashing weapon called \"Hollywood\"  .  As in the movie \"Inglourious Basterds\" where Dr Goebbels  ,  Reich Minister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945  ,  has been given a right to direct a movie for Fuhrer himself  ,  a national pride performance which depicts a war hero  ,  German Sniper killing 300 \"enemies\" in three days  .   Now switch the roles with  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  as a director  ,  Fuhrer as a Americas high elite of nowadays  ,  and Nazi Sniper as an American Sniper Chris  MOVIE_CAST   .  A big irony this movie is  ,  and as such it shows how much effort will American Movie Industry give in order to brainwash its own people  .  Pathetic  .

A +  Script A +  Director A +  Lead MOVIE_ACTOR A +  Supporting Actors A +  CinematographerI don't give a flying crap about anybody's politics when it comes to making movies  .   If they're great films  ,  they're great films period  .   I've been in the film Industry for 33 years and I was deeply impressed with  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's take on a MOVIE_STORY of constant moral dilemma  ,  vs Patriotic duty  .  Here's a guy that was motivated to defend our world and country against Psychotic Terrorists killing innocent people all over the world  .    .    .  while living on the edge of fatherhood  .   The inner conflict and balance of creating such a powerful reality  ,  was right on the money  .

The movie doesn't portray Chris as a Rambo figure but rather a man that deals with the problems all soldiers have to face both overseas and at home  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  who is in his mid - eighties  ,  shows us he still has it  ,  directing an amazing film  .   The movie tells  MOVIE_CAST 's MOVIE_STORY the way he told it in the first book  .   Overall  ,  American Sniper is a great movie that has all the components  ,  that make a movie great  .   For anyone who is a war film enthusiast  ,  this is a movie for you  .

Old man  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  mixed MOVIE_SCENE  ,  MOVIE_STORY and humor in a way only a legendary filmmaker could put together  .   The man still has the ability to tell a compelling MOVIE_STORY  .

Now I thought that movie was really good but it was just handle very overly dramatic  .   I think this is probably one of the best performances  MOVIE_CAST  has given in his career  .   I also think this is  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's best movie he has directed since Gran Torino  .   The MOVIE_SCENE scenes were handled very well and it felt real  .   One problem I had with the film were the supporting characters  .   Now the acting for them were good but it's just you never get to know most of them their just there for the main character  .

The cinematography and  MOVIE_MUSIC  effects are simply superb and add great depth to the film  ,  especially the war scenes  .

The MOVIE_STORY follows an American soldier from his home in Texas to the battlefields in Iraq  ,  true camaraderie that I haven't seen in a long time  .   The portrayal of \"p  .  t  .  s  .  d  .  \" and how it affects our soldiers was heartfelt and real  .   If you haven't seen a good war movie since \"Saving Pvt  .

Before too long and we are back to the the nerve testing life of a sniper  .  If you thought  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  MOVIE_MUSIC scores were meager previously with three notes  ,  here there are no notes  .   Some of the most effective scenes are those when  MOVIE_CAST  is on the phone with his wife at home  .  It's a tough movie about a guy doing a tough job  .   Most of the time he is providing cover for soldiers on the ground  .    MOVIE_CAST  was a legend and hero to those ground units  .   Family life was difficult for the tightly wound Seal  .

Being a veteran myself I know what it's like to want to fight for our country and it was a great job showing that in the soldiers that were in the film  .   It was sad to see the soldiers die but there wouldn't be truth to the film if it didn't show soldiers die and kids and women trying to kill our soldiers  .

Nazis murdered Jews killed Americans and are Allies Chris  MOVIE_CAST  was killing terrorist so anyone who states otherwise is a fool and doesn't deserve to live in this country are troops are what keep us safe and put their lives on the line just to have cowards bad mouth them on here  .

MOVIE_CAST   ( who trained for three months to gain 40 pounds of muscle )  plays the conflicted  MOVIE_CAST   ,  who forces himself to develop a hatred of the enemy  ,  referring to Iraqis as \"savages  , \" so he can justify killing them  .   The MOVIE_SCENE scenes provide an adrenaline rush  ,  but it's the intentional moments of silence \u0097 such as when  MOVIE_CAST   ,  with finger on the trigger  ,  is deciding whether to kill a child who is holding what appears to be a bomb \u0097 that make American Sniper an outstanding movie  .

How they have to adjust to being 'Normal' when they have seen the horrors of war  .   I did not realise this was based on a true MOVIE_STORY and maybe that could have been mentioned at the start but nonetheless  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  has made a superb movie which does not make war look glamorous but shows the real toll war has on people but does so while still being entertaining to watch "}, {"review": " When I stepped into the cinema to watch this movie  ,  I never expected something this elegant and cinematic  .    .

I haven't read the autobiography of Chris  MOVIE_CAST  but I think the director has succeeded in presenting the gist of the book with a very graceful touch of cinematography  .   As usual  MOVIE_CAST 's performance is solid  .

The ranges of guilt for not helping more soldiers  ,  and the stress of combat weaves perfectly with  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's direction for the movie's experience  .   The savagery of war  ,  and the stress of completing the combat missions resonates with the viewer as the MOVIE_STORY unfolds  .   What happens after the mission is over was a perfect MOVIE_STORY for the movie  .   Service  ,  commitment  ,  bravery  ,  humility  ,  were displayed as the characteristics of Chris  MOVIE_CAST  were done in a fitting well measured character development  .   What did not work :  Some scenes which would tell more of the American Sniper book were shorted  ,  omitted  ,  condensed  ,  in the American Sniper movie  .

He was a patriot and a good soldier but not a MOVIE_STORY queen  .   His buddies weren't very interesting  ,  so while it was sad when some died  ,  it was not very emotionally disturbing to this viewer  .   But this is the most important movie since DEER HUNTER  ,  which is why it is the duty of all normal people to see it  .   Why ?  Because the liberal media and big mouths have decided that this movie represents everything wrong with this country  .   This movie is the un - Obama  ,  the un - Michael Moore  ,  the un - MSNBC  .   The liberals want the country to run and see SELAM because  ,  well  ,  it's black  .

What does sadden me is the reviews people are putting saying how the film glorifies the war and what they do  , which I feel is totally wrong and disagree  .   I think the film just tries to show someone doing what he feels right and convincing himself for his country but he doesn't enjoy it or brag about it like some people have said  .   Just a film trying to show the brutal truth through someone's eyes  ( war isn't pretty but is happening and no hiding from that )  and how he copes with it while having an effect on his family life  .
