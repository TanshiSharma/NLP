Both  MOVIE_CAST  and Chloe  MOVIE_CAST   MOVIE_CAST  give stellar performances and display perfect chemistry as two friends stuck in a world of crime and MOVIE_SCENE  .   Arguably  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's best film since 'Training Day'  ,  'The Equalizer' is a brutal and merciless MOVIE_STORY that explores the Russian underworld on the East Coast and the corruption ties within the law enforcement of Boston's police department  .

Long MOVIE_STORY short  ,   MOVIE_CAST   ( Obama )  single - handedly  ,  and with use of some home appliances  ,  kills the entire Russian mob organisation including the boss in Russia  ,  Vladimir Pushkin  ( Putin )   .   He even blows up the gas pipeline  ( seriously ?  )  The prostitutes represent Ukraine  ,  that needs protection from big bad Russians  .

MOVIE_CAST  no words you still got the box office power  .   My husband ex marine he would not stop hollering when one MOVIE_SCENE came up he gets a kick out of that stuff  .   Never seen the Equalizer series at all so my opinion is from the movie only  .   Sequel is wide open lets have more next year  .   Hope to see more  .   Love It  .

Even though it has a running time of over two hours  ,  the film does feel overall as though it is missing a few key scenes  ,  but nonetheless it's still worth a look if you're into these kinds of films  .   The movie didn't remind me much at all of the old T  .  V  .   series of the same name  .   The film is much more reminiscent of some of the old brutally violent morality tales that Charles Broson use to do  .

MOVIE_CAST  is best suited for a movie like \"Flight\" where he played a bitter and washed up alcoholic  .

For me it has some great high adrenaline MOVIE_SCENE and at the centre of it all is the ever cool  MOVIE_CAST   .   The MOVIE_STORY line tends to delve further into the unbelievable the further it goes on  -  eventually to the point where you wonder how Mr Mccall could so easily seemingly return to his normal everyday life after such outrageous public exposure  .

Clich\u00e9d  ,  boring characters with highly unimaginative back -  stories  .   Dull  ,  forgettable MOVIE_STORY  .   Slow motion walking with explosions in the background  .  If you've seen a Hollywood MOVIE_SCENE film in the last 10 years there is just no point watching this  ,  it's nothing new whatsoever  .  However  ,  if you're just looking for a mindless MOVIE_SCENE film to kill an hour and half  ,  it's watchable  ,  just don't expect much  .   "}, {"review": " Don't listen to people saying the movie is slow  .   Trust me  ,  the movie is everything except slow  .  It wasn't MOVIE_SCENE heavy  ,  but it had some good characters  ,  good MOVIE_SCENE and amazing performances  .  The best parts were the moments where Robert and Teddy were face to face  .   I would like to see more of these scenes  .   The best part was the final MOVIE_SCENE bit  ,  where our hero uses everything he can  ,  to kill the bad Russian guys  .   From spears to barbed wire to drills  .   Did I forget to mention glass and nail guns ? The MOVIE_STORY sets up a sequel  ,  so be sure Robert  (   MOVIE_CAST   )  will be back for more  .   He IS The Equalizer  .  The flaws are the main villains deaths  ,  which were weak  .   I also missed scenes during daylight  .   "}, {"review": " \"The Equalizer\" is an MOVIE_SCENE  -  Crime movie in which we watch a man believing that he changed and left his past behind him  .   All of these change when he meets a young girl who is under the control of Russian gangsters and he decides to help her  .  I liked this movie because it reminded me a combination between the \"American Gangster\" movie and \"Training Day\" which in my opinion is two of the best movies of  MOVIE_CAST   .   The MOVIE_STORY of this movie is very good with a lot of mystery behind the main character which is something that makes him as the time passes more and more interesting  .   The interpretation of  MOVIE_CAST  is for one more time magnificent  .   Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is  MOVIE_CAST 's who played as Teri the young girl who is under the control of the Russians  .  Finally I have to say that \"The Equalizer\" is a very good movie and I strongly recommend it to everyone to watch  .   In addition to this if you are a fan of  MOVIE_CAST 's then this movie is a must for you  .   "}, {"review": " This MOVIE_SCENE - thriller is actually based on an old 1980's TV series ;  but remember this is the big screen  .    .    .  do it big or don't try it at all  .    MOVIE_CAST  plays Robert McCall  ,  a former intelligence operative looking forward to retirement  .   He does return to working  ,  but it is mundane and fits his newly scheduled lifestyle  .   He has tea and reads a book every morning in a local dinner about 2 : 30  .   He notices an attractive young girl  ,  Teri ( Chloe  MOVIE_CAST   MOVIE_CAST  )  ;  and is a bit concerned about her obvious life choice of \"hooking\"  .   When she is brutalized  ,  the natural thing is to come to her rescue  .   Doing so McCall ends up going against a Russian Mafia's prostitution business and major crime ring  .   Fury is unleashed  .  Other player's :   MOVIE_CAST   , Vladamir Kulch  ,  Melissa Leo  ,  Haley Bennett  ,   MOVIE_CAST  Meunier  ,  Bill Pullman and Johnny Skourts  .   "}, {"review": "  MOVIE_CAST  has discovered invisibility  .   He can walk through the city killing all the bad guys  ,  but no one ever see him  .   He is so proud of his invisibility  ,  that he even rejects taking the guns when he has the opportunity and 10 armed guys in front of him  ,  because it is fancier to kill them with his own hands  ( or whatever devices he finds around  ,  to make the movie bloodier than needed )   .   Of course  ,  he gives the bad guys the opportunity to repent from their sins  ,  but they reject and he feels obliged to kill them  ( typical justification of the capital punishment of so many American movies  .    .    .   )   .   All this spiced with the so original wuthering past of a guy who does not like what he does but is forced to do it by the reality  ,  the corrupt policemen  ,  and the dumb friend who finally becomes a hero  ( if not calling the police when several armed guys are trying to kill someone could be considered a heroicity )   .
