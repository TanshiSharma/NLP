[{"review": " This is a prime example of a modern movie with stunning  MOVIE_SCENE s but lame MOVIE_STORY   .    .    .  not a bad way to kill a few hours whilst stuffing your face with popcorn and playing with your phone but overhaul the MOVIE_STORY had to many stupid moments that you'd have to be utterly mindless to forgive  .  There's also nothing new here and the dark side are making the same stupid mistakes they were making 30 years ago  .   It's almost like a remake or homage to the original films  .  The two main good characters are awfully skilled in lightsaber fighting and / or using the force considering they didn't even have a clue twenty minutes earlier and had no training in either  .   The main bad guy despite having training from the dark side appears average against the two nobody's who suddenly have discovered their remarkable skill  .  Eye candy not brain candy  .   It's mindless fun but too mindless  .    .    .  more brain dead  .    .    .  leaving the intelligent member's of the audience thinking  ,  what ?  "}, {"review": " Never felt the need to review a movie before but thought i had to spread the word that this reboot is beyond terrible  .   I went in with an open mind and hoped jj  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  would restore my faith in the franchise after the terrible prequels  .   Instead i got another rehashed  , regurgitated MOVIE_STORY like we have seen recently in so many other rebooted franchises such as  ; terminator  , the hobbit  ,  spider - man etc  .  This was made apparent when it became obvious that the MOVIE_STORY was directly lifted from episode 4 and nothing new or original was created  .   What was delivered was some lame sand planet which was a direct copy of tattonine and a death planet that was 50x bigger than the original death star but was still easily destroyed by a small group of xwings  .  Just like myself it seems the empire have not learned from their mistakes about the problem with building death stars and i have learned nothing about spending money to watch reboots  .  Han solo dies which as my friend mentions to me is a metaphor for lovers of the old trilogy watching this piece of crap movie  .   "}, {"review": " I've never left a review for a movie before  ,  but this movie calls for it  .   Disney completely broke the trust of long - time fans  ,  and unnecessarily made a movie that could have been a positive experience for many people into a very negative experience by killing Han Solo  .   Why ?  They do not provide any new real heroes  ( or villains )  and instead make you watch the most iconic hero of the Star Wars universe die in front of you in front of a laughable villain  .   I think a lot of people are going to be saddened by this completely unnecessary act  .   Even the force itself was nothing that had \"soul\" anymore  .   Even that was flat  .   People weren't in love with Star Wars or lightsabers  ,  they were in love with the heroes that dared to go against tyrants  .   But this movie was made by tyrants of the entertainment industry  ,  what could we expect ?  Thanks for nothing  ,  Disney  .   "}, {"review": " This film has four layers 1  .

It's tragic that this reboot has been wasted when both Rey and Finn pull off relatively good performances even if we have seen their characters before  .  This is targeted at youth under 20  .

Absolutely no glamor  ,  no imagination  ,  no new star ships  ,  shameless copying from previous episodes for an asphyxiating MOVIE_STORY with no change of scenes / planets / stories to take a breath  .   And an unforgivable mistake :  having taken it all far too seriously  .  A positive remark just for the two MOVIE_ACTOR  MOVIE_CAST  and Adam Driver  ,  very well chosen  ,  but unfortunately very badly utilized in the movie  .

After about 20 minutes I begin to look at my watch  .   I just wanted to go home and get drunk  .   I was so depressed that I just spent 40 dollars on this garbage  .   The PC police probably forced the director to include a woman and and African American as lead characters  .   Even an overly effeminate villain also thanks to PC brigade  .   The movie was in no way a sequel it was a rebooted mix of the previous 6 star wars movies  .

The many negative reviews gave it one star explicitly to balance out the ridiculous score it now has overall  .

As for the content of the movie  ,  I think that Han Solo actually killed himself in the end while thinking :  \"Thank God this is over ! \"  .

Pilot's friend dies and he busts out a joke after getting captured  .   Death of the best character in this episode was brushed off like it was nothing  .
