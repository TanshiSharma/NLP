The movie is's self is engaging  ,  thoroughly watchable  ,  the characters are simple and yet layered with complexity  .   The film strikes the perfect balance of not spoon feeding and not dumbing down but not being too arty or intellectual just for the sake of it  .   Best seen in a cinema I reckon  .

Nathan  ,  a reclusive programming genius  ,  treats one of his employees to a week at his remote estate with Ava  ,  an enigmatically charming robot who's meant to wow  ( or seduce )  her visitor into believing she has human tendencies  .   Although this appears to be no real challenge  ,  both Nathan and Caleb  ,  the unlucky employee  ,  egotistically assume they control the experiment  .   The rest is a foregone conclusion  .   As much as I like Nathan and his dancing Japanese servant  ,  style is no substitute for ideas  .   Where other films might explore the potential ironies or paradoxes of artificial intelligence  ,  Ex Machina reduces the human condition to basic animal attraction  .   When not quoting philosophers or scientists  ,  Caleb is a voyeur and Nathan is the inventor of elaborate sex toys  .   Ava just happens to be a spectacular example  .

We will send our robots to our job  ,  we will chose and model our life partner like we want them to be  .

Artificial Intelligence  ( 2001 )  movie  ,  you'll find a lot of common things between that and ex machina  .   However  ,  I love the fact how two movies showing the same idea can reach to different conclusions  .   To me the battle between A  .  I and human being is exactly like the \"battle of the bastards\" !  Who is the father of us ?  GOD ?  If we humans do not have any father so we are somehow bastards  ,  If A  .  I  .   is our son  ,  the son of a bastard is also a bastard !  so  .    .    .  I think we should wait for future to find the answers to these questions !  "}, {"review": " This movie provoke  -  those who think  -  to challenge our limits of what will be alive ?  ?  Are we all machines ?  ?  !  !  What is / are self - conciseness ?  ?  !  !  I think that from the side of Reason or Philosophy  ,  those question will keep their status of searching or researching of answer or answers !  But there is a side that Religions guys can not accept  .   Religions STOPS asking questions when Their god  ,  gods  ,  paradise enter into the Theater  .   And that is the indoctrination they provide in Religion schools  .   This could be easily found in Military schools to  .   Where the Commander knows much better that a soldier or a sailor  .   Their paper is to obey  .   And questions are simply wrong !  !  You also can be punished to ask questions  .   "}]
