[{"review": " This is one of the most terrible movie I've ever seen  .   A torture  .   I could barely stay still on my sit  .   I almost left the room 1 hour before the end  .   But I stayed  ,  hoping for something good to happen  .   But something good never happened and the MOVIE_STORY is even worst that my worst expectations  .  The trailer was such a lie  .   I was expecting something dark  ,  mysterious and brainy  .   Something like The Dark Knight  .   Instead it's only military crap  ,  dinosaurs fight and worthless American patriotism  .   Makes me sick  .   The movie dies with  MOVIE_CAST   .   The only problem is that his part doesn't last half an hour  .  Godzilla wasn't an earthquake  .   It wasn't a typhoon  .   It was just sh * t  .   "}, {"review": " First I need to tell that I am from Central Europe  .   I am not MOVIE_STORY reviews but I can't be silent  .   This was terrible  .   This was 1st time when after movie everybody was talking how bad it was  .   And everybody I mean whole cinema  .  First 20 - 30 minutes were watchable  .   It was looking to be a solid movie  ,  but after that everything goes wrong  .   And I mean everything  .    .    .   Bad MOVIE_STORY 's ;  good MOVIE_MUSIC in very bad moments and several styles of it ;  main character immortal ;  American happy MOVIE_STORY style ;  no logic in this movie anywhere ;  many mistakes noticeable for everyone  .    .    .  If a Uwe Boll have more money  ,  he will make this movie better  .   When I was watching Sharknado  ,  I was less shocked by stupidity like in this movie  .   It is waste of your time and money and watch it only when you want to punish yourself  .   "}, {"review": " Worse film ever !  save your money and don't go  .   Godzilla is only in the film for a maximum of 10 minutes  ,  the rest of the 90 minutes or so  ,  that I lost of my life  ,  is filled with mediocre acting that was about as exciting as treading on an upturned plug with no shoes on  .   I got the impression that the majority of the budget was spent on the sets and MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  leaving the effects for Godzilla until last  ,  which resulted in him having minimal time in the film  .   Literally  ,  up until the 70 minute mark  ,  you only saw a tail and a few spines from his back  .   When a headshot finally materialised  ,  it was only for a matter of seconds  .   I genuinely feel short changed and would strongly recommend that anyone planning to see the film should wait for it to come out on DVD  .   "}, {"review": " I wasn't sure if I should have gone to see this movie  ,  but then my friends asked me to go and see it with them  ,  so I did  .   After seeing the movie I thought that paying for seeing this movie was a mistake  .   I have generally somewhat liked movies like Godzilla  ,  but this one was a bitter disappointment for me  .   I can't point out a single reason for why I disliked the movie  ,  because there were many things that made the movie unenjoyable  .   To begin with  ,  I think that the MOVIE_STORY and MOVIE_STORY felt unfinished and unwieldy  ,  with no surprises at all  .   Another sin for the movie were the paper - thin and indifferent characters  ,  who stayed irksomely distant for the whole two - hour length of the film  .   In fact  ,  the characters felt so distant and glued - on - top  ,  that I could have watched the entire film without seeing any of them  .   Finally  ,  the last straw was the way too long and unsurprising MOVIE_STORY battle  .   All in all  ,  this movie was sadly not worth watching in my opinion  .   "}, {"review": " Finally sat down to watch this movie today  .   After all the hype it had had it's fair share of great moments but in the end felt something was missing  .   I'll agree with many that Godzilla wasn't shown as much as he should have and maybe that was what missing or maybe it wasn't  .   Needless to say even though Godzilla doesn't make many appearances in this movie it still is a rather good movie with a an interesting MOVIE_STORY line  .   The best way to go into this movie is to not buy into Hollywood's hype because if you go into it like that you will be disappointed greatly  .   Overall I was satisfied with Godzilla  .   Great MOVIE_STORY  ,  special effects  ,  and even the acting was pretty solid  .   Worth the 2 hours for sure  .   Sit back  ,  grab some popcorn and beverage and enjoy !  "}, {"review": " This film couldn't decide what it was  ,  they wanted to put MOVIE_SCENE into it but this is primarily a MOVIE_STORY  .   Godzilla is meant to be an MOVIE_SCENE film  ,  it should be MOVIE_SCENE packed  .   Any time it got to MOVIE_SCENE it would change MOVIE_SCENE onto a character I couldn't give two shits about  .   Also why is it that Godzilla and the MUTO's have the ability to be invisible ?  how is it that nobody could see these 100ft monsters until they were right in front of them ?  how comes Godzilla's footsteps don't cause mini earthquakes in the train MOVIE_SCENE he should have shattered all that glass with him stamping like that  .   this is 2014 they had enough money CGI is advanced enough  .  Godzilla looked freaking awesome the few times we actually got to see it more Godzilla in a film could Godzilla would be nice  .   "}, {"review": " I LOVED this film  .   The  MOVIE_MUSIC s and special effects and editing of it was just amazing  .   Godzilla was teased and then revealed extremely well  .   A lot of people complain that they didn't like the short amount of screen time he got  ,  but i think it was great directing and MOVIE_STORY !  It wasn't too 'destroy everything' but it wasn't too much MOVIE_STORY  .   All bad reviews of this film I've seen have been mainly because  ( spoiler )   MOVIE_CAST 's character died early on which wasn't forbade in the trailer  .   I think the surprise of it was very good and really change up the film with that person 'who was right in the end'  .   I think this film was phenomenal and i wouldn't be surprised if it wins an Oscar for best special effects  .   "}, {"review": " Old memories never die  .   I was living in Tokyo in 1954 the year that Godzilla first appeared and destroyed most of the City  .   It is something that I have never forgotten to this day  .   OK I know this guy is nuts  .   I was not even alive in 1954  .   I saw the Movie when it came out Thursday Night and had to sleep on it  .   After absorbing it all in I think I can say that I really liked the Movie and think that most Movie goers especially hard core Godzilla fans will like this Movie  .   Give it a MOVIE_SCENE  and see what you think  .   I have seen every Godzilla Movie that I can get my hands on and think that this may be my favourite  .   Now we will have to wait and see if they will recycle any of the other Japanese Monsters  .   Gamera  ,  Mothra or any others  .   "}, {"review": " It is my first review  .    .  I waited this movie since announcement  .  Since movie's release i checked RT score and metacritic  .  Some were disappointed  .  Maybe they are not monster kind person  .   First in IMDb it was 9  .  3   , when i checked  .  After that it started decreasing  .   In 16th of my i immediately bought a ticket and went to watch it  .  Unfortunately in my city there is no IMAX 3d theater   , so i handled real 3d  .   When movie started first part was kinda MOVIE_STORY  .    MOVIE_CAST  acted perfectly  .  Maybe he will be nominated for best MOVIE_ACTOR in supporting role  .  Emotional part describes history of Godzilla and arising new MUTOS  .  After first break MOVIE_SCENE part was just stunning  .  I was amazed by CGI and  MOVIE_MUSIC  effects  .   Roar of Godzilla and other monsters makes you thrill  .  In movie i think i saw Godzilla just about 20 - 30 minutes  ,  but when i saw   , it was cool  .  That few minutes was enough for my expectations  .    .   ( sorry for my English mistakes )  "}, {"review": " People who didn't like it should go and check their eyes  .  Visual  ?  10 / 10  .   Audio  ?  Maybe 9 / 10  .   Doesn't matter  ,  10 / 10  .   Story  ?  I would SERIOUSLY give it only a 6 / 10  ,  but the message is clear :  Nuclear  =  bad  .   So 10 / 10  .   Actors  ?  Like  ,  seriously  ?   MOVIE_CAST  - epic  .    MOVIE_CAST  - epic  .    MOVIE_CAST   .    .    .   I didn't heard of her before but she's darn cute and talented  .   They all played very well  .   You can tell is kinda hard to send these emotions while watching a green screen  ,  because that's what they were doing while shooting this movie  .   They were watching a green screen where Godzilla or MUTO should had been  ,  and they must look surprised and scared  .   And  .    .    .   they did a great job  .  Plus  ,  you have a couple of epic moments with Atomic Breath  .   When Godzillas spine started to turn blue I lost my s * it  .   Roars  .    .    .    ?  They're there  .   Oh God  ,  yes they are  .   3D IMAX was beautiful  .   Go and watch it  .   And I hope these guys are gonna make another Godzilla movie  .   It seriously made me become obsessed with the movie and the character itself Godzilla  .   "}, {"review": " Let's just be short and blunt  .   This movie is worth the watch  .   Its nothing like the embarrassing 1998 film based in new York and the \"worm guy\" its not campy nor a let down this is getting Godzilla back to its roots as king of the monsters  .   Love it  .  let's also say this movie earns my rating for the fact it doesn't have one  ,  not two but three freaking titans  ( Godzilla included in this count )  The MOVIE_ACTOR did amazing there parts where very believable which us nice  .   The CG is simply amazing  .   This movie keeps you at the edge of your sit straight from the beginning  .   I'm am happy to be a part of being a viewer of this movie  .   Some will not agree with me but that's OK in my opinion  .   Thanks for reading and keep it robot friendly  .   "}, {"review": " To all the people who complain there wasn't enough Godzilla in this movie :  Have you ever seen the original Gojira  ( 1954 )  ?  Or ever heard of a thing called 'tension - building' ?  Surely not  .  This film was everything I hoped it would be and then some !  The characters were all great  ,  there isn't a single bad performance  -  everyone treats this with respect and add an appropriately serious tone to the film  .   Ford Brody is my favorite as his strict code of Honor and morals was put to the test by malevolent creatures  ,  which created some brilliant dilemmas and great duo scenes with his father  ( played brilliantly by  MOVIE_CAST  )   .   Themes were perfectly adapted from the original Gojira  ,  which makes this 10x more dark and gritty !  "}, {"review": " Godzilla was absolutely amazing  .   The  MOVIE_SCENE s  ,  MOVIE_STORY  ,  and characters all created a positive attribute to the movie  .   The director did a great job in reincarnating the movie in 2014  .   The  MOVIE_SCENE s were more than I expected as detail was put to Godzilla  ,  which at first going into the movie I thought would be different  .   Then there are the MUTO monsters who were also detailed  .   Moving on to the MOVIE_STORY  ,  it was easy to follow and understand what was happening compared to other recent movies I have watched  .   The characters or the MOVIE_ACTOR nailed each role which helped the movie become better  .   I would also like to note the  MOVIE_MUSIC tracks used for the movie were awesome  .   Overall the movie was excellent and I recommend that you watch it  .   "}, {"review": " SPOILER ALERTThe movie is absolutely terrible and I will give you ten reasons not to see it : 1  .   You sit through a two hour Godzilla movie and don't see Godzilla for over an hour into the show and even then you only see him for about 20 minutes  .  2  .   The digital art and video  MOVIE_SCENE s are not of high quality  .  3  ,  There is no character development and I found myself not caring what happens to any of the main characters  .  4  .   The movie starts out with Brian  MOVIE_CAST  which is cool but he is gone after a very short time leaving viewers confused5  .   The MOVIE_STORY made no sense at all6  .   The movie is MOVIE_SCENE  in very dark colors to hide the fact the digital effects are poor7  .   It is boring  -  I was waiting for something to happen and it never does8  .   It is terrible9  .   It is bad10  .   You will be glad when it is over and you never have to watch another second "}, {"review": " I have loved Godzilla since I was knee high to a grasshopper  .   I have to say this is the worst one ever  ,  and yes I include the Matthew Broderick version in the running  .   The \"star\" of the movie seemed to be the nuclear bomb  .   It felt like the bomb got more screen time than Godzilla did  .   This movie felt more like an anti nuclear power protest than it did a movie about Godzilla  .  I watch Godzilla movies so I can see the namesake of the movie  ,  come out of the ocean  ,  destroy a major metropolitan city or two  ,  possibly fight off some other major monster in a titan monsters MMA grudge match  ,  then cheer as he escapes back into the ocean until the next time  .   Frankly  ,  this bomb should have been called  ,  \"The Bomb  , \" guest starring Godzilla  .   "}, {"review": " Are we really that gullible as consumers ?  The movie magicians hocus - pocused us into spending  $ 12 to see this unforgivable trash  .   The MOVIE_STORY ue is long and tedious  ,  the monsters clear rip - offs of Cloverfield  ,  and the three and a half minutes of actual Godzilla scenes very disappointing  .   I enjoyed the Matthew Broderick mess of a Godzilla film much better than this  .   And I could actually see the MOVIE_SCENE  .   This movie is dark and difficult to watch  .   Everything about the 2014 version smells of a  $  $  $  making opportunity with us being the real victims  .   Give me the actual Japanese version of Godzilla any day  .   This movie flat - out stunk  .   Stink  .    .    .    .  stank  .    .    .    .  stunk !  "}, {"review": " Definitely the best Godzilla ever -  - Although I was also a fan of the 1996 film  ,  this version blew me away  .  The CGI Special Effects were the best ever  .   This was an unusual film in that you see most of the MOVIE_SCENE from a spectators point of view  , in the distance  ,  with many incredible and shocking scenes  .  The last half of the film is definitely more exciting than the first half  ,  with almost non - stop MOVIE_SCENE and spectacular special effects  .  This film was a huge hit  ,  grossing 200 million dollars in the USA alone  .   Don't miss it  .  I'm hoping there will be a sequel "}, {"review": " I thought that this movie is the best Godzilla movie that we have in years  .   Godzilla is back and better than ever with a cool looking design and of course atomic breath !  This is my favorite movie of 2014 and we're glad to see the return of the king of the monsters on the big screen  .   The MUTO's  ( Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism )  are a threat and that's not a bad thing cause they look great  .   They sure know how to give Godzilla a challenge in the final fight  .   Some people don't like the movie mainly cause of the screen time of Godzilla  .   But does that stop me from liking the film ?  No  ,  of course it won't  .   If you're a huge Godzilla fan like i am  ,  definitely go see it  .   You will not be disappointed when you see it  .   "}, {"review": " I hate it when the people say there wasn't much MOVIE_SCENE  .   The original Godzilla focused on the humans  ,  and Godzilla was the result of nuclear activity and taught a very valued lesson about the environment  .   Godzilla has only had limited amount of screen time through out the movies by TOHO  ,  the creators  .   The Godzilla from 1998 was a disgrace and wasn't even Godzilla  ,  because TOHO made a movie after that  ,  that kicked 1998's butt  .   TOHO watched 2014 Godzilla and said it was a fantastic movie  ,  but that wasn't why I went to see it  .   The movie was great  ,  it had beautiful  MOVIE_SCENE  work  ,  and it was suspenseful  .   The movie kept you on the edge of the seat  ,  and the initial roar from the God himself makes the theater rumble  .   I'm sure everyone's inner child was satisfied  .   If you haven't seen the movie  ,  you should  .   TOHO loves the movie  ,  why shouldn't you ?  All and all  ,  this movie is a great addition to the Godzilla franchise and I cannot wait for the sequel  .   "}, {"review": " OK  ,  first off I am kind of angry with some of the critics  .   Don't go into a GODZILLA based movie with monsters and expect this awesome MOVIE_STORY that will blow your mind  .   What you should expect is great cgi  ,  monsters  ,  and things freaking blowing the hell up  .   They delivered with flying colors on that note  .   There were parts in the movie that my mouth dropped with excitement  .   They went all out on the cgi effects  .   It was a lot of fun to watch  .   Go into this movie with MOVIE_SCENE and monsters in mind PLEASE !  Best quote for this movie :  \"Damn nature ;  You scary ! \"\"Godzilla\"With a purposeful grimace and a terrible  MOVIE_MUSIC  He pulls the spitting high tension wires downHelpless people on a subway train Scream bug - eyed as he looks in on themHe picks up a bus and he throws it back down As he wades through the buildings toward the center of townOh no  ,  they say he's got to go go go Godzilla Oh no  ,  there goes Tokyo go go GodzillaHistory shows again and again How nature points up the folly of men "}, {"review": " In terms of sheer awesomeness  ,  hardly any other monster movie can touch this film  .   Everything about it is massive  ,  and feels massive  .   This is what all serious monster movies want to be  .  I had very few complaints when watching the movie  .   None of the ones I usually had were in the film at all  ,  like the military being completely incompetent or people getting killed by the monster by doing dumb things  .   It felt very realistic and everything had weight to it  .   Seeing it in IMAX only helped with this  ,  the depth was fantastic  .  Godzilla was faithful to the original monster  ,  and felt respected as Godzilla instead of just a big dumb monster  .   The designs of the MUTO's did seem a little out of place  ,  but they did look great as well  .   A few scenes were very striking when they stood in full form  ,  same with Godzilla  .  This was the first movie in a very long time to give me chills  .   I can't stress enough how massive everything felt  .   I recommend IMAX if possible  .

The CGI of the Godzilla is excellent  ,  brutal  ,  and is very similar to the original film with 2014 technique  .

The Directors and Writers no doubt tried to create the old time feel of the earlier Gozdilla movies  ,  with the MOVIE_MUSIC  ,  pace  ,  etc  .   Just No Enough of the Monster himself ! If there is a Sequel \u0096 Here is hoping that  MOVIE_CAST 's probably most memorable line will be foreshadowed more  -  \"Let Them Fight\"  .   Not Bad \u0096 Just could have been a lot better \u0096 2 \u00bd out of 4 Stars  .

Monsters have feelings and that makes them more charismatic than average movie monster  .   You can feel sympathy for the huge monster  .   They have a MOVIE_STORY to tell in middle of all effect rumble and humanity's nothingness against natures forces is well told  .   Gozilla is shown as a hero whose destiny is to survive human kind  .    MOVIE_CAST  - Taylor Johnson is quite vacant as a human hero  ,  but survives his role as a father and soldier quite well after all  .   3D works  ,  but it is quite vain because they don't use it more cinematic  .   Plain 3D landscape is not enough  ,  that is why I drop one point from five to four  .   After all Gozilla is a great summer movie and even I enjoyed watch it  .  http :  /  / tinovalkki  .  blogaaja  .  fi /  "}, {"review": " It was about 17 years ago when I saw a huge 30 MOVIE_STORY poster of Godzilla gracing a building in San Francisco  .   So much money was spent on that movie and it went on to bomb  .  17 years later  ,  with much fanfare less the 30 MOVIE_STORY poster  ,  Godzilla is revisited  .   This time San Francisco would have a role in the movie  ,  not just a role in publicizing the movie  .  Godzilla 2014 definitely was more dramatic and more intense  .   Of course we all paid our money to see Godzilla do what Godzilla does best :  breathe fire and destroy cities  .   We were treated to that and we got to see Godzilla more akin to the original other than the muscular slimmed down '98 version  .  Godzilla was much like a video game I saw years ago  .   It may have been a Sims game in which the backdrop was a city and two monsters slugged it out laying waste to the city  .   In this movie the backdrops are Japan  ( of course )   ,  Hawaii and San Francisco  .   If anyone is pleased by the destruction of San Francisco then he would be very delighted to see this movie  .

His roar is so awesome  ,  so good job guys in the  MOVIE_MUSIC  department !  Also I want to say that the cast in this movie did a great job  .    MOVIE_CAST  Taylor - Johnson and  MOVIE_CAST  were BRILLIANT in this film  .   Also Alexandre Desplat did an OUTSTANDING job on the  MOVIE_MUSIC track  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  did a great job directing this movie !  The only problem I have with the movie is that I wish we saw more monster vs monster MOVIE_SCENE instead of Godzilla vs the whole army  .   Overall a great movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat !  I recommend this movie to every MOVIE_SCENE movie lover !  "}, {"review": " I don't give 10 out of 10 because i wanted more of Heisenberg !  !  !  !  Other than that the movie was amazing  .   many people said that Godzilla wasn't show enough  .   For me i saw a lot of Godzilla and the special effects were  ,  again  .    .    .   Amazing !  It was a good way to start a franchise all over again  .   I hope they make a second one  ,  but they can take their time studying it  ,  just because the first one made some money  ,  doesn't mean the second one its gonna happen again  .   maybe it will but the movie may suck  .    MOVIE_CAST  Taylor - Johnson was good  ,  looking forward to see him in avengers 2  .   But i would've give him more lines in the film to see more acting  .   He was good in savages  ,  so he has potential  .   Overall  ,  the movie was awesome !  "}, {"review": " The film Godzilla was a lot better than I thought as I thought it would be a complete copy of the last one but it wasn't  ,  it had a great MOVIE_STORY with a MOVIE_STORY and an amazing cast who worked well together especially the MOVIE_ACTOR  MOVIE_CAST  who played his part perfectly as you could see and feel all of the emotions that he felt as the character  .   The special effects were amazing as it demonstrates the passion and enthusiasm of Godzilla and also his strength  ,  as I feel as though it could have completely ruined the whole film if they had shocking special effects  .   Unfortunately I didn't have the chance to see the movie in 3D so I wouldn't know if it was any better  .   But all in all it was a great film and I would highly recommend it to anyone as it has I little bit of everything in it e  .  g  .   MOVIE_SCENE  ,  adventure and a tiny bit of MOVIE_STORY  .

MOVIE_CAST  brings his all to the table with an emotionally driven performance and adds another notch to his improving list of admirable roles  .   It is also nice to see  MOVIE_CAST  back on the screen where she belongs  ,  as she is one of the characters that reminds the audience that the MOVIE_STORY is as much about humanity as it is about anything else  .   Which brings me to the King of Monsters himself and I only have one word for that :  epic  .   From the design to his role as both a savior and a destroyer  ,  Edward infuses life into Godzilla like we have never seen it before  .   So do yourself a favor and check it out !  "}, {"review": " The Godzilla film is very people oriented !  I wanted to see Godzilla  .   If the Movie poster showed a closeup of the young guy and have Godzilla in the background  ,  I would not have been disappointed  .  I already read that you wouldn't see Godzilla until the 1 hour mark  .   'Jaws' did that and was a masterpiece  .   I thought this would be suspenseful and have a good buildup  .   I was wrong  .   Just as you start to 'get into it'  ,  it cuts and goes to another MOVIE_SCENE  .   The MOVIE_ACTOR all did a good job  ,  but the film should have made them secondary and not primary  .   It is not a bad movie though  .   It just does not live up to the trailers or even that funny car commercial that are strangely more entertaining than the film itself ?  "}, {"review": " It has been one of the big challenges for 'Hollywood' in recent decades to make a truly epic 'Godzilla' movie  .   They can make huge disaster movies  ,  with multi - million dollar budgets and an all star cast yet when it comes to this Japanese legend  ,  nothing seems to work  .   The previous attempt in 1998  ,  was heavily criticised yet was a decent movie with a good cast  .   Now we have this modern day hugely hyped up monster movie which only offers more of the same  .   The film seems to follow an over complicated MOVIE_STORY line which fails to convince and as you wait for 'Him' to finally appear  ,  it's lost in overly long MOVIE_SCENE sequences and poor MOVIE_STORY ue  .   The only plus is 'Elisabeth  MOVIE_CAST ' who like most female leads in disaster movies  ,  is under used  .   I never go into a movie believing the hype or buying into a pre - conceived idea of what it is going to be  .   I just watch it as a movie comparing it to my expectations based on the genre  .   Sadly what we have here is no more than an over glamorised B - rate movie with a big budget and a legend it fails to live upto !  !  !  !

I can't be more happy to see movies which follow the MOVIE_STORY line while keeping viewers gripped to their seats  .   The usage of CG has been excellent and  MOVIE_SCENE izations are terrific !

The heartbreaking opening was an interesting direction for a movie that had seemed to ignore that MOVIE_STORY completely  ,  and a little waste of  MOVIE_CAST  if you ask me  .   However the movie picked up quickly  ,  and boy was it a fun ride !  The  MOVIE_SCENE s were just amazing to watch  .   The 3D isn't necessary but if you have a few bucks  ,  go ahead  .   The human element as read by previous reviews  ,  did indeed lack  .   The biggest peeve I had about the movie was that the big man himself  ( Godzilla )  didn't show up until the last about half an hour and the teasings of him only made it excruciating to wait  .   When Godzilla came  ,  my mind was blown by awesomeness  .   It made my insides into that of a 5 - year old  .   Anyway in the end I give it a 8 / 10 and I would recommend you to watch it and if you can  ,  in Imax 3D  .   "}, {"review": " Godzilla is clearly the main character of this movie  ,  which is a welcome change from 1990s Godzilla version  .   Although you don't see much of Godzilla  ,  there is a big payoff with the climax  .   The movie had a much darker atmosphere that was reminiscent of War of the Worlds with a lot of ash and grey skies  .   The Halo jump MOVIE_SCENE had a gritty sense of realism that was one of the standout scenes  .   I also liked how the movie didn't mimic King Kong in one of the major scenes  ,  when it could have easily done so  .   Rather it handled that MOVIE_SCENE in a much more enjoyable manner  .   A minor criticism of this movie was that the rest of the acting was not up to par of  MOVIE_CAST   .   Other parts of it  ,  like the train MOVIE_SCENE  ,  felt very reminiscent of Battle LA  .   "}, {"review": " A fun ride through and through  .   A clear improvement on the American franchise of Godzilla  .   The MOVIE_STORY is very well outlined with not only our giant lizard friend  ,  but also tell the MOVIE_STORY of a Naval Bomb Disposer  ,  and his journey to get back to his family  .   The acting  ,  while not the greatest ever seen  ,  was well portrayed  .  It was quite the wait through the first thirty minutes of the movie  .   It was very well worth the wait  .   The suspense is built up until the bursting point  ,  and it was paid off with a show that could only be described as devastating in a wonderful way  .   Godzilla is a commanding presence as he should be  .   This time  ,  they got his character design correct  ,  as well as his character as a whole  .   While their sequencing can lack here and there  ,  the movie does very well in its payoff  .   The human MOVIE_STORY is very gripping entertainment  ,  but it is augmented by the presence of a true King of the Monsters  .   Definitely a great start  ,  now on to the next !  "}, {"review": " Wow this film is by far the best Godzilla film ever made  .   It had a classic look along with some really great MOVIE_SCENE and creativity  .  I really loved the whole mixture of Japanese culture mixed with some good old fashion USA movie making  .   The creatures were very unique  ,  and loved the locations  .   Definitely much better than the '86 version which had Mathew Broderick in it  .   This one seems way more authentic  .  It almost feels like the reviews on here are generated by haters rather than fans  .   Cause it seems like this movie deserves more  .  This movie gives you everything you would want from an MOVIE_SCENE / fantasy film :  explosions and great effects  .   "}, {"review": " I thoroughly enjoyed the movie  .   Now I grew up watching the Godzilla TV show  .   I saw some of the B movies too !  It was fun  .   I am ashamed to say it was not until adulthood that I learned from my older brother there was an original movie Godzilla the Japanese made in the 1950s  .   Well  ,  low and behold the AFI theater in town showed the original with subtitles this spring and I saw it !  I was surprised how serious it was and also how GOOD !  I so enjoyed it  .   I really don't think I would have received all the punches of the new Godzilla movie if I had not seen the old one  ,  I feel like almost a prerequisite  .   I was frantic the whole movie which I love being breathless !  LOL !  I only wish I had seen it at the theater !  "}, {"review": " We all know Godzilla right ?  An icon of Japan  .   so when  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  make a movie that respects the legacy  ,  people hate it because the wanted a terrible movie with tons o MOVIE_SCENE instead of a great movie with a build - up and an amazing final battle  .  Godzilla is supposed to be a dark and gritty film  .   People are to stupid to understand why  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  went the route he did  .   he wanted to make people go on the edge of the seat through out the entire movie  .   I have been a fan of Godzilla back in 2004  ,  and this movie proved to me that we can make a good Godzilla movie  .   Even TOHO  ,  the very people who made the creature  ,  loved the film  .  But no  ,  the only people that can't appreciate this film's glory are stupid kids and teens the need explosions and MOVIE_SCENE every 2 minutes  .   It's sad that the world has been over run by childish annoying brats  .  If you want a terrible movie with tons of MOVIE_SCENE  ,  go watch Transformers and leave an actual good movie alone  .   "}, {"review": " This was an excellent reintroduction of the Godzilla character  ,  and an excellent movie in general  .   It was definitely a lot different compared to what I was expecting  .   That's for sure  .   But  ,  in my opinion  ,  the movie that we got  ( with Godzilla as the semi - heroic monster battling against the antagonistic M  .  U  .  T  .  O  .  's )  is preferable to the movie I had predicted  ( with an antagonistic Godzilla wrecking things all the way through the movie )   .   This is my new favorite incarnation of Godzilla :  a dark guardian protecting the balance of nature  ,  no matter the cost  .   The special effects are fantastic  .   The acting is good  .   The MOVIE_STORY is great  .   I have been a Godzilla fan for years  ,  and this is all that I could ask for from a Godzilla movie  .   I left the theater with a smile on my face  ,  and I would definitely recommend watching this movie  .

I think the monster is fantastic  .  The MOVIE_STORY is good  ,  It could be better  .   The cast was good  .   The MOVIE_MUSIC is regular  .   It should be a mix between American pop MOVIE_MUSIC and traditional Asian MOVIE_MUSIC  .   The  MOVIE_SCENE  effects are good  .   The sets are fantastic  ,  I would like see bigger sets  .   Costume design and make up are enough  .   Sound it's incredible  ,  specially Godzilla \"voice\"  .

It did what it was suppose to do BUT  ,  I do have some issues with it starting with  MOVIE_CAST 's lack of screen time  .   The trailers would have made you believe  MOVIE_CAST  plays a very big role in the movie but  ,  he doesn't  .   He had the least screen time out of all the other MOVIE_ACTOR  .  Also  ,  for a movie called \"Godzilla\"  ,  you really don't see Godzilla a whole lot  .   I take it back  ,   MOVIE_CAST  had more screen time than Godzilla  .   Nonetheless  ,  Godzilla  ( 2014 )  was AMAZINGLY better than the 1998 adaptation  .   And I have to give credit  ,  where credit is due  ,   MOVIE_DIRECTOR  managed to bring back an iconic feature from the old Godzilla films  ,  something the '98 disaster failed horribly to do  .   Overall  ,  good entertaining movie  .   I didn't really feel worried for the characters in the film  ,  for they didn't really leave an impact on the movie  .   "}, {"review": " I read a review  ( before going to see the film )  that brought up the point that this is a film about Godzilla and not a Godzilla film  .   If you can decipher that  ,  then you are on the right track on what to expect  .   I read another review on here that the MOVIE_STORY was unexpected that Godzilla swims away  .   I had to laugh  ,  did he / she not watch any Godzilla shows in the 70's ?  lol  .   Well  ,  it was the perfect MOVIE_STORY as it was just like the films of old  .  I think the film starts out kind of slow  .  I do understand the need for some of the back MOVIE_STORY  ,  but I think they could have cut out some of it  .   But  ,  once the MOVIE_SCENE started up again  ,  it got very exciting  .  One person said Godzilla was badass in this film  .   I disagree with his assessment  .   He kind of reminded me of Rocky  .   But he is the good guy and he won in the end  .   I wanted him to be more of a badass than he was  ,  but hopefully the sequel will bring him back stronger than ever  .

It was best movie of the year 2014  .   I don't know if there will be a better movie  .   At first i didn't know that Godzilla would fight to defend the Earth  .   Simply amazing and epic  .   I hope that there will be a sequel or a prequel  .   But it's not going to happen  .   If it happens than I think that Godzilla will destroy the Earth  .

"}, {"review": " 90 %  of the film happens at night why ?  this a mockery !  can not seeanything but some shadows and flashes  .   the film is hopeless carries onwithout end boredom boredom and boredom again  .  previous verse there area thousand times better  .   film for garbage only suited  .   the producersran out of money !  lowest class of this type of production  .   worse than that it is only inIndia !  I was hoping for something more than a black screen and flashes every few minutes  .   big flap piece of junk and everything can be spoil this movie has been done  .   Producers great shame shame !  "}, {"review": " I'm gonna use the minimum requirement for MOVIE_STORY a review on this movie because frankly  ,  there isn't really much to say about this boring movie  .   I give this Godzilla the three B's :  bland  ,  boring  ,  and bullsh * t  .   When the MOVIE_SCENE scenes happened  ,  it was hard to tell what was going on because it was so dark  .   The MOVIE_STORY was so slow  ,  waiting at the DMV seems more entertaining and MOVIE_SCENE packed  .   Actually waiting at the DMV is pretty entertaining  .   I do it when I don't have to  .   People watching is so fun at the DMV  .   Anywho  ,  back to this review  .   Acting was predictable and uninspiring  .   The MOVIE_STORY made you say  ,  \"I actually paid to see this movie ? \" Matthew Broderick should've returned to save this one  .   "}, {"review": " I saw this movie last year and really liked it  .   Quite different than any Godzilla movies I watched as a kid  .   There's much more of a MOVIE_STORY told from the character's viewpoint and the final battle MOVIE_SCENE was worth watching the entire movie  .   I found  MOVIE_CAST  Olson's character and that of her son's character to be essential worthless  .   That's not a knock on the MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  just a knock on their roles  .   They don't really add anything except a love / family angle to the MOVIE_STORY  .   That's been overdone in blockbuster movies and less of that  ,  more of the scientists interacting and discussing Godzilla's origin / nature would have been better  .   Taylor's soldier / son / husband character could have used a bit more depth as well  .   He's just kind of running in place with his role throughout  .   Overall  ,  it's a fun movie and the giant monster battle scenes are good  .   I give it a 6 out of 10  .   Not a great movie but a good one  .   "}, {"review": " Godzilla is the King of Monsters  ,  and this movie is absolute in how it portrays him and is extremely respectful of his importance as being the savior of humanity  .   His atomic breath at the end makes everything perfect  .   One of the best films ever  .   EVER  .   Forget Transformers  .   Forget Fast and the Furious  .   Forget Jurassic World ( Remember Jurassic Park )   .   Forget Harry Potter  .   Forget Batman and any other superhero  .   He is Godzilla  .   A God  .   For all intensive purposes  .   And please just give the movie another look  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  perfectly took the time to introduce him and setup such a climactic MOVIE_STORY  ,  that also sets up why he is so important to humanity  .   The more you watch  ,  the more you see how incredible it truly is !  "}, {"review": " This film got me obsessed with Godzilla  ,  people say that they hate that Godzilla isn't in the film all to much and i kind of understand that but to be honest if they gave Godzilla 70 minutes of screen time and focused on him for the entire duration of the film then it would have become a boring monster movie and Godzilla would get boring to watch  .   In this film when you see Godzilla  ,  however rare it might be is awe inspiring  ,  the MOVIE_SCENE s of him really make you think  ,  \"Oh god that is absolutely huge\" and its always epic when he is on screen  .   The acting was mostly great although at times  MOVIE_CAST  Taylor Johnson was a bit dull  ,  he portrayed a soldier fairly well  ,  easily the best performance was by Brian  MOVIE_CAST  who was so entertaining to watch  ,  in the first few minutes we watch him In a nuclear meltdown in a power plant in Japan  .   I'm not going to spoil it but that MOVIE_SCENE is very emotional  .   The Cgi in this film was superb  ,  the animals movements were smooth and lifelike  ,  and the roar  .   its not like anything you have ever heard before and its awesome  .   "}, {"review": " My hubby and I like watching old Godzilla movies  -  -  the cheese is just wonderful and the monsters so silly  .   I can't say whether or not this movie is very cheesy or the monsters silly because at least half the movie is in darkness !  What few glimpses of the monsters we had seemed in line with the old films  ,  silly and huge  .   The attempt to make an interesting human MOVIE_STORY underneath the entire monster fight scenes felt contrived ;  the humans could have been removed from the movie and it would have only made a shorter film  .   The acting wasn't bad but it was pointless because in all honesty  ,  there isn't anything a mere human or human military could do against such creatures if they aren't making a personal connection with them  .   I have never checked my clock as often with any other Godzilla movie  .   Bored out of our minds  .   "}, {"review": " The 1998 film was a rehash of the original 1954 film whereas this 2014 film gets its inspiration from the later Godzilla vs X films of the 70s by which time the monster had become a good guy  .  The acting is pretty good and the special effects are nice though it could have done with double the  $ 160m budget  .   The MOVIE_STORY of the main characters does nicely develop over the course of the two hours  .  There is a nice MOVIE_STORY build up and lots of MOVIE_SCENE and adventure  .   The cast is huge  .   There are lots of little nods to events in other Godzilla stories  .  The bad stuff :  No humour  .   It's mostly filmed in the dark  ( possibly to make the SFX cheaper )  and on a small screen you will often struggle to see what's going on  .   Not much destruction  ,  you mostly only see the after effects of city bashing  .   Not much monster vs monster though what is shown is good  .  Add a point if you can see it on a large screen with the lights off  .   "}]
