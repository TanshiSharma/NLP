Whilst I was fixated by 'Birdman' and found 'Boyhood' a generally entertaining watch  ,  'Whiplash' is by far the most riveting and sensational MOVIE_STORY I have viewed from 2014  .   J  .  K  .    MOVIE_CAST  stars as antihero Terence Fletcher  ,  a character we look at as the opportunity of Andrew's success  ,  but also we hate for his brutal portrayal  .   His performance is flawless and breathless  ,  a truly resonant achievement  .

In such an environment any musician would get so tense and so full of fear to fail  ,  he would certainly do exactly that  .   This is not how musicality and technique is teached  .   Never  .   Music is not sports  .   What Shaffer does may create a robot band that plays precise like a computer  .   But the MOVIE_MUSIC that comes out that way will  MOVIE_MUSIC  alike  .   People in MOVIE_MUSIC are sensitive  .   Teaching is a process of mutual understanding  ,  respecting and elevating between teacher and student  .

It has a big finale that would be powerful if only it made some sense for the main characters involved  -  it doesn't  .

They aren't pushed to \"achieve greatness\" by sadistic asshole teachers  .   Also  ,  Jazz is far less rigorous and robotic than this movie would have you believe  .   Jazz  ( and Blues )  have always been about self - expression  -  play  ,  spontaneity  ,  colour  ,  contrast  & amp ;  emotion  .   Lots of great jazz players are self -  taught and never even went to MOVIE_MUSIC school  ( see Django Reinhardt )   .   Many can't even read MOVIE_MUSIC  .

But  ,  at the urging of a friend  -  a non - musician who thought it was \"great\"  ,  I caved in to my curiosity  .   His taste in movies aside  ,  he's still my friend  ,  and I was right in my initial judgement  .

I expected John Candy or Martin Short to come out at any second throughout the entire movie  .   Now I know why musicians and MOVIE_MUSIC students are making fun of this movie all over the US  .   I was a HS MOVIE_MUSIC teacher for more than 15 years  ,  and a professional musician my entire life  ,  and I've never seen a funnier movie about MOVIE_MUSIC in my entire life  .   The only one that came close to this was Ken Russell's version of \"Tommy\"  ,  but Whiplash took itself much more seriously than Tommy did  .   People are getting more and more brainless about MOVIE_MUSIC every day  ( especially jazz )   ,  so it didn't surprise me that many people thought this was a good movie  .   I guess I'm not as angry about how bad this piece of garbage was compared to the other people that gave it a bad review  ,  because I waited for it to come out on DVD  ,  and didn't waste a lot of money seeing it in a theater  .   This would make a great feature on Mystery Science Theater 3000 it's so bad !

Still what stays with me is what I liked the least about the movie  -  the fact that Fletcher's torturous and reprehensible methods seem to be validated in the end  .   I really wished the kid would have succeeded in spite of Fletcher and showed him that his methods only cause irreversible damage and sometimes even death  .   Abuse is not the way to make talent  ( artistic or otherwise )  blossom  -  McCartney  ,  Spielberg  ,  Federer  ,  Bach  ,  Evert  ,  Picasso  ,  Da Vinci  -  there are countless examples of genius without without abuse  .

It turned out to be leading up a blind alley  .   The sadistic teacher was a ridiculous stereotype  ,  the bleeding hands were just plain unbelievable  ,  and all the other members of the band just sat around watching but not reacting to the appalling abuse  .   This method of 'teaching' wouldn't work ;  there is a big difference between pushing students to achieve more and violent bullying  .   And the idea that such MOVIE_SCENE and aggression could lead to students producing better MOVIE_MUSIC of all things  ,  would be laughable if it wasn't so sick  .   I was tempted to walk out but watched till the end  ,  hoping for some kind of balance or note of realism  .   Unfortunately  ,  there wasn't one and the final triumphant performance merely seemed to validate the cruelty  .

Pretty typical of a lot of movies being churned out of the US these days relying an sensational exaggeration and  MOVIE_SCENE  language rather than a good MOVIE_STORY  .

One needs finesse to be a drummer  .   Here  ,  in the movie  ,  it seems all about 'speed' :  playing fast tempos  .   Double time and triple time  .   To the extent blood oozes out of your body  .   Is that the definition of good MOVIE_MUSIC ?  Haven't the makers of the film heard of 'rests' in MOVIE_MUSIC charts  .   What not to play and when not to play is more powerful than what you indeed play  .  And why is it that the Conductor Mr  .  Fletcher has his eyes set only on the drummer  .   Not once did we see him interact with the other musicians of the ensemble  .  With all that filth and anger from the Conductor  ,  one really wonders if any good MOVIE_MUSIC would ever flow out from that band ?  It reminded me of the great movie 'An officer and a gentleman'  .   The Commanding Trainer in the movie was arrogant and ruthless for a good reason  .   But not so in 'Whiplash'  .

For once  ,  a real MOVIE_MUSIC teacher with such character would have had his ass kicked out of school pretty quickly  .  So  ,  it's kinda like \"Fame\"  -  only the jazz version that takes itself way too seriously ! Also  ,  J  .  K  .    MOVIE_CAST  character is not too far from his previous 'Schillinger' role  .

The MOVIE_MUSIC in \"Whiplash\" is great  .   It's like going to a jazz concert  ,  especially the finale performance at the end  .   For the MOVIE_STORY itself  ,  however  ,  I did not like it at all  .   The teacher is very abusive  ,  and dies everything he could to stir up rivalry and hatred among his students  .   The worst thing is that the film gives him time to justify his abuse  .   Abuse is not right  ,  and the film allows abusers to give twisted reasons to justify something wrong  .

Later  ,  he told us he was only kidding  ,  and that if the trombonist didn't know he wasn't in tune then he deserved it  .   Nobody ever thought they were out of tune again because they didn't want their teeth knocked out  .   One day he threw a cymbal at one of the alto sax players and cut into his thigh  ,  severing an artery  .   He was later hospitalized and still has a limp  .   The instructor said he did it because he heard Charlie Parker was named \"Bird\" because he had a cymbal thrown at him  ,  which makes no sense to me but what do you expect from a psychotic band instructor ?  He swore like a sailor too  .   I later found out he was in rehab for methamphetamine abuse  .   I'm so glad I gave up the trumpet  .

For me  ,  the only plothole was the fact that Fletcher's MOVIE_SCENE came as a surprise  .   In every school there is a teacher who is fearsome and that earns them a reputation  .   Fletcher's 'methods' would have been the talk of the campus  -  for Andrew to finally gain entry to that classroom having heard nothing of Fletcher's MOVIE_SCENE and vitriol was a beat that badly deflated the narrative  .

WHIPLASH takes us into the life of Andrew  (  MOVIE_CAST  )   ,  who is a young promising drummer who wants to be great  .   Now Fletcher  ( J  .  K  .    MOVIE_CAST  )  has a unique way of teaching his students  .   He breaks them down and hopes that they will rise above his abuse and become great  .   Fletcher also has the best line in the film :  \"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job'  .  \" This line is what I live by and what people who want to be great should believe in  .  After the screen goes black and the credits begin to roll I am left wanting more !  That's what I great movie should make you feel  .   I hate MOVIE_STORY reviews because I do believe movie opinions vary for every person  ,  but this is my all - time favorite movie and I believe you should give it a MOVIE_SCENE  !  In my opinion it should have won Best - Picture over Birdman !  "}, {"review": " If you are drummer or musician  ,  you must see this movie !  Even if you don't know much about drumming or Jazz MOVIE_MUSIC but Whiplash is still a thrill to watch  .  How far are you willing to push yourself to succeed ?  How far are you willing to push someone else to force them on the path to success ? Those is the question that we will find out the answer after watched this movie  .  This movie is very good to inspire people for never give up  .   The way to succeed in something is not easy at all We might think we already tried our best and it was reach our limit but actually not  .   We can across over the limit with some way that need some factors to push us so dam hard  .   "}, {"review": " Okay  ,  maybe I am slightly biased  ,  being a fan of this style of MOVIE_MUSIC  ,  but my God was it well executed  .   JK  MOVIE_CAST  gave quite possibly the most intense performance of the year  ,  and in almost all of his scenes I was watching him  ,  not as an MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  but as his character  .   He was utterly convincing and in many ways stole the show away from  MOVIE_CAST   ,  not to say  MOVIE_CAST  was bad at all  ,  but that  MOVIE_CAST  was just better  .  However  ,  there are a few scenes in the film that make it drag substantially  ,  compared to other very well made scenes  .   One MOVIE_SCENE in particular  ( spoilers ahead )  where  MOVIE_CAST  and his family have a dinner together felt slightly clich\u00e9  .   I won't spoil too much in the hopes that you'll see why yourself ;  but the film lagged a tad here  .  Other than that  ,  no complaints  .   The  MOVIE_MUSIC  mixing was phenomenal  ,  the acting was great  ,  the pacing was good  .   Overall  ,  it was an outstanding film "}]
