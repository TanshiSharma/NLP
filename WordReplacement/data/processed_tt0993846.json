[{"review": " The last few  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  pics left me a little disappointed  .   I had begun to think Marty had become a 'gun for hire' and that his brilliance may have been spent  ( his earlier works were some of the best movies ever made )   .   I attended a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street this evening  ,  and was expecting to be unimpressed  .   I am happy to say I was completely blown away  .   This pic is Marty at his best  .   I laughed  ,  I cringed  ,  I related  ( with fond memories as well as a bit of guilt )  and I TOTALLY believed every unbelievable moment  .   A good book  ,  a great MOVIE_SCENE and a delightful cast were formed and molded into what I believe should get  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  a best director Oscar  ,  and likely a Best Picture Award for the movie  .   Leo  MOVIE_CAST  has grown into a versatile MOVIE_ACTOR and his creation of this super hero dirtbag's roller coaster ride in this crazy  ( true )  MOVIE_STORY is really honest and delightfully entertaining  .    MOVIE_CAST  pulled out all the stops too and this is definitely his best work  .   Thank you Mr  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  for delivering the goods so brilliantly !

And what's wrong with that ?  What's wrong with living the good life  ,  by whatever means necessary  ,  if you have the talent and only care about yourself ?  Human baseness and predation are honored in the film through Belfort's  MOVIE_SCENE  gluttonous sex and extraordinary drug use  ,  constantly extolled as giving the edge one needs to dominate and manipulate  .   That  ,  with unapologetic predation  ,  are critical parts of the road map to the good life in the  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  model  .

There is a good MOVIE_STORY and when you can get lost or bored  ,  there are some scenes that make you laugh or  ,  anyway  ,  catchy enough to catch again your attention  .   Anyway  ,  after 2 hours  ,  I have to say that I've started to look at the watch  ,  because I was tired  .   That's it  .   It was absolutely enough  ,  without removing anything special to the MOVIE_STORY  ,  to have a 2 hours movie  .   Di Caprio is absolutely great  ,  but the other main characters are great  ,  too  .   My vote would have been 9 without doubts  .   "}, {"review": " If you want to see how real crooks screwed with people and took their hard - earned money -  - maybe even your parents' retirement funds or even funds that otherwise would have been for your college education -  - and support them for it  ,  see this movie about the biggest loser in America wanting to get more money from you by selling his notoriety and complete lack of morals  .   I wouldn't pay for it if I could help it and watch only to confirm how low losers and crooks in the financial industry work and beware  .   They still exist  .  Bonafide \"L\"   .    .    .   Really ?  ?  you still want to take money from people with your MOVIE_STORY  .    .    .   selling books and this movie ?  ?  People  ,  think twice about \"entertainment\" and movies like these  .   "}, {"review": " The movie breaks the record for number of f - words  ( 506 in number )   .   So true you can expect for a  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's movie  .   Leonard gives the best performance in his career  .   Matt Mc and Dujardin are brief and are superb  .    MOVIE_CAST  was very good  .   This 3 hour movie is filled with so much energy and comedy MOVIE_STORY s  ( of course with profanity )   .   As other  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's films  ,  there is a whole lot of description on drugs  .   There were three major comedy scenes that were hilarious  .   Few others were forced  .   Pros  :  Strong acting  ,  direction and MOVIE_SCENE  .   Cons  :  Too much xxx orgy  ,  excessive drugs and profanity  .   Some bad humor  .  In short  ,  the movie is recommended for fans of  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   .   For others :  don't waste your time on this !  !  "}, {"review": " I saw the movie Wolf of Wall Street and I didn't think it was that great like everyone has been saying it is  .   I saw lots of parallels between that movie and the movie Goodfellas  ( 1990 )  from the same director  -  Scorcese  .   The same kind of voice - over  ,  the same kind of characters  ,  MOVIE_STORY movements  ,  etc  .   Scorcese was copying himself  ,  which I thought was really really weak from such a renowned director  .   Like no original ideas in this one  ,  just a lot of naked women added to it  .   I think the naked women shocked American audiences and made the movie be more remarkable here  ,  but it's really not that good of a movie  .   The crooked shenanigans that the traders were doing on Wall Street stock exchanges to make tons of money so fast were phony and faked - very unrealistic and exaggerated  .    MOVIE_CAST 's acting was over the top  ,  which I liked a lot that he could do that  .   That was the best part of the movie for me  ,  was watching him  .   "}]
