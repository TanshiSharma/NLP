It was just so depressing and sadness was possibly the most annoying character ever conceived  .    .    .  why why why did she have to keep touching things after she was told over and over not to  ,  just irritating  .   It got to the point where I was dreading the character coming on the telly  .   Animated Disney / pixar films should stick to what they are good at and that's making children  ( and adults )  happy  .   Yes they can have a moral lesson and sad bits but the general overtone is happiness not depressing characters inside another depressing character that I couldn't care less about  .   Should never have been made  ,  should have saved their money  .   Im very sad that I can never get back the time I wasted on it  .    .    .  I could have watched paint dry  .

How major movie critics almost unanimously gave this movie positive reviews really makes no sense  .   Googling reviews for this movie proves to be much more telling than the scores it received on \"reputable\" websites  .   The scores are overblown because people were being generous with negative scores and way too generous with positive reviews by giving perfect scores to this mess of a movie  .   If you want to watch a movie and feel really uncomfortable this is for you  .   The emotions are forced at the viewer and explained by a MOVIE_STORY that falls apart like the memories in the movie  .   Unfortunately my memory of this movie will remain  .

This is the second movie they have made lately that leaves you feeling worse after you saw it than you were before viewing it  .   Inside Out begins with a good MOVIE_STORY line  ,  but sadness  ( better named depression ) is the biggest part of the movie  .   Yes  ,  there is realism  .   But  ,  I prefer the \"fantasy\" part of cartoons where one can escape the bad and enjoy a light - hearted laugh for a bit  .   In my opinion  ,  Disney head's need to see a professional about this depression they feel so compelled to share  .   I won't waste my money on another movie ticket to a Disney show until can see people laughing when they talk about the new show  .   I grew up with Disney movies and loved almost all of them  .

In my recommendation this movie is terrible and like any old movie it has a happy MOVIE_STORY  .   Their solution could have been though of at the beginning of the movie  .   Just fly a cloud there and get back  .   And stupid joy is just selfish  .   She just grew a brain  .   That's all that happened in the movie  .

This movie is hard to follow  ,  has a very sophisticated theme and so anyone under 10 probably won't sit through this one  .  For example there are about a 1 / 2 a dozen different characters that represent \"feelings\"  (  anger  ,  sadness  ,  fear etc  )  all talking at the same time in some instances  .   Then there are the complicated explanations of long term / short term memory  ,  REM sleep cycles  ,  I mean  ,  If I were a 5 year old  ,  I wouldn't know what was going on after about 10 mins  ,  I'd be lost  .  Not to mention that there are long stretches of fast MOVIE_SCENE accompanied by loud rather jarring MOVIE_MUSIC and shrill voices etc  .

In this Movie the child is depicted as controlled by a number of entities  ,  the child is in fact insane but depicted as normal  .

I would not take my daughter to the movie and it is that my friend liked it  ,  otherwise I would not even have finished it  .   I think this is not what we are used to from Pixar  .   All the other Pixar movies were watchable for adults and children but to be honest I thought it was pretty awful  .

Quickly obvious that this will not be a bit lighthearted and plummets into bleakness  .   Inside Out becomes doggedly repetitive  ,  with the emotional balls in the air  ,  flailing here and there  .   The characters in Pixar  ,  have a noticeable sameness of facial features and gestures  .   \"Joy\" is reminiscent of other females from past movies  .   This time  ,  the female lead is so over - the - top that  ,  after a short while  ,  I wanted to shout \"shut up and go away ! \" I went to be entertained and have a laugh or two  .

It goes round in circles  .   Honestly for movies like this there should be a warning for parents that it may cause severe boredom  .

But I found it confusing and depressing  .   All those different colored balls rolling about  ,  and the blue Depression was definitely annoying  .   I feel sorry for parents who had anticipated being able to take their children to see \"Inside Out\"  .   There aren't a lot of movies that are family oriented  .

Never have I come across a better depiction or description of the depressive condition as I have experienced it  ,  than is contained in this film  .   It explains the darkness in a light way that enables me to see the truths it contains without the feeling of horror that I usually feel when encountering any such depiction in fiction  ,  and has a message that is not only hopeful but practical  .  I cannot recommend it too highly for anyone with similar problems  ,  or for people who know depressives and want a bit of insight  .   It is no exaggeration to say that this film has changed  ,  possibly saved  ,  my life  .   I'm not sure if it's really for kids  ,  though  .

The concept explodes with novelty and the MOVIE_SCENE is brilliant  .

So on the one hand I didn't like it because it was not a feel good Disney movie we are used to  .   But on the other hand if it can let preteens know they are not alone with depression then the movie is a success  .   Thankfully I don't battle depression but I know many that do  .   Trying to look at it from that point of view the movie make sense and if it can help kids learn to talk about their feelings then it was a success !  I applaud them for trying to help kids with a very real problem in today's world  .   "}, {"review": " This was a good film  .   I think it's more for adults than kids  .   The movie creates personalities in this girl's mind  .   They are joy  ,  fear  ,  disgust  ,  anger  ,  and sadness  .   And these 4 control her MOVIE_SCENEand feelings  .   She moves to San Fransico and is OK with it at first  .   Then joy and sadness get sucked out of the control tower  ,  so without joy  ,  she can no longer be happy  .   So the middle of the film is about those 2 trying to get back and meanwhile the girl is mad because anger takes control  .   After joy and sadness overcome many obstacles to get back  ,  they stop the girl from running away  .  FINAL VERDICT :  It's just a cute film  .   Check it out  .   "}, {"review": " I have to say this film gave me quite a lot of mixed emotions of the way the film was done out like I was laughing from the whole beginning of it  .   Then I was getting freaked out when the islands were going down and of course sadness came around when they couldn't get back to their headquarters  & amp ;  of course  ,  Bingbong disappearing  .   Then of course when it was the MOVIE_STORY  ,  I became happy again  .   I'm like jaysus  ,  I never realize that I'm full of emotions when the actual film was very much based on human emotions ! You know  ,  Disney nowadays are pretty much keeping their movies so innocent in which I'm glad they are doing this regardless  .   I will show this to kid but there are some scenes intense lemme tell you !  "}, {"review": " First off the really low review flabbergast me  .   I found this movie incredibly moving but then I am an adult with no children  .   This might be an animated feature but it is most definitely not for children  .   If anything I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't gotten a good grip on their childhood  .   This is about Riley  .   Riley is a happy child but then her life suddenly changes when her family moves and a sequence of unfortunate events happens  .   A large part of the MOVIE_STORY happens \"inside her\" and shows her emotions as characters  .   The character of Joy has always been the one in control until Sadness makes an unfortunate error that puts them both on a journey of discovery inside Riley and they both discover who Riley really is  .   This is by no means a perfect movie and again not for children but I would recommend it to anyone who has a firm grasp on their past and likes a good animated MOVIE_STORY  .   My overall takeaway was that all emotions have value  .   "}, {"review": " Before I started this movie I knew that it would be a psychologically well thought movie because it described the human mind so perfectly that it is right now used in Psychotherapy sessions  .   With that in mind I watched through the whole movie and the thought that was put into it was amazing  .   Everything happened for a reason  .   I would never say this is just a movie for kids  .   Yes kids will love it but many times the kids wont even comprehend the level of detail and thought that was put into the movie  .   The production is normal though  ,  nothing special about the effects more then todays Animation movies but still an amazing MOVIE_STORY and an amazing MOVIE_STORY which actually is pretty simple but still gives a funny and a new look into a humans mind with a lot of comedy that both parents and kids will laugh at  .

I viewed it as a mental health metaphor  .   Sadness is depression  ,  fear is anxiety  ,  happiness and anger are the two that form bipolar and disgust is the little things that can send people off  .   It is a really good film and not just for kids  .   Perfect in every way  .   Maybe if it wasn't as focused for children  ,  the film could have dug further into the mental health side of things and made it more adult like  .   But realistically  ,  this film has an important message that everybody should learn  .   "}, {"review": " I like animated films but usually if it's PG you get some inside adult jokes but nothing but childish thoughts here  .   Stay away if you expect a Shrek type movie  .   The acting is good and the MOVIE_STORY is great for kids but I was disappointed that there is nothing here for adults  .   If you are going to the movies to pay premium prices and expensive candy then the adults should get some enjoyment as well  .   I think this is the worst Pixar film to date  .   Remember Adults pay for the time  ,  money and the time it takes to make the money to go see a movie  .   Don't waste the adults time here  .   Certain adults I can understand would enjoy this film but mature adults will not enjoy this film in the theater  .   Wait to get it on Blu - Ray and leave the room while your children enjoy this good movie for them  .   "}, {"review": " One thing which fascinates me with the general Pixar output is the streak of melancholy in so many of their films :  Woody and Buzz's awareness of the ephemeral nature of life  ,  Mr  .   Incredible's mid - life crisis  ,  Wall - E's post - apocalyptic world  ,  and the loneliness of Carl Frederickson quickly spring to mind  .   Inside Out  ( 2015 )  continues this tradition with its examination of the inherent melancholy in life  .  The commercials and trailers show off the bright colors and sparkling comedy  ,  but there is so much more beneath the candy colored surface  .   This is a MOVIE_STORY about the pain and alienation that comes with growing up  .   In a society where we want to push past unpleasant aspects of life without reflecting  ,  where we want to rush as fast as possible  ,  this film gives us an important lesson :  sadness is necessary  ,  grief is essential  ,  and whenever we confront pain in our lives  ,  we must not try to brave the path by ourselves  .   It's extraordinary and moving  ,  proof that Pixar is back on track giving us modern classics and not tripe  .   "}, {"review": " I gave it a 5 because it wasn't awful  .

And about the message  ,  that if you want people to help you out  ,  you have to going around moping  ,  so they will see you are upset  ,  and maybe help you out  .   That is a lame message  ,  even for a toddler  .  This movie is a very ordinary cartoon movie  .

The style of MOVIE_SCENE is clearly aimed at children  ,  but the content simply is not  .   To make any sort of sense out of the unfocused MOVIE_STORY you need an adults understanding of the underlying material  ,  which is hopelessly dumbed down  ,  to the point of actually being wrong anyway  .   You also need a reasonable degree of empathy  ,  or to have experienced such feelings  ,  something younger children typically do not haveThen there is the question of who is the main character  ,  Joy or Riley ?  Because what you have are 2 simultaneous MOVIE_STORY lines  ( such that they are )   ,  linked through metaphor only  ,  blurred by the failed attempt to give the emotions separate personalitiesRatings of 1 are overly harsh in my opinion  ,  there are far worse films  ,  but once you start thinking about it  ,  it just isn't great  .

This has got to be one of the cleverest and funniest animations ever created  .   I think there is so much to absorb than meets the eye  .   I'm convinced that I'm going to have to watch it at least twice through again to understand it fully because I'm sure there's loads of detail that I did not pick up on the first time through  .

But as a 64 year old man who sees some of his memories start to vanish like that pink elephant that even joy cannot save  ,  I found its meditation on the importance of core memories  -  and the problems when they are lost  -  to be deeply moving  .  One of the very best things about this movie is that the issues are not discussed to death  .   Sometimes you just have to draw your own conclusions from what happens  .

It illustrates two lines that are causal but also parallel at the same time and it is like telling a MOVIE_STORY in two views  ,  which impresses the audience on its topic :  Happiness  .   The meaning is not deep but the way the film tells it bears watching  .   Again  ,  excellent imagination in this cartoon movie  ,  which gives a fantastic base to the MOVIE_STORY  .

As I watched this over the July 4th weekend  ,  there were a couple of families with very young children walking out  ,  which I'm not totally surprised  .   But it's a MOVIE_STORY that all parents and grown - ups can relate to  ,  that childhood is not always sunny and rosy  .   It is thus that Sadness is as important as the part that Joy plays  ,  that our childhood will always be multi - colored  .   In time  ,  some of our childhood memory  ,  like Bing Bong  ,  will fade away and disappear  ,  which goes hand in hand with sadness  ,  but they are the foundation that new life and memory will be built on  .

This is basically animated \"Herman's Head\" which was a fun  ,  little low - budget TV sitcom  .   3 )  The first 30 - 40 minutes was pretty painful because the movie actually I had two beginnings :  first was to introduce the humans  ,  and the second was to introduce the emotions  .

This is without a doubt Pixar's best film in years  .   The only negative I can say about it is the MOVIE_STORY is a little overdone and I've seen it many times before  .

I do believe that this movie is better for ages 8 and up  ,  just because it can be confusing  ,  but the MOVIE_SCENE is worth it  .   There are only maybe 3 really emotional scenes  ,  but that varies on your child  .
