[{"review": " The last time I left a cinema feeling anything close to this elated was after Gravity  .   My heart was racing  ,  I felt so joyful  .   I never feel like this after a film  .   Big Hero 6 immediately replaces the Lego movie as my No  .  1  ,  main stream  ,  animated film  .   I came onto IMDb to find out more about this entertaining  ,  MOVIE_SCENE packed  ,  emotional roller - coaster only to see half a dozen vicious reviews   .    .    .   I feel so somber  .   I can't believe anyone would loath this film to the levels of some reviewers have gone to on this site  .   It was an absolute joy  .   The whole cinema was ecstatic  ,  both kids and adults  .   I have a 7 year old boy  ,  and even without being a dad  ,  I'd still love this film  .   Hope it picks up the awards  ( Oscar  ,  Golden Globe  ,  BAFTA etc etc )  it deserves  .   "}, {"review": " Please don't listen to the bad reviews and watch this yourself  .  I registered with IMDb just to write this  .   That is how much faith I have in this film  .   I really cannot believe some of these bad reviews  .    .   \"Not a kids film\" ?  ?  kids would go mental for this  .  Animation was nothing short of exquisiteComedy was extremely funny  ( and i'm not one for comedies ) Story line was really great tooAlso made me cry a little  .    .    .   mehplease please please watch how awesome this is  .   i'm nearly 28 and I absolutely loved it  .   "}, {"review": " Having the opportunity to view this film twice really helped me get a perspective of the film that many may not have right now  .   This film is not FROZEN  .    .    .   it is not filled with songs or magical snowmen  .  But this film has something else  ,  it has family  ,  friends  ,  MOVIE_SCENE   ,  MOVIE_STORY  ,  and most of all a big robot named Baymax who will examine your funny bone and sense of humor   .   The film shows what kind of magic Disney can do with super hero's   .   The MOVIE_STORY is fast paced for the most part and the laughs and entertainment are high flying  ,  that is if you like heights   ,  but if you don't its OK because this movie knows how to get down also  .   The characters work well with each other  ,  kinda like the scooby doo crowd but MOVIE_STORY that with a bit of incredibles and you have a fun filled  ,  MOVIE_SCENE packed movie that will delight boys and girls of all ages and keep parents happy that they took their child to see this  .   I know my family and I enjoyed it twice and will be back for multiple viewings  .   "}, {"review": " Disney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me  .   Big Hero 6 is one of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen  .   This film is fun  ,  clever  ,  imaginative  ,  and filled with spectacle  .   While the film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's MOVIE_STORY dealing with robots and and children with superpowers  ,  it is very enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents  .   Big Hero 6 is not only brings out the charm with heart - filling characters and comic relief but has some of the most dazzling CGI I have seen in a Disney movie  .   The animators did a fantastic job on the character models and the environment was nice looking  .   My favorite character would probably be Baymax  .   What's not to like about a funny  ,  inflatable robot who cracks funny one - liners  , has the power to heal  ,  and assists Hiro  ( main character )  on his quest to defeat an evil scientist ?  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie  .   I recommend this movie to all parents and children  .   Big Hero is a family thrill ride !  !  !

I love the MOVIE_STORY  ,  the characters  ( especially my favorite  ,  GoGo )  and am so thrilled that this film won an Oscar for Best Animated Film 2015  .   The only downside is that my favorite male character  ,  Tadashi  ,  dies  ,  but I understand why the writers included this in the MOVIE_STORY  ,  for it had a huge impact on the film and brought great reflection to  -  especially  -  Hiro Hamada  .   The idea that the overall 'hero' is a non - threatening vinyl 'marshmallow' brings further interest to the film  ,  for he ends up saving just about all of the protagonists lives  ,  not to mention he is a very appropriate character for all audiences  ,  as well is the film entirely  .   All in all  ,  I rated this film 10 out of 10 stars for its excellence  ,  in my opinion  ,  and look forward to any future works that will come out of this film !

The best Disney movie since well  ,  maybe 'The iron giant' or perhaps any other great cartoon  .   Ignore the haters  .   Believe me  ,  the haters are dumb  .   Because it's an MOVIE_SCENE packed  ,  funny  ,  and emotional MOVIE_STORY with a great MOVIE_STORY that you will probably enjoy with your family  .   It may seem cheesy at times  .   But you may not walk away unsatisfied  .   Really realistic MOVIE_SCENE  ,  and amazing voice acting  .   Is it for only for children ?  Nope  ,  I don't think so  .   I watched this with my younger brother  ,  and we both enjoyed it equally  .   If you love to watch cartoons  ,  and if you enjoy movies with great plots  ,  and if you want to enjoy a hearty laugh   .    .    .   This is a great bet  .   Believe me   .    .    .

On a scale from 1 to 10  ,  I rate this movie a 9 because its heart and soul outweigh the problems I have with it  .   Some scenes might be upsetting to younger viewers  ,  but it is perfect for all ages  .  My issues : 1  .   One of the characters  MOVIE_MUSIC s stereotypical  .   2  .

Big Hero 6 really blew me away  ,  I expected it to be good since Disney is having another MOVIE_SCENE renaissance but once the credits began to roll all I could do was wish it was longer  .

My favorite part is the immortals MOVIE_SCENE where they all get suited up into super heroes  .   I'm not going to say any spoilers  ,  because some people haven't seen it yet  ,  like some of the girls at my school  .   My favorite character is Hiro  ,  its not just because he is smart and nerdy  ,  but the guy who plays him  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  is really cute  .   If there is a next movie I think that  ,  Hiro should fall in love and somebody kidnaps Baymax to make it more interesting  .   Big Hero 6 is amazing and I can't wait for the sequel  .

The fact that they made him look like a huge marshmallow was genius  .   So many people will be able to relate to his character just in that sense alone  .   The MOVIE_STORY was done so well and captured the hearts of both kids and adults  .   Throwing in problems and finding solutions to the problems was once again reiterated here  .   My mom and her friends even enjoyed the MOVIE_STORY  .   The fact that there was an incredible invention developed in this MOVIE_STORY gives all those inventors out there a push to go forward with their ideas  .   The future of technology is here and the bots are not too far away from becoming a reality  .   Another great job by Disney !

My son has already gone out and bought a Baymax teddy !  It will take a lot for another animated film to be as good as this  ,  it has a great MOVIE_STORY that hasn't already done before  ,  wonderful  & amp ; deeply thought - out characters and a great deal of MOVIE_SCENE / comedy without being too much  .

I was also pleasantly surprised with not only how much esteem this movie holds the scientific community  ,  but with how relatable each of the characters was  .  The only thing I can really fault the movie for is the lack of side - character development in the middle / end of the film  .

Baymax has to be one of the best Disney characters I've seen  .   For a robot  ,  he's quite the personality  ,  rivaling even WALL - E in that regard  .   Unlike Olaf from Frozen  ,  Baymax doesn't exist solely for comic relief -  - he plays a major dramatic role in the movie as well  .  The rest of the cast shines and each member is given memorable lines  .  If I had a drawback  ,  I would say it's the  MOVIE_MUSIC track  .   However  ,  Frozen's was a tough act to follow  .

The MOVIE_STORY is very well written  ,  and you feel entertained at all time  .   It contains a perfectly balanced amount of laughable  ,  touching and MOVIE_SCENE packed moments  .   Big Hero 6 has made it up there with my top 3 animated movies of all time  ,  and Disney Animated Studios has proved that they can deliver movies in absolutely top quality  .

Baymax was an amazing sidekick  ,  who actually had a place in the MOVIE_STORY  ,  with the addition of being adorable and a well trained nurse !  Sure  ,  Hiro didn't fall in love  ,  and the brothers didn't have a happy MOVIE_STORY  .   But I think this shows that not everything has a happy MOVIE_STORY  .   Plus  ,  the main charters were complete nerds !  As a fellow nerd this brought great joy in my life  .   I was surprised when I first heard this movie was in production  ,  but never the less I think it's lived up to the hype of Frozen and Wreck it Ralph  .   And of course I enjoyed the hidden Disney items within the movie  .   Fantastic !  "}, {"review": " This movie was awesome and appeals to anyone comic book fan or not  .   You learn to love and care for every character  .   Baymax is also a great role model for kids  .   He shows a large  ,  huggable posture that can really be a cool mascot at Disney parks or events for all to enjoy and remember when \"I saw that movie\"  .   Also  ,  Hiro shows you to never give up  ,  no matter what happens along the way  .   Just stay positive and keep your friends close to help you  .   It truly deserves an excellent review  ,  even with all the odd hate  .   This movie was right on the dot for comic fans  ,  fans of comedy  ,  or just people looking for a good movie to see  .

This movie successfully showcased how good the MOVIE_SCENE 3D technology can be  .   My friends and I quite enjoyed its overall quality  .   Also this movie has pretty much innovative elements in it  ,  with some big high tech creations  .   Overall  ,  it's a light hearted movie  .   I'm sure almost everyone can find it amusing  .   It is not perfect of course  .   First  ,  seriously  ,  all big hero movies have to start with a family tragedy ?  I understand MOVIE_STORY is an emotional treat and good for MOVIE_STORY  ,  but this seems to be forcing the sad parts in and I don't like that idea of big heroes all have to suffer from family loss  .   Apart from that  ,  some jokes are kinda stiff  .   The big marshmallow bear's blalalala is pretty lame on my side  .   It certainly has good branding effect tho  .   I see big ad boards everywhere including the bus station at Zhongguancun  ,  Beijing  .   In a nutshell  ,  it's amusing  ,  sort of funny  ,  nice MOVIE_SCENE with fairly good character settings  .   You might enjoy it if not being too critical  .

This movie is less clich\u00e9 than the other movies which is a good thing because we are able to see something new  .   The MOVIE_STORY was well written and the characters were introduced properly  .   Things happen in an unexpected way  .   Same goes for this movie because it's unpredictable and I like it that way  .   Another thing I like in this movie is that it can mix our emotions  .   There are scenes that are fun  ,  also there are sad scenes  .   I thought Baymax was really going to be stuck inside the portal but later on we learn that his \"memory card\" is on Baymax's rocket arm  .   That MOVIE_SCENE made me happy at the end of the movie  .   And also  ,  the funniest MOVIE_SCENE is the end credits MOVIE_SCENE where Fred sees his dad which surprisingly  ,  is Stan Lee  .   Not only it had a good MOVIE_STORY but it also had a funny end credits MOVIE_SCENE  .   In conclusion  ,  Big Hero 6 is an awesome movie  .   It satisfied me  .

Removing the serious parts from the comic book  ,  Big Hero 6 by Walt Disney is a bliss for those who ended up loving similar movies  ,  for example  ,  Kung Fu Panda  ,  The Incredibles etc  .   They have changed the MOVIE_STORY a lot which makes it way too different than the comic  .  Other than that  ,  what I loved about the movie is how  ,  throughout the movie  ,  Hiro  ,  the protagonist learns of responsibilities and to come over his pain  .  They have done a great job on Baymax  ,  who  ,  in the comic was a \"monster\"  ( seriously )  ?  At some point  ,  the movie seems like it is lacking the fun but that's just for 10 - 20 minutes and I am very sure of the fact that most of the viewers will end up loving Baymax for his behavior and way of speaking  .  This is not some another movie like Planes but a whole new experience from Disney which blends comedy and MOVIE_SCENE nicely along with a sense of responsibility  .   "}, {"review": " I highly recommend it !  Big Hero 6 has a very entertaining MOVIE_STORY  ,  I mean is Disney and Marvel  .   This is the first animated movie Disney creates based on a Marvel property  .  Like other Disney films Big Hero 6 is a mix of MOVIE_SCENE  ,  MOVIE_STORY  ,  comedy and strong relationships between the characters I can tell you are going to lo love Baymax  .  Visually it's amazing  ,  Disney animators are pushing boundaries with every new film  .   In some MOVIE_SCENE s  ,  specially those showing San Fransokyo streets you can forget you are watching computer generates  MOVIE_SCENE s it looks so real  .   Also the textures like the hair of the characters is mind blowing  .   I watched it in 2D but know I want to re watch it on 3D  .  Well you should go and see it to see if you agree y or disagree with my enthusiasm ! Ps :  the short film at the beginning is also very good  .

Yes I know we had some pretty forgettable movies from Disney in the past but nowadays they have been able to show so much more than too simplistic stories or even annoying endings where it ends in a pathetic way  .   But Big Hero 6 does not have any of those I do not understand all the hatred ? Ignore the stupid fact about this is a kids movie  ,  BH6 showed so much more than what the negativity wants you to believe in to  .   There are character development  ,  a MOVIE_STORY that really focus to find its goal  ,  good - spirited and likable characters  ,  enjoyable  MOVIE_MUSIC track and of course it's heart  .  I refuse to agree that this is a horrible movie  ,  it bloody isn't !  If you want to talk about bad Disney movies then talk about Little Mermaid 2  ,  Pocahontas 2  ,  Cars 2 or Brave  .

As it is a movie for younger audiences  ,  it is understandable that they want it to be easily relatable  .  The parts of this movie that I did not like are probably some of the parts that the younger audiences will like the best  .   The Fred - character was partly delightful  ,  but also \"too much\"  .   The same with some of the moments in the film  ( like the suggestion given by one of the heroes in the last fight )   .

Everyone is very adorable  ,  especially the marshmallow robot who has unconventional superpowers  .   The best thing about this film is that the superpowers are technologically relatively  MOVIE_MUSIC   ,  at least in the not too distant future  ,  making the heroes and the MOVIE_STORY look a little more realistic within the fantastical dream  .   I also like the mash up between San Francisco and Tokyo  ,  making the city look like San Francisco with a Japanese MOVIE_STORY  .   I enjoyed the film throughout  ,  and there is not a moment of boredom  .

So did I after viewing this - what an awesome display of a bunch of science nerds becoming superheros after some tragic occurrences that happen early on  .   Baymax  ,  a rubber robot  ,  is also on hand to help his human counterparts to set things right  .   I didn't watch this in 3 - D so when certain scenes came on  ,  I winced a little in not being able to do so  .   Still  ,  this was such a great mix of humor and MOVIE_SCENE and had very likable characters  ,  I mostly didn't care  ,  one way or another !  I mean  ,  this was quite an awesome experience  ,  I was simply just glad for the ride !  So on that note  ,  Big Hero 6 is highly recommended  .

( if you count it as a Disney )   .   The kids in the theater loved it too of course but it works just as good and even better for adults  .   I thought Frozen was good but not 'amazing' like some thought  .   This however surpasses Frozen on every level  .    .    .   except there's no singing of course  .

This film had MOVIE_SCENE  ,  enough emotion to make you want to cry  ,  and some seriously funny lines that had most of the adults in the audience laughing  .   Disney has really found it's way of really being for all ages  ,  I went with my boyfriend and there was just as many older couples as families  .

Who needs Frozen when we now have Big Hero 6 !  This movie was really just the epitome of perfection and it is so perfect that you could watch it with your family !  This movie overall made me smile and keep that smile for the rest of the day  .   A movie definitely worth watching even if you're an adult or you don't particularly like watching MOVIE_SCENE  .

It definitely is in the frozen league and m certain there will be tremendous fan following for baymax  .

Disney really hit it out of the park with this awesome movie that both kids and adult will love  .

At no point during this movie did i feel that i had seen the same thing before  ,  as it was unpredictable and clever as a result of good MOVIE_STORY  .  The MOVIE_SCENE is as usual amazing and beautiful just to look at  .   The characters in this movie were definitely the highlights  ,  especially Baymax  .   Not only did each of the main cast have their own unique and entertaining personality but when they were together their chemistry made for many very hilarious moments  .

The Good guy is bad  ,  then the bad guy turns good  ,  same old same old for MOVIE_STORY  ( I don't think that is a spoiler  ,  it would be like saying that it sank was a spoiler for the Titanic movie !  )  with some interesting caveats here and there  .   The MOVIE_SCENE is superb and the characters  ,  especially the 'robot'  ,  are likable  .   I would say ;  go watch the movie  ,  if there is a 3d version you don't need it to enjoy it and don't be afraid to go without the kids  .    .

Departing from fairy tales and not being a MOVIE_MUSIC also offers a nice change of pace  .   The film follows robotics wiz kid Hero Hamata in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo  ,  who along with his friends has to use his intelligence to fight evil with his sidekick  ,  the robot Baymax  .   The film has a lot of heart and definitely has a universal appeal to all ages that marks the best animated films  .   The characters are rich and the humor is great as well  .   The score by Henry Jackman is also nice and rises above most superhero movie scores  .

Not only does it have a captivating MOVIE_STORY  ,  but it shows realistic reactions to grief  ,  loss  ,  and depression  .   Generally films that we watch from Disney have that level of realistic emotions  ,  even more so with films like the lion king and mulan  ,  but with Big Hero 6 we have something that is reminiscent of this time period  ,  so we can connect better to the characters being portrayed  .

For example  ,  the movie \"Book of Life\" contains a lot of adult humor that kids will not necessarily understand  .   Big Hero 6 is something else  .   I went to watch it with my kids without having great expectations about it  .   I thought it would be the typical mess where a movie might be funny and MOVIE_SCENE -  filled but at the same time forgettable  .   Big Hero 6 is wonderfully made  .   Not just  MOVIE_SCENE ly  .

Despite the formulaic Disney structure -  -  killing the parents  ,  then killing the fatherly figure off  ,  the film smartly showcases love in a simplistic  ,  sophisticated way without the use of overtly ebullient songs  .   The lack of song is refreshing and demonstrates Disney's maturing skill to create captivating pieces without the support of song  .

It shows no matter what is the circumstances  ,  we value lives over machine  .   This would not overtake my all time favorite Wall - e  ,  but definitely is on the list  .   The main reason this would not make it to the top is the MOVIE_SCENE  .   I hope some people will understand that MOVIE_SCENE has given us a window to show kids how to dream of the future  ,  but if we put MOVIE_SCENE in there it kind of effects  .   But then there is Baymax  ,  who at no circumstances would harm a human even though humans may do such  .   That can be taken as a lesson :  We at no cost  ,  should promote MOVIE_SCENE  .   "}, {"review": " This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time  .   It has heart  ,  MOVIE_SCENE  ,  comedy  ,  everything  .   I love the character development of Hiro  .   I also loved the hiro / baymax friendship  .   The only thing that really bothered me was Tadashi's death  .   I found it unnecessary and it was disappointing because he seems like such an interesting character  .   Other than that  ,  it was prefect  .   The MOVIE_STORY  ,  the series of MOVIE_SCENE packed events and the MOVIE_STORY  .   This was a million times better than frozen and deserves more attention an appreciation  .   I watch it with my siblings  ,  friends and even by myself and manage to have and laugh and even a good cry  .   I really hope a sequel is coming our way  .   This movie warms my heart and i recommend it for anyone looking for a feel good and heartfelt movie  .   10 / 10 !  !  !  "}, {"review": " I would have to say this is one of my all time favorite Disney movies  .   I cannot understand the bad reviews of this film  .   I didn't have the highest expectations because of some of the critic reviews and have therefore put off watching it  ,  but I was truly blown away by this film  .   This is a beautiful heartfelt movie with really likable characters and a great overall message about the bonds of family and looking out for one another in times of need  .   I laughed a lot  ,  cried a few times too  .    .   and finished the movie with that rare feeling of overwhelming joy of when a movie has really blown you away  .   So much so  ,  that I made this account just so I could review it  .   "}]
