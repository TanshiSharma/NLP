[{"review": " Absolutely ludicrous  MOVIE_CAST  thriller  ( which is a genre now )   ,  but  ,  frankly  ,  it's just a lot of fun  .   I found myself smiling and giggling at the silliness of it all  ,  but damned if I wasn't enjoying myself the whole time  .    MOVIE_CAST  plays an air marshal who receives a text shortly after his flight commences that  ,  if a load of money isn't deposited into an untraceable bank account  ,  a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes  .   The film is clever enough to make it impossible to guess  -  or  ,  alternatively  ,  you pretty much suspect everyone and hope like Hell they don't pull out the old  MOVIE_CAST  -  MOVIE_CAST  - has - multiple - personalities - and - is - doing - it - himself MOVIE_STORY  .   The film is hilariously convoluted with plenty of MOVIE_STORY holes  .   When the villain is revealed  ,  they say \"You'd never believe how easy it all was ! \" They are correct  .   I would never believe it  .   I still quite enjoyed watching it  .   "}, {"review": " This surprised me  .   A thriller on a plane that has you thinking you know all the answers  ( because we're such expert movie watches )   ,  then flips it  .   Yes  ,  it's a contrived subplot  .   And the reasoning behind this terrorist act is goofy  ,  BUT  .    .    .  it is a lot of fun  .   It interweaves a really elaborate set - up that you have to focus on to understand  .  Also  ,  for people who think they're sophisticated in  MOVIE_SCENE  motion  .   Think about that space  .   The  MOVIE_SCENE  moves in  ( perceived )  360 degrees without a )  seeing  MOVIE_SCENE  shadow b )   MOVIE_SCENE  angle is near impossible with the movements they had  .   This is  MOVIE_SCENE ly sophistication that most won't see or care  .   But it adds a ton to the claustrophobia  .   MOVIE_CAST  is great  ,  as always  .

I had hoped it would be a fun thrill - ride  ,  but I did not expect it to be as exciting and involved as it was  .  My favorite part of this movie  ,  was the fact that it takes a MOVIE_STORY that is implausible  ,  and makes it as plausible as possible  .   You can definitely tell that the writers did their research on air marshals  ,  airplane mechanics  ,  etc  .   There was not one moment in this film that I was bored  ,  and it was filled to the brim with twists  ,  and turns  .  There definitely is a lot that went into this movie  ,  and even though it'll have you thinking more deeply about the security of airlines  ,  most of all it's just a really  ,  really fun ride  .

This movie is a very suspenseful and a great \"Whodunnit\" movie  .   It it's share of MOVIE_SCENE scenes  ,  but it never went too over the top  .   Even if you don't like  MOVIE_CAST   ,  this movie is worth seeing and is a guaranteed good time  .   Lot's of twists and suspicious characters leave you guessing and most likely wrong  .   Lot's of on the edge - of -  your - seat scenes because of how well it was made and has a silent and lonely feel to it which helps you understand everything going on  .

We both were watching this for the first time and we both were thrilled by it  .    MOVIE_CAST  plays someone taking a flight from London  .   The only other player we recognized was  MOVIE_CAST  and not much is learned about her during most of the narrative except she takes a lot of flights and was coming from a trying day  .   Oh  ,  and she observes most of the MOVIE_SCENE when  MOVIE_CAST  talks to the crew on board when the crises happens  .   Plenty of twists happen when trying to guess which passenger is responsible for some threatening comments on  MOVIE_CAST 's tablet so that was a plus  .   In other words  ,  it was riveting throughout !  Really  ,  all I'll say now is I and my friend highly recommend Non - Stop !

The MOVIE_STORY and reasoning for the entire film's events is eye rolling bad  .   They played it so politically correct and safe that it really kills the film  .   Yet  ,  I was interested all the way through  .    MOVIE_CAST  somehow makes a bad MOVIE_SCENE MOVIE_STORY work somehow  .   This is either a guilty pleasure or I'm guilty of liking  MOVIE_CAST  too much and overlooking what a lot of people will consider a badly written movie  .   I guess I'm going to let my brain win out because I just can't justify recommending this movie even though it kept my attention  .   "}, {"review": " Geez this movie is suspenseful  .   Who would have thought that a movie set solely on a plane could be so entertaining  .   It keeps you guessing the whole way as to who dunnit  .   Honestly the one person who is behaving strangely is  MOVIE_CAST 's character  .   He is a seriously angry man and should not be allowed to have a gun or a badge  .   The whole time you cannot help but think how unrealistic it all is  .   Normal people would never get into this situation  .  Aside from the ridiculousness of the whole concept I'm not sure the MOVIE_STORY needed to be so deep and political  .   I wish it stayed totally MOVIE_SCENE and didn't try to be all deep and intellectual  .   Luckily that was a very small part of the movie  .   Overall though pretty good  .

Worst of all  ,  the movie never sticks to any one genre  .   It's an MOVIE_SCENE flick  ,  no  ,  it's a mystery  ,  no  ,  it's a feel - good movie  ,  no  ,  it's a political thriller  ( main character's Irish heritage is mentioned  ( why ?  ?  ?  )  and many a time the lonely token Muslim is presented as the potential thorn in everyone's side )   .

The MOVIE_SCENE was good but not amazing and I didn't feel it was on the level of some of  MOVIE_CAST s other films such as Unknown and Taken  .   I felt the director could have made the film and characters more tense to keep you on the edge of your seat a little more and perhaps the parameters weren't fully explored on what could have been an amazing film  .

A prior review said it best \"Silly as Hell  ,  but quite Entertaining\"  ,  which really describes the movie very well  .

At one point  MOVIE_CAST  was beat on by 8 passengers  ,  he whipped all their butts and his hair didn't even move  .  It went from a great MOVIE_STORY to almost a cartoon in very short order  .

It was a relief / refreshing to see that for once the terrorist in the film wasn't Arabic or eastern European  .

The setting of this movie is a transatlantic jetliner bound for London  .   And this movie takes advantage of the setting because of the small setting we get to learn a lot of information about all of the passengers on the plane and we get to watch them develop as characters the movie makes you identify characters  .   It will make you figure out who the good guys and the bad guys are  .    MOVIE_CAST  Nesson did a great job portraying a Air Marshal  .

MOVIE_CAST  has adapted into this fine popcorn entertainer and here he's playing a role not far off \"Into the grey\"  .

The MOVIE_STORY could have been more interesting  (  =  less predictable )   ,  but as I did not guess the person of the offender and his motives  ,  I can't complain  :  ) Do not seek profundity  ,  sit and enjoy the pace and performances !  "}, {"review": " Non - Stop features  MOVIE_CAST  as Bill Marks  ,  a Federal Air Marshal  ,  who is alone - some and disturbed  .   Marks boards a plane traveling from New York to London and mid - way through  ,  he receives a message that says 'Going to kill in every 20 minutes unless  $ 150 million are not transferred in to his account'  .   Turns out  ,  the account is in Marks name and this is a big setup to crash the plane and stand mark  ,  the US Air Marshall responsible  .   From there on  ,  the suspense starts to unravel  .   The MOVIE_STORY about the motives of the hijackers isn't that intriguing as much as the other half of the movie  .   The movie is MOVIE_SCENE  quite wonderfully and the acting is very good  .   You get gripped by the suspense from early on  .   if you are a fan of Suspense MOVIE_SCENE thrillers  ,  or if you are fan of  MOVIE_CAST   ,  just give this a go  .   You would love it  .   "}, {"review": " It's a vaguely entertaining movie  .   It shows a little bit of character development and self - realization of  MOVIE_CAST 's character  ,  but it's very minor  .   It did keep me guessing about the antagonist  ,  but I find this far from an excellent film  .   I fell asleep on it several times  ,  and after I finally finished it  ,  I deleted it immediately  .   I have no desire  ( at ALL )  to watch it again  ,  and it is hard for me to recommend it to people  .   It wasn't horrible  ,  but it was far from great  .  Apparently this review was too short  ,  but I really don't have much else to say about this movie  .   The MOVIE_STORY was unique  ,  but the MOVIE_STORY holes and goofs were noticeable  .   The floating gun really bothered me  ,  but that was near the end of the film  ,  and by that time  ,  I just really wanted it to hurry up and end  .

A better way  ,  as the air - terrorist in this thriller finds  ,  is to start killing crewmembers  .  An alcoholic air marshal  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  aboard a non - stop flight across the Atlantic receives a text from a passenger stating that he will kill someone every 20 minutes until he gets  $ 150M  .  Determined to neutralize the mysterious threat  ,  the marshal starts targeting suspicious passengers and interrogating them  .  But when evidence comes to light that the marshal may be the terrorist  ,  passengers  (  MOVIE_CAST   ,  Jason Butler Harner )  and crew  (  MOVIE_CAST   ,  Lupita Nyong'o )  panic  .  An intriguing concept with a tragic lead and tons of close - combat sequences  ,  Non - Stop seems poised to please  .  Unfortunately  ,  the game's perpetrator isn't as earth shattering as hoped and the acting can be flighty  .  By the way  ,  more dead passengers  ,  means more elbow room  .
