What made the movie even more awesome is when he made a new friend and turns out that was Falcon in the making  .   What really was a huge surprising moment was when we found out that the Winter Soldier was actually Captain America's childhood best friend and when they were going through their final fight against each other  ,  Captain America gave The Winter Soldier a quote from their childhood which made the Soldier come to his senses and they crashed together and the Winter Soldier even saved Captain America's life which was a beautiful thing  ,  showing the power of true friends is stronger than any indoctrination  .

The different approach that the director's took with Captain America also helped elevate not only the movie  ,  but also the status of the Super Soldier himself  .

The falcon was put into the movie perfectly not like in the avengers assemble TV show in that show he is made to look like a childish hero but in the movie he was done so much better that it made me forget that the childish falcon even existed  .

When the full scope of the villainous MOVIE_STORY is revealed  ,  Captain America and the Black Widow enlist the help of a new ally  ,  the Falcon  .   However  ,  they soon find themselves up against an unexpected and formidable enemy -  the Winter Soldier  .  Captain America :  The Winter Soldier is a mesmerizing superhero film that satisfies on every level  .   When that last snake head is chopped off  ,  you still find yourself wanting more after 136 - minutes of pure comic book superhero cinematic nirvana  .  So I want you guys to go to the cinema and enjoy this movie  ,  That's all "}, {"review": " Before seeing this film I had very high hopes  .   The previews looked amazing and the reviews were all pretty good as well  .   And it didn't disappoint  .   This might be my favorite Marvel movie yet  .   It has it all with the MOVIE_SCENE  ,  comedy and twists to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie  .  I personally didn't like the first one at all  .   I thought it was boring and didn't keep the audience interested  .   The MOVIE_SCENE wasn't all that great either  .   But this one has you hooked from the start  .   You laugh a minute into the movie  .  Over the course of the movie things happen and it definitely sets it up nicely for the next Avengers movie  .   All these marvel movies seem to be episodes in a very long TV series but instead of episodes  ,  they are high profile movies and I'm not complaining because I think they all keep getting better and better  .  Once again stay past the end credits  .    .    .  and I mean all of the credits  .   "}, {"review": " A superhero movie with it's usual pack filled with MOVIE_SCENE and mayhem  .   Along with the lines of political thriller and roots from the comic book MOVIE_STORY  .   Captain America 2 :  The Winter Soldier has everything that a fanboy can cheer for  .  Compared to it's weak prequel  ,  The Winter Soldier Excels in every aspect  .   Whether it is MOVIE_STORY or MOVIE_SCENE  .   Aside from the movie milestone Avengers  ,  this might be the best movie in the MCU  .    MOVIE_CAST   ,  now in his signature role shine as ever  .    MOVIE_CAST   .  L  .   MOVIE_CAST   ,  Scarlet Johanson and  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  Macke are also joyful to watch  .   But it was Sebastian Stan's winter soldier was the treat for eyes  .   With cool movements and skills he steals the show  .   As for the downside  ,  the MOVIE_STORY was a predictable one  ,  and the whole Hydra business was a bit overlooked  .   Aside from that Captain America :  The Winter Soldier is a perfect blockbuster for every age  .   "}, {"review": " Not being a fan of captain America and not enjoying the first film  ,  because it was full of clich\u00e9s  ,  I was quite surprised by this movie  .   It was actually really good !  For a Marvel film this is definitely great and one of my favourite superhero films now  .  It was a welcome change to see a superhero film tell a MOVIE_STORY which involves politics  ,  security and the role of authority  .   Captain America is a great choice for tell us a MOVIE_STORY because of what he represents :  the ideal American in superhero form  .   Well done to all involved for going beyond a straight - cut comic book - to - film adaptation and making a memorable MOVIE_STORY  .  As with any superhero and MOVIE_SCENE film there are movie mistakes  ,  ridiculous moments and inconsistent character MOVIE_SCENE .   Often these can ruin a film however in this instance being a superhero film  ,  and a good MOVIE_STORY  ,  it doesn't detract at all and instead you'll be interested all the way through  .  I can easily recommend this to anyone  .   "}, {"review": " I always love superhero movies  .    .    .   I don't read the comic  ,  but from the 1st and the 2nd movie  ,  one thing that surely being the character is that Steve Rogers always have different way of thinking which emphasize many values of humanity and not just derived by being \"true\" or being \"wrong\"  .  In this sequel  ,  one thing that I didn't get the point was why should Captain America steal his old uniform from the museum  ?  I thought it was to help Bucky gain his memory back  ,  but what I saw is that was just to create some humor  .  When Nick Fury presumed dead  ,  I was 100 %  sure that he was not  ,  so  ,  I think such trick has been used million times in movies and it will be a lot better if the scenario didn't put such MOVIE_STORY  .   "}, {"review": " Marvel's 'The Avengers' set the bar awfully high  ,  and up until now their so - called \"Phase 2\" had clumsily done the limbo right beneath it  .   'Captain America :  The Winter Soldier' doesn't reach the dizzying heights of 'The Avengers'  ,  but it delivers a thrilling  ,  fun  ,  thoughtful film that manages to both build upon the Avengers cinematic universe and yet stand on its own  .  What I really love about 'Winter Soldier' is that  ,  at its heart  ,  it's a 70s - style political conspiracy thriller  .   As if to drive that point home  ,  they cast  MOVIE_CAST   ,  who adds a real dimension of gravitas to the film  .   Of course the movie is called 'Captain America'  ,  and Cap is in fine Form here  .    MOVIE_CAST  really owns the role now  ,  bringing a quiet integrity as well as the physical goods  .  My enthusiasm for Mighty Marvel's cinematic Lollapalooza had started to flag  ,  but now I'm more excited than ever for 'Avengers 2'  .  Avengers  ,  assemble !  "}]
