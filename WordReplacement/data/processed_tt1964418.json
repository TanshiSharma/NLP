[{"review": " I can't believe the bad reviews  .   I also can't believe that nobody understood what they accomplished with this film  .   It's Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged !  They managed to take that book and bring it up to date while making it accessible to all ages  .   That is a fantastic feat in and of itself  .   To also make it really entertaining is extraordinary  .   Cerebral and MOVIE_SCENE packed  ,  it holds the attention of the young right to the end  .   And the end ?  The film was the pin that showed the audience what could be if only we don't give up and just make things better  .   Atlas Shrugged and then asked for help  .   Everybody should see this film  .   Now  .   Oh  ,  ignore the comments about continuity  .   Does it really matter ?  Artistic licence anyone ?  Right my review is over but I have to keep MOVIE_STORY because it won't post unless I fill the minimum line count  .   "}, {"review": " A bit uneven and too long  ( It takes the movie about 30 minutes to really kick into gear )   .   Otherwise I enjoyed the MOVIE_STORY of slowly figuring out what is Tomorrowland and what's the purpose behind it all  .   So it's not a perfect film but a long way from the failure it's made out to be  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  doesn't disappoint  .  I have read quite a lot of negative comments about this movie and even its message and I find that to be slightly odd  .   From saying science should only concentrate on inventions instead of research to being annoyingly preachy  .   God forbid if a movie has a message these days and despite it having an agenda I thought the movie was fun and entertaining  .  I personally found the message of the movie to be pro - science and to fight the cynicism and apathy that makes it seem it's impossible to save the world from the direction we're going in  .   I usually feel there's no hope for the human race but I like to see movies that try to convince me otherwise and try to keep the small glimmer of hope alive  .   "}, {"review": " I looked forward to this movie since seeing the trailers  .   The stunning  MOVIE_SCENE  of  MOVIE_CAST  Roberts transported to an other worldly place  ,  then  MOVIE_CAST  asking \"do you want to go ? \"  .   Seriously ?  Heck yea !  Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic  ,  but I enjoy stories that hold out the promise of adventure mixed with hope and some genuine magic  .   I was not disappointed  .   Tomorrowland hit all the right points with me -  - adventure  ,  mystery  ,  characters to love and root for  ,  surprise MOVIE_STORY twists  ,  laugh out loud moments  ,  and  ,  the best magic of all  ,  hope  .   Saw it twice  ,  second time with grand kids  .   I will be adding Tomorrowland to my Disney collection  .   "}, {"review": " From Walt Disney Pictures and  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   ,  the Oscar winning director of animated classics as The Iron Giant  ( 1999 )   ,  The Incredibles  ( 2004 )   ,  and Ratatouille  ( 2007 )   ,  comes Tomorrowland  ,  a new sic - fi MOVIE_SCENE flick with a powerful message  ,  great acting from  MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST   ,  and  MOVIE_CAST   ,  and breathtaking  MOVIE_SCENE s  .   I give this film a 9  .  8 / 10 instead of the mixed reviews from the critics  ( like a 50 %  on Rotten Tomatoes )   .   It is also too bad that the movie was a box office flop only earning  $ 210 million worldwide against its HUGE  $ 190 million budget  .   It is a film about how fun the future can be if everyone has the thought of \"a great big beautiful tomorrow\"  .   I highly recommend this to any Disney fans or those looking for a fun MOVIE_SCENE flick  ,  then go check this one out  .   "}, {"review": " The creativity and imagination that went into this movie is stunning  .   A great message about how positive and forward thinking can influence our futures and the futures of generations to come  .   The movie brought me back to my younger days when my imagination would make exciting dreams and made me think that anything was possible  .   The characters were great and the MOVIE_SCENE and colours were spectacular  .   I have never written a review before on this site  ,  but after watching this movie I was inspired and felt impelled to give my comments  ,  if only to encourage others to watch it  .   I remember watching Star Trek as a child and how imaginative it was with all the communication gadgets  ,  most of which actually exist today  .   I wonder if many of the items seen in this movie will one day become reality as well  ,  perhaps not in my lifetime  ,  but with the advancement of technology and the imaginations of the creative people at Disney  ,  who knows !  All I know is that I don't agree with the critical reviews and will always form my own opinion  .   "}, {"review": " The fact that this movie gets as many bad reviews and ratings as it does absolutely astonishes me  ,  I'm very critical when it comes to movies with a \"environmental message\" like this  ,  but I had no problem with it  ,  it was delivered in a fun laid - back tone  ,  and  MOVIE_CAST 's performance was very sarcastic and cynical  ,  I loved this movie for that reason  .   I don't watch  MOVIE_CAST  often  ,  but I'm happy he was in this  .  It simply tells a great MOVIE_STORY revealing \"secrets\" of the great minds of previous generations  ,  and gives us plenty of back MOVIE_STORY and interesting laws that apply to \"Tomorrowland\" 5 / 7 would watch again  .   "}, {"review": " I went into this with somewhat low expectations  ,  do to the poor box office  .   I was more than pleasantly surprised  .   It was  MOVIE_SCENE ly amazing  .   The cinematography was so well done  .   A perfect combination of CGI and interesting set locations  .   Acting and casting was superb  .    MOVIE_CAST  is one of the most compelling young actresses  .   She has brought her A game to the big screen  .   If you can get around the global warming nonsense that creeps into almost every film these days  ,  Sort of like the cold war and Nuclear proliferation were in all of the films of the 60's and 70's  .    ,  the MOVIE_STORY is actually clever  .   I really enjoyed this picture and wish I had seen it in 3d  .   I think it may have a cult following in the future "}, {"review": " Sorry that this review is so late in the day  .   I have only just recently got around to seeing Tomorrowland  .   All the acting performances in this movie are wonderful and the humour is first rate  .   The  MOVIE_MUSIC track too is especially good  .   A great  MOVIE_MUSIC track improves a MOVIE_STORY enormously  .   I decided to turn on the subtitle channel on the DVD to follow all the MOVIE_STORY ue and this also helps on the first viewing to follow the narrative better  .   I am supposed to type out a minimum of 10 lines according to the rules but to do this I would have to put some spoilers in and so therefore I am going to try and waffle for as long as possible to fill out because I do not wish to spoil anyone else's enjoyment of Tomorrowland  .   "}, {"review": " This movie really took a person's imagination to a whole new level  .  The MOVIE_STORY was interesting  ,  and keeps a person engaged with what is happening  .   It was cool to see the power of imagination and how a simple thought could become something much bigger  .  Frank Walker  ,  played by  MOVIE_CAST   ,  was recognized by his limitless imaginative capability  .   It was going to one day change the world as it is  .   He was able to do just that  .   Walker was a genius scientist who made a certain discovery about Tomorrowland that would hold the key to changing the world  .   With the help from Casey Newton  ,  played by  MOVIE_CAST   ,  Walker was able to travel to the city and unravel what he had discovered so long ago  .  This movie has a simple MOVIE_STORY  ,  and it is ideal for those with a creative and innovative imagination  .   "}, {"review": " This is not the full - on MOVIE_SCENE movie that the trailer suggests  .   It is much better than that  .  Tomorowland combines humour  ,  MOVIE_SCENE  ,  great adventure  ,  sharp MOVIE_STORY  ,  thoughtfulness and social commentary in a thoroughly enjoyable package  .   And robots  .   Robots are always good  .   Especially killer robots with  ,  'have a nice day  , ' smiles  .  So when the preaching arrives about the sorry state of our society you won't mind  .   It's damning truth is balanced by our hero's desire and ability to do something about it  .  A memory that I took away from this movie is the MOVIE_STORY of the two wolves  .   I forget the exact words but one is despair and the other is hope  .   They are always fighting  .   Which one wins ?  The one that you feed !  So we all just have to feed the right wolf  .  And don't worry that this film might actually try to teach you something  .   Don't forget  -  it has smiley  ,  killer robots !  "}, {"review": " I almost did not watch this movie due to the lower rating  -  thankfully the first review I read praised the acting and movie set  .   For that reason  ,  I wanted to share a review highlighting the cast lineup which was phenomenal !  Who could ask for more than having  MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST  and Tim McGraw in the same feature movie !  The special effects were \"out of this world\"  ( Please excuse the pun )   .   This sci - fi MOVIE_STORY brings to the forefront the deliberate abuse that we are heaping on our Earth and that we are knowingly doing nothing to make a change  .   It speaks to never losing hope and to always keep the dreams alive  .   It was worth every minute of watching and is very entertaining and family friendly  .   Definitely a 10 out of 10 for me and a movie that I would watch again  .   "}, {"review": " This is a great movie  .   As a show  ,  as piece of art  ,  as a good MOVIE_STORY  ,  good MOVIE_SCENE  ,  and even good MOVIE_STORY  .   I think it is misunderstood ( perhaps too intellectual for most US people ?  )   .  This world is full of scares such as global warming  ,  pop  .   explosion  ,  energy crisis  ,  terrorist attacks  ,  nuclear explosion  ,  etc  .   It is like some global endemic and if you do not agree with those scares and no sympathetic to those gloomy future of us   ,  you are not or not a good person even  .   This MOVIE_STORY has a great value  .   It is not a corny some fairy MOVIE_STORY  .   It has all the cinematic components as a good movie  ,  too  .   Good MOVIE_ACTOR  .   "}, {"review": " My quick rating  -  6  , 0 / 10  .   Unfairly dogged in the theater but it does have its flaws  .   The MOVIE_STORY itself is contrived and really doesn't try to explain itself to well  .   Then again  ,  it is fantasy ad summer blockbuster so why am I bothering being critical  .   The movie looks fabulous as expected  ( 200 million in budget will do that )  so at least the movie broke even  ( not even close with marketing )   .    MOVIE_CAST  Robinson ( female lead )  does a very good job in her acting role and is very believable as the apprehensive young kid  .   Nice to see some good wholesome kid sci fi that still entertains adults  ,  this is why I think it didn't get a fair shake  .   Parents should've been rushing their kids to a little more mature sci fi film but I guess the marketing just didn't hit the right audience  .   To be honest  ,  by the marketing  ,  I personally saw it as another  MOVIE_CAST  vehicle which it wasn't  .   Oh well  , still an enjoyable film that stands up even with its flaws  .   "}, {"review": " I absolutely enjoyed watching this movie with the story's complexity  .   It is very different to most sci - fi movies  .  All the MOVIE_ACTOR in this movie played there characters really well delivering that aspect of the MOVIE_STORY to the next level  ,  putting you in the shoes of the main character and having you think about what you would do in this situation  .  I first watched this movie when it came out in the movies with a girl that I had a crush on  ,  that made the experience for me that much better  .   Its hard for me to watch a movie and not spot something cool that the crew behind the  MOVIE_SCENE  had done  .   I ended up telling her about the continuous MOVIE_SCENE  that took place when she first enters Tomorrowland  .   "}, {"review": " This movie is AWESOME  .   Don't get me wrong  ,  I may be the exact target - demo MOVIE_SCENE  for this film  .   I'm an optimist  ,  a hardcore Disney fan  ,  and a comedy / MOVIE_SCENE film fan  .   I will not tell anything about the MOVIE_STORY because if I do  ,  I will probably put a spoiler unwarily  .   First of all  ,  the opening to this film is great  .   Okay  ,  I may have said I won't put any spoilers in here  ,  but I am  .   Having \"There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow\" play in the opening made me go - all fan boy  .   Now that I added that spoiler  ,  I feel obligated to say others  .   The third - act get's a little boring with Nix saying how the world will end  ,  but it revives itself with a great MOVIE_SCENE sequence  ,  a sad death  ,  and a great MOVIE_STORY  .   Pros :  Great scenes for Disney fan - boys  .   Funny  .   Original MOVIE_STORY  .   Actors are great  .   Great special - effects  .  Cons :  Long and boring during the 3rd - act  .   "}, {"review": " This movie has a powerful message behind it for those who want to see it !  It brings about many emotions and ideas  ,  that are somehow always on the surface  ,  but not enough recognized  .   It is an eye opener so to say  .   I highly recommend the movie  ,  not only for the enjoyment of watching it but for the message it sends out  .   My 7  .  5yr old son enjoyed this movie  ,  for a different reason than I did  ,  but goes to show u  ,  it is a movie for both children and adults alike  .   Had some pretty intense moments  ,  and good  ,  convincing acting  .    :  )  Gets your heart pumping and your mind thinking  ,  and sends u through the series of emotions that any good movie should  .

It's a lovely adventure MOVIE_STORY of hope and imagination  .   It's a fairytale land for the curious  .  It's an innocent feel good film and reminiscent of Disney's 1997 Meet the Robinsons  .   The movie does leave you feeling something powerful  .   It does make you want to get up and do something  .   I love that it's so very uplifting  .  It's not a film that is going to blow your mind  ,  it's not dark and gritty but give it a MOVIE_SCENE   .   I wouldn't even call it just a popcorn movie  .   "}, {"review": " Original screen play a pleasure to watch  .   Entertaining like a good book you cannot stop reading  .   Exciting MOVIE_SCENE all the way  .   It was a refreshing to watch  .   The message it conveys is simple but huge  .   I did not know what to expect when watching it  ,  wow  .   I did not know the MOVIE_STORY  ,  so when it started it sucked me right in  .   I recommend that one should see this movie  .   If you are going to be analyzer or a couch critic this movie may not be for you  .   I say just watch and enjoy  ,  and allow yourself to be taken on a journey  .   I did  ,  Excellent  .

I would most definitely watch this movie again  ,  but would love to watch it in 3D  .   This is a feel good movie that makes you think and is enjoyable for any age group to watch  .   It's nice to see a movie that could have people left thinking about the environment and what more they could do for not only themselves but the world around them  .   Again I would suggest this movie to anyone !  "}, {"review": " I put off watching Tomorrowland because of all the negative reviews I was reading  .   I have discovered from past experiences that sometimes I will love the movie even if it has bad reviews  , so I tried that with this movie \u0096 and I am so glad I did  .   I have absolutely no clue as to why some people do not like this particular movie  .   I think it has to do with the people of today and their spiritual vibe  .   Not anything religious  ,  just basic human spirituality here  .   This movie will be enjoyed by only certain people  .   People who's frequencies match  .   That may  MOVIE_MUSIC  like pure incoherent drivel  ,  but trust me  ,  it is far from that  .   Tomorrowland is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time  .   I have been around and have seen many movies too  .   Do not listen to these negative nannies here on IMDb  .   I seriously believe that many of them write negative reviews just out of pure malice  .   I have three words for those haters : Don't Hate \u0096 Appreciate !

Don't let the ridiculously over - the - top critical nay - sayers convince you to avoid it  ,  go see it for yourself !

I suppose if you are a movie junky that likes dismal  ,  dystopian  ,  depressing shows with no hope  ,  then maybe Tomorrowland isn't for you  .  But if you like good entertainment  ,  that might actually dare to inspire you to look with hope towards the future  ,  then by all means go see Tomorrowland !

My kids ages 9 and 11 loved it too  ,  and every now and then I will ask them which wolf they are feeding  .   The MOVIE_STORY has great special effects  ,  and the MOVIE_STORY is positive  .   I admit to being a  MOVIE_CAST  fan  ,  as well as Disney fan  ,  which is what motivated me to go see the movie in the theater  .

I know family movies are not the money maker studio's want and it appears audiences are content swallowing MOVIE_STORY less MOVIE_SCENE flicks  ,  but Tomorrowland is a nice diversion from garbage spit into the cinema world like smoke from a factory pipe  .    MOVIE_CAST  is perfect for this part more than I have seen him since The Descendents  .   The kids are great  ,  and don't take that for granted look at Hayden Christiansen or Andrew Garfield  .   The environmental tone was a bit soap boxy but still was well placed in the MOVIE_STORY and relevant  ,  very much like Mr  .   Andersen's speech to Morpheus in the Matrix  .   A few slow moments on the road trip but it had nice moments  .  Overall a real great film for kids to step into a larger MOVIE_STORY movie that has good characters  ,  MOVIE_STORY  ,  and MOVIE_SCENE without the wanton destruction  ,  foul language  ,  sexual innuendo  ,  or forced comic relief  .   One of the best family movies I seen since the Incredibles  ,  nice repeat  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   .   "}, {"review": " I had lot of prejudices  .

MOVIE_CAST  was so mysterious  .    .    .   I'm really waiting for second one !  I think the end kinda hinted about episode 2  .   At the beginning I thought it was gonna be about 1900 century and be super outdated and old - fashioned  ,  but after while it turned to be very modern and ahead of its time  .   I think todays kids will be thrilled about this "}, {"review": " Compared to Other films on right now just by looking at them they look boring but this film was amazing  .   The Walt Disney company have really shown a new side to their film making  .   I highly recommend seeing this film  .   They also related the film very well to the Disney theme parks  .   Just amazing !  !  Maybe just a little slow getting to the Turing point in the MOVIE_STORY but all the characters were amazing  .   Love how they put the New Yorks world fair in at the start of the film to give us an idea of what might happen  .   Along with the world famous theme park attraction \"it's a small world\" which is the gateway into tomorrow land  .

MOVIE_CAST   ,  a cute 12 year old British actress stars as a robot girl and holds the team together  .   They work together to get to Tomorrowland  .

I am a big Disney fan because they make cleaner movies that are family oriented so perhaps I am biased  .   I would recommend this move to anyone that can allow themselves to be immersed into a fiction and not critical of every little detail  .

The basic gist is that something can be done and to just look for a solution rather than be defeatist  .   That is all the movie is supposed to represent  .   It does not advocate anything besides optimism which can go a long  ,  long way  .   So great movie  ,  truly  .

The main female character also just magically jumps to all these conclusions to portray herself as really smart but it makes no sense  .   I wouldn't even have minded a 6 hour movie to accommodate their 90 %  long intro  .   It just seems like they started something great  ,  got sick of it and just ended it as fast as possible  .
