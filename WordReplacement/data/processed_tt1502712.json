[{"review": " This movie was awful  .   As a comic book fan I felt like  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  just slapped me in the face by using so very little of the actual comics  .   He basically used the name of a comic I love to get me to see it and then gave me a different movie  .   The casting was awful  ( none of the characters matched their comic counter part  .   They were all too young so of course Reed Richards didn't have gray streaks  ,  who thought it would be a good idea to make a tiny guy the Thing ?   ,  and was it really necessary to make the Storm family have a \"modern home\" ?  That's more of a MOVIE_STORY that would fit in the X - Men )   ,  the origins dragged on for too long  ,  and their origin wasn't even the same !  The Fantastic 4 is supposed to be all about space travel not going to other dimensions  .   That's Dr  .   Strange's territory  .   I walked out of this garbage and got my money back  .   "}, {"review": " Terrible movie as previous reviewer writes the pacing is all wrong the characters are bleh you don't feel any attachment to them with them creating no chemistry  .  The middle section of the movie is drawn out while the climax feels rushed like the director went gosh where running out of time quick rap it up  .   After the recent awesome avenger movies and the Thors this felt like some hacked together 1990s offering  .  The MOVIE_STORY has so many gaps in it with supposedly super smart scientist doing super stupid things and  MOVIE_CAST  playing Mr Fantastic is just a terrible choice he has no screen presence as a leader  .   Wait for DVD or what ever and let it go quietly in to the past   .   "}, {"review": " Just because it's based on Marvel comics doesn't mean it's made by Marvel Studios  .   It's made by FOX  ,  which licensed the rights to the FF characters from Marvel years ago  .   Thus  ,  any comparisons to other MCU films such as the recent Ant - Man are totally meaningless  .   And that is why it's such a mess  .   Marvel had no control over what FOX did with their source material  .  For those not aware  ,  this film was plagued by problems from the start  .   The director was all but banned from the set and editing room in the final stage of production  ,  after which a good deal of the footage was dumped and re - MOVIE_SCENE   .   In the end  ,  it was slapped together by one of the producers and a temporary director  ,  and the results show :  there is a disconnect between the first two acts and the third  .   It's almost like there are two separate movies trying to co - exist  ,  and it doesn't work  .   "}, {"review": " Sorry but this movie misses the mark big time  .   Compared to the 2005 Movie which was perfect  ,  this one is just really bad  .  The MOVIE_STORY is OK but not executed well  .   The characters are not as portrayed in Marvel  .    MOVIE_CAST  B  .    MOVIE_CAST  as Johnny Storm  ,  why ?  Political correctness gone mad  .   Johnny Storm was not a black man  .   MOVIE_CAST  compared to Jessica Alba ?  Well there is no comparison really  .   And Ben Grimm is really just some overdone cgi  ,  nothing compared to  MOVIE_CAST  Chiklis brilliant portrayal in the earlier movies  .

When they cut to one year later  ,  it looks like it could have been five years later  ,  so it made no sense that so much could have changed in the time span of ONE year  .

I went into the theater and the movie started and I couldn't help but think I had wasted money going to this terrible movie  .   The thing was that the trailer actually made the movie look not too bad but in fact it was all a trick to make its money back  .    MOVIE_CAST  was never really the right choice and poorly acted as the super smart Reed Richards  .   The villain was also extremely unconvincing and while the MOVIE_ACTOR wasn't terrible  ,  the character just didn't really fit into the movie very well  .   Lets just hope that Fox decide to sell these characters back to Marvel since they are the only ones who seem to know what to do with their characters  .   One good note about the movie was there was no after credits MOVIE_SCENE so it is possible they might decide to not go on and make a terrible sequel  ( Maybe they might think about teaming up with Marvel like Spider - man has  .   "}, {"review": " At the beginning  ,  i have a lot of expectations for this movie  ,  since the trailer come out i was so exited  .   So  ,  with that kind of trailer you have and idea of the movie  ,  but this time i only got a big disappointment  .   The movie start very slow  ,  it's boring  ,  lack of sense of humor and you star to get tired of the same routine and just waiting for some MOVIE_SCENE or memorable MOVIE_STORY   .   After a 40 minutes of torture  ,  finally something  ,  but the problems come to float  ,  the MOVIE_STORY behind the characters is pointless  ,  dull and the antagonist is not what you expect  .   There are no chemistry between the MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  all of the have their great performance in TV and cinema  ,  but the is no direction or MOVIE_STORY that helps to reinforcement their relationship  .   In conclusion don't waste your money  !  !  !  !  "}, {"review": " I expected so much out of this movie  ,  since I grew up loving the first Fantastic 4  .   First of all  ,  the movie was way too fast paced  .   Boom  ,  they get their powers  ,  and a year later they go and fight Victor  ,  and then it's over  .   They tried to push Susan and Reed together with barely any development  .   Johnny Storm  .    .   was that even him ?  Barely cocky  ,  arrogant  ,  humorous  .   And at the end they tried pushing the love / hate relationship between Johnny and Ben  .   I expected the movie to end right when they defeated Victor  .   That's how abrupt and short this movie was  .   There were too many gaps  ,  not enough development  ,  unlike the first Fantastic 4  .   John  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   ,  you could have done better  .   Plus  ,  Ben was barely showing any signs of insecurity  .   He basically said  ,  \"What happened to me ?  I don't like it  ,  can you change me ?  OK thanks  .  \" I didn't feel sad for him like I should have  .   "}, {"review": " After the last FF4  ,  you would hope they could at least improve on this  ,  especially with a good cast and Matthew Vaughan on board  ( after saving X - men )   ,  hopes were high  .   For the opening hour or so  ,  all was looking good  ,  the MOVIE_STORY was developing  ,  a little bit of a wobble after they gained their powers  ,  but the MOVIE_STORY picked up again and looked like it had a strong foundation to continue with  .    .    .    .    .    .    .  then it crashed into a crescendo of diabolical MOVIE_STORY  ,  acting and MOVIE_SCENE  ,  that was an insult to the viewers and cinema as a whole  .   It started so well  ,  but felt like they for the last twenty minutes  ,  they decided to test the theory that if you put infinite monkeys in a cage with typewriters  ,  they would recreate Shakespeare  .    .    .    .    .    .  Instead they employed 20 monkeys  ,  who proceeded to soil themselves  ,  throw it at each other  ,  but produced a MOVIE_STORY MOVIE_STORY  ,  that would have embarrassed a straight to VHS 1980 B - movie "}, {"review": " No MOVIE_STORY  ,  No character development  ,  full of pathetic lines and MOVIE_ACTOR  .   The 10 year old version was way better than this crap  .   Its so slow and so bad !  you feel like why why did they spend so much money in making this stupid movie !  This movie has nothing  .   There is not even a single MOVIE_SCENE which I could appreciate  .   The way they they get their superpowers !  and the villain  .   I cant seem to understand why he would want to destroy the earth  .   He has the superpower like jean Grey of Xmen killing people via telepathy  .   But he couldn't use it rather didn't use it on any of the so called f *  *  *  *  *  *  4  .   And the worst is  .   How they pick their names at the and of the movie   .   I felt like pulling my hair out !  Please DO NOT watch this movie !  The Fantastic four ( 2005 )  or the rise of the silver surfer  -  I would rate them 10 if compared to this movie  .   "}, {"review": " Scientist Reed Richards has discovered the secrets of interdimensional travel and with a group of friends goes into another dimension  .   However something goes wrong and when they return they discover that they all have different powers  .   One of Marvel's best comics gets the movie treatment  .   The 3rd movie after the 2005 Fantastic Four movie and the 2007 sequel Rise Of The Silver Surfer and 4th if you count the so bad it was never officially released 1994 film  .   For some reason the Fantastic Four just doesn't translate well to the screen  .   A decent cast  ,   MOVIE_CAST  Tellar  ,   MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST  B  MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST  are all OK and the film livens up after a painfully slow start and there is a decent scifi film struggling to get out but it isn't anything remotely like the original comics  .   Time for Fox to give the rights back to Marvel !  An Insult to Comic Fans  !  !  "}, {"review": " I had a terrible experience watching this  .   One of the worst super - hero movies of recent times !  There's no passion in acting  ,  and the MOVIE_STORY  ,  lord  ,  horrible !  As some said  ,  they ever can do a reboot  .   Some details of the characters and the essence of the comics are completely unrecognizable here  .   I didn't understood the proposal of the director to change that way the origins of team members  .   As a fan of comics  ,  this did not pleased me after all  .   The  MOVIE_SCENE  proposal of the movie is quite interesting  ,  but  ,  unfortunately boring and simplistic  .   There are nothing on the clothes that can be called \"fantastic\" ;  there are no identity on them  .   Somehow they tried to move away the most of what we'd seen in comics and previous adaptations  .   On the one hand they were successful in doing so  ,  secondly  ,  they failed miserably in the producing of a good movie  .   "}]
