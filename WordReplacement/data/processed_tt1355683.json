I am kind of a fan of Bulger's for some sick reason and I felt like  MOVIE_CAST  was appropriately menacing and weird looking and did a good job with making the Violence believable  .   What failed was the MOVIE_STORY  .   There is never really any attention paid to why Whitey was Whitey or how he got to be Whitey or why he wanted to be Whitey  .   His kid is dead his marriage ruined and he is just accumulating money to accumulate money ?  Why ?  He apparently has no vices to speak of except giving money to con men from the IRA  .   The whole thing just makes no sense  .   The whole thing just seemed apathetic  .  It could have been a real classic but they fornicated with the puppy yet again  .   It was just  MOVIE_CAST  looking weird and enjoying a WHitey Halloween costume while he strangled hookers and killed informants  .   Thanks Hollywood  .   I suspect you can blame the producers  .

But I stand corrected  ,  his performance as Whitey Bulger is not only terrifying as hell but one of the best performances  MOVIE_CAST  has ever pulled off !  This is the type of the film that makes you want more and more after each MOVIE_SCENE is done all the way towards the end  ,  and the supporting characters really help Black Mass reach its full potential of hitting the right spots for a moviegoer  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  did an amazing job in this biopic he also she be up for best director  ,   MOVIE_CAST  steals the spotlight in some scenes and bloody nails it in all the screen time he gets  .

How did he become who he is  ,  whats his motivation ?  None of this is answered in the film  .   I think it was simply too big of a MOVIE_STORY to tell in 2 hours so they cut out any background or emotional MOVIE_STORY lines and simply left the more \"exciting\" murders and crimes  .   The acting was average  .   Nothing stood out as being exceptional or cringy  ,  though the characters seemed one dimensional  .

Recently  ,  The Departed touched on similar ground  ,  with Jack Nicholson's character actually being inspired by the real - life Whitey Bulger  ,  but Black Mass gives us the full MOVIE_STORY  .   MOVIE_CAST  gives a great performance as Whitey  ,  all too often he's dismissed lately as a 'gimmicky' MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  but once again he proves he can deliver in a grown - up movie  .

If you like Goodfellas  ,  Casino  ,  Donnie Brasco etc  ,  this isn't either this is black mass  .   personally i friggin loved it  .

I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theatre I would of been bummed out  .   Very underwhelming  .   There was a lot of fight scenes and killing which is always nice  .

I never met a person that had a movie quality life  ,  it is all Hollywood and they did a great job with this one  .   rent it and buy it if you're a gangster aficionado  .   The movie starts off with a good MOVIE_STORY line and starts to roll uphill into the American dream for anyone bold enough to grab on to it  .   You can say that the business gave him the strength and just like politics it kept getting bigger and bigger where there where loyalist helping him to become the one crime family that they can control  .

Acting is satisfactory  ,  but by the end of the movie it didn't matter  .   The movie was a mild bore  .   Moreover  MOVIE_CAST 's performance is decent  ,  but overrated  ,  and the MOVIE_SCENE is unoriginal  -  this is no \"Goodfellas\"  .   There is little surprising  ,  interesting  ,  or fresh ;  and the movie just ends on an epilogue note  .

Yes it is true that his acting was good  .   In fact  ,  it was the best of  MOVIE_CAST 's acting for a long time  .   But I don't see any reason why the Academy should nominate him for best leading MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  considering that the movie didn't force him to be great  .   The MOVIE_STORY was not hard at all  .   It was well written though  ,  and the cinematography was OK  .   The rest of the cast was good as well  ,  since they were almost all great MOVIE_ACTOR  .   I would say this movie is fun to watch  ,  but in my opinion it should have more MOVIE_SCENE and explicit torture  ,  since this was a movie about a Gang  .

Not because of the MOVIE_STORY -  line but  ,  how the way the MOVIE_STORY is being told  .  Overall  ,  \"Black Mass\" sets its' goal high and in some ways it gets there as the cast  ,  cinematography  ,  director and the production company are all in with the same vision  .

I do think  MOVIE_CAST  is really fantastic though  .   The trailers for this film made it seem a lot different than it was  ,  and I remember thinking  MOVIE_CAST  looked to be trying too hard there  .   He was mighty impressive  ,  totally inhabiting that character and proving that yes  ,  he still has it and he needs to stop making bad films  .   The film around him  ,  even if with an impressive cast  ,  was just sort of there  .   I'm not huge on the gangster flick but most at least make me feel something  .

Films based on true events are usually enthralling and pull you into it if they are well written and this was an example of great MOVIE_STORY coupled with good directing  .   The Acting was out of this world  ,  i mean  MOVIE_CAST  always pulls an audience but this was a much different role to his normal acting parts and he was the best  .

And while some may think it moves slow  ,  etc  .   this movie is an accurate depiction of Whitey Bulger's life as one of America's most notorious gangsters  .   Remember 'The Departed ? ' As you may know  ,  it was 'loosely based' upon Bulger  -  although many facts were altered  .   The reason why :  Whitey hadn't been caught by the FBI  .   Martin Scorsese didn't have the stones to use Whitey's name  .   He called Jack Nicholson 'Frank Costello  , ' aka the crime boss in New York  ,  circa 1950  .   Whitey was finally captured in Santa Monica in 2011 by the Fed's  .   It was only after he was behind bars for life did anyone DARE make a true to life movie based upon him  .   Can anyone blame Scorsese or anyone else ?  Whitey was a ruthless  ,  cold - blooded killer  .   Black Mass shows this in fine detail  .   In my opinion  ,  while 'Mass' isn't 'Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' quality  ,  if you know and follow gangster movies as I do  ,  'Black Mass' is most certainly in my Top 10  .

I hope  MOVIE_CAST  will be nominated for a Oscar  .   "}, {"review": " Loved this movie  .   I was concerned that \"Hollywood\" might have over -  dramatized the events and the people involved  ,  but they did not  .   After a bit of background checking on my part  ,  I would have to say that if anything  ,  Hollywood likely did not include all the gory details of Jimmy Bulger's life and crime spree  !  !  This is also no \"glorification\" of any of the events that occurred  ,  just a straight forward detailing of crime and corruption in Boston in the 70's and 80's  .    MOVIE_CAST  is almost unrecognizable  -  so I suspect Oscar will be looking for him  !  !   MOVIE_CAST  does a great turn as a Senator and politico  .   If there is one character in the MOVIE_STORY I would feel sorry for  ,  it is John Connolly  ,  the FBI agent who uses his old school connections with the Bulgers to feather his own nest  !  !  He should have known that crime doesn't pay  ,  and the bad guys always get caught  -  maybe not right away  -  but they always get caught  !  !  "}, {"review": " Great Movie !   MOVIE_CAST  never disappoints me  .   His acting was outstanding  .   Lots of Violence  ,  great MOVIE_STORY  ,  defiantly worth buying  .   After watching this film you will want to read more about Whitey Bulger and look into his incredible success in south Boston  .   What i liked most about this film is  MOVIE_CAST 's transformation through the film from the beginning to the end  .   Trust was a major problem with  MOVIE_CAST  and dealing with it in this film defiantly grabs the audiences attention  .   This being a true MOVIE_STORY is also a major key in the motion picture because it brings the viewers closer into the film  .   This movie was an obvious hit in my opinion and I'm always amazed with  MOVIE_CAST 's performance  .   "}]
