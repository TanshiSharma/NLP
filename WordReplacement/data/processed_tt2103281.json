[{"review": " I loved the first part  .   It was fun  .   So  ,  naturally my expectations for the second movie was high  .   That  ,  and a metascore of 88 on the first day  ,  naturally  ,  I expected a masterpiece  .   But what i saw was just awful  .   The first few scenes have no MOVIE_STORY ues  ,  it's all sign language  ,  with a bit of monkey  MOVIE_MUSIC  here and there ( 60 %  of the film  ,  actually )   .   That puts you to sleep right away  .   There are no awe inspiring scenes  ,  not one frame of amazing  MOVIE_SCENE s  .   The \"emotions\"  ,  well  ,  didn't work for me  .  Story ?  Okay  .   Humans want to repair a dam nearby so that they can get electricity  ,  Caesar allows them to work  ,  and asks other monkeys to help  .   Meanwhile  ,  mean monkey Koba goes to Human place and sees a bunch of weapons  .   So  ,  it comes back  ,  attempts to kill Caesar and then starts a war with the humans  .   Climax ?  Meh  .  Sincere advice  ,  don't watch this  .   Franco and the cute little monkey  ,  in the first part entertained me  .   This one put me to sleep  .

The only interesting character in the film was Coba  ,  when he acted the fool in the armory  .   The rest were just family - values people trying to be good  .   The lead MOVIE_ACTOR was dull  ,  and why was  MOVIE_CAST  cast as a military commander with his squeaky voice  -  it actually broke like a teenager's when he was giving commands  .  So much of it was predictable  ,  and you just knew it was going to end with a punch up  .   Almost gave up half way through  .  I really don't want to say much more  .   Totally inferior to Rise and a great disappointment  .   "}, {"review": " I love Christopher Nolan  ,  He has simply changed the way superhuman  , extraordinary thrillers are made  .   Now everyone is just following him  .   Most of the Directors are trying to show the dark and more realistic environment in the movies and MATT REEVES succeeded in it  .  It is a extremely well - made and enacted movie  .   What works is the intensity of the characters  .   Caesar is the character taken straight out of the last installment  ,  Rise of the Planet of the apes  .   He is the brains and the brass together  .   The movie is entertaining and includes a surprising MOVIE_STORY  .  The film has got some amazing  MOVIE_SCENE s  .   The Apes look real and in every way you sympathize with them  .   I would rate it 9 out of 10 just for  MOVIE_SCENE s  , acting and the intensity of the film  .  DO WATCH  !  !  "}, {"review": " This film is fun and exciting the whole way through  .   I'm not gonna lie  ,  I was skeptical of this film going in  ,  but just like guardians of the Galaxy the way this film makes you feel for the animals is incredible  .

With all the good reviews and people raving about this film however  ,  I thought well I'll give this franchise another MOVIE_SCENE   ,  and boy was it worth it  .

And from the 1000 +  people from the human settlement  ,  for the second expedition they chose the same driver who killed the first ape to begin with  .   How stupid is that ?

If you want a good apes dose watch the Chuck Heston version !  What a waste of money goes into this CGI dribble  .   I wonder what's going on in Hollywood  .   I love movies but it seems that most movies are remakes of the stuff I grew up with in the 70's and 80's  .   Where is the creativity ?  Obviously if these remakes generate revenue  .    .  you have a fairly simple formula to make cash  .    .    .   go with what was popular and cast trendy stars  .

Jason Clarke is also great in this film and he's another underrated MOVIE_ACTOR and Toby Kebbell as Koba is another great thing into this movie too bad that he had to play Dr  .

Another thing about the special effects in the film  ,  in Rise of the Planet of The Apes although that film had great special effects  ,  there were some parts that you could tell were CGI while in Dawn  ,  you couldn't tell if it was motion capture or CGI puppets  .   You literally feel like you are looking at apes  .   Anyways  ,  the MOVIE_STORY is great  ,  it had some awesome MOVIE_SCENE  ,  this film didn't disappoint me at all  .

This one was light on the MOVIE_SCENE and focused more on MOVIE_STORY with conflicts igniting within the human world as well as the ape world  .   Basically it was about united we stand  ,  divided we fall  ,  for both sides  .   With that in mind I think the more advanced the apes get in the films the more like humans they become  ,  and not in a good way and I think that is what Ceasar  ,  the leader of the apes  ,  is going to start realizing  .   I think this film is just setting the stage for a third installment of the new \"Planet of the Apes\" motif anyway  .   So if there is another installment of the \"Planet of the Apes\" theme  ,  hopefully there will be lots of MOVIE_SCENE in it  ,  but like I said before  ,  this is a good film it just wasn't as exhilarating as the first  .

What's scarier than the animal kingdom  ,  or specifically our ancestors rising up in a war between the species  .   Probably a lot of things but I still found it quite frightening  .   I think the scariest thing for me was that the apes began to take on bad human traits  .   Committing acts for survival is greatly different from seeking power and MOVIE_STORY  .   I'm used to it with humans but I expect better from animals  .  The one thing I can't get my head around is even after a decade of living in a post apocalyptic wasteland the humans still had a plentiful supply of automatic weapons and ammo  .   The only thing guns are good for is conflict and it's pretty weak for the creators to rely solely on them to instil fear  .  Overall the movie really could have been better  .

In this movie a good measure of James Bond and Rambo are mixed into the Planet of the Apes universe in order to make it more of an MOVIE_SCENE thriller  .   This mixture proved to be successful at the box office and at the same time made this movie indiscernible from any other contemporary MOVIE_SCENE movie  .  There are some very nice moments within the apes' community  ,  but they get squandered with the aforementioned mixture  .  So  ,  if you're looking for a \"different\" MOVIE_SCENE movie  ,  you've found what you've been looking for  .

There are a few messages that the movie tries to impart  .   The most important message for me was  :  You have to forget the past  .   We as individuals and communities must learn to forget the wrongs of the past to create a good future  .   Other lesson is that no community is good or bad  .   It is individuals that are good or bad  .   Different communities can live together  .   Also what stands out are the leadership qualities of the leader of apes  .   If every leader would think so much about their people and peace at large we would have a different world  .   Overall a very well made movie with mix of great MOVIE_STORY line  ,  good moral lessons  ,  MOVIE_SCENE  ,  CGI etc  .   Must watch  .   "}, {"review": " The original Planet of the Apes based on the novel by Pierre Boulle  ,  was poignant and allegorical  .   Shocking !  Dawn of the Planet of the Apes captures the original spirit of the movie by presenting a powerful allegory of ethnic conflict  .   Of us  & amp ;  them  .   Of how easily diplomacy can spiral out of control and spark racial unrest  .   A very thought provoking update to the franchise that makes it absolutely 100 %  relevant to today  .   Sci - fi at its best !  Not the huge summer blockbuster I was anticipating  .   But still Dawn of the Apes will surely please all with some epic battle sequences and MOVIE_SCENE scenes  .   In a summer of blockbusters with contrives scripts and MOVIE_STORY holes Dawn of the Apes is a relief and a pleasure !  "}, {"review": " When I watched the Rise of the Planet of the Apes  ,  I was pleasantly surprised about how good that movie was  .   It had exemplary display of emotions and brilliant cgi with a strong MOVIE_STORY  .   By the end of the movie  ,  it left a viewer asking for more  .  Almost 3 years later  ,  comes its sequel  .   This one however does not live up to its expectations  .   The setting is more darker  ,  with the apes now living as a small community under thatched roofs in the redwoods  .   Their peaceful life gets interrupted when humans trespass their home  ( the woods )   .   If the first one was about apes getting intelligent and smarter  ,  with Caesar wanting a home for them in the woods  ,  the second one is grim with anger  ,  MOVIE_STORY  ,  war and bloodshed  .   As in the first one  ,  Caesar is the center of attraction of the movie  .   The performance capture and modern technological advances are well used  .   In summary  ,  good for a watch or two ;  but not as brilliant as the first one  .   "}, {"review": " Ridiculously stupid idea  .   This movie took me to the times when I was a kid  & amp ;  watched movies like the power rangers depicting the human race like a -  holes who can't do anything at all  & amp ;  there is this evil monster who wants to eat all of them  .   Half of the movie was OK but then suddenly I see an evil ape riding a horse with two guns laughing like a lunatic  ,  seriously  ,  I started to laugh in the cinema  ,  it no longer appeared as a serious movie  .   All I saw humans do was just act like zombies  ,  I could just not digest the idea of seeing the human race so helpless far from reality  & amp ;  so far below in intelligence from talking apes  .   Its not the 1980s !  !  A typical 1980s movie where all humans do in movies is run for their lives "}, {"review": " The movie briefs the two ways of living with Man and Apes in the first half  .   The Apes are isolated themselves in the forest from the humans colonized  .   The humans in abandoned cities with decreasing resources day by day  .   When it happens when some man happens to enter the forest and make contact to the Apes one shoots down one of the ape in panic  .   The leader of the Ape has family values and peace on top of the rivalry and sends them back  .   The MOVIE_STORY begins there and travels through a series of events involving trust and Anti trust between humans vs apes and also within the same species  .  The second half keeps you occupied with the MOVIE_SCENE sequences but there is no suspense element of what will happen next in the movie that will keep the audience in the edge of the seat  .   With especially betraying clever traitor Koba on the characters it could have been any way the MOVIE_STORY could have been taken but it was taken in a very predictable way  .   There was some intelligence in the climax making path for the sequel   .   "}]
