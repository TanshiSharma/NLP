[{"review": " I really don't understand all the hate this movie gets  .   Yeah  ,  I get it  ,  it's a reboot of a perfectly good 80s movie that nobody really wanted  ,  but it's a really good one !  I expected a mindless Micheal Bayian MOVIE_SCENE movie and what I got was a really smart  ,  interesting and entertaining look at trans - humanism  ,  the freedom of choice  ,  politics and recklessness in corporate leaders  .  This movie really dives into the question of how a person could live his day to day live with almost all of his body amputated and stuck inside of a machine  .   So when people complain about the uncomfortable scenes between Murphy and his wife  ,  I can only imagine they mean what happened after his transformation  ,  and that felt exactly the way it was supposed to ! So yes  ,  the original is way more  MOVIE_SCENE  and still holds up to this day as a gruesome MOVIE_SCENE flick  ,  but this one is smart and interesting and really is a good movie in it's own right  .  And by no means is it as bad as people say it is !  "}, {"review": " I love Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop from 1987  ( which remains iconic )  and I usually don't like reboots  .   But watching the new one I never got rid of the feeling  ,  that the remake is worth it  .   It is a whole new interpretation  ,  that sets the focus on the topics of our time :  robots  ,  drones  ,  the human aspect behind the technology  ,  media critics  ,  war propaganda  .   I felt  ,  the movie has a mission to enlighten people and I liked that  .   It became even more obvious how much the RoboCop MOVIE_STORY exists within the topos of Frankenstein which is the MOVIE_STORY about the human devilment and the lack of respect of life  .   That's why  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  gives Murphy more of a face  ,  a life and feelings  .  Beside that the pictures  ,  the  MOVIE_MUSIC   ,  the MOVIE_MUSIC is pretty contemporary  .   You probably have to make some compromises today to get the millions to get the flick done  .   It won't become iconic  ,  but it's the right time for the right message in the right movie  .

It's well - executed and the direction was clear and crisp  .   There's no distinct feel - good MOVIE_SCENEscenes because the pacing is kept constant throughout and I don't see why there's an issue with the pacing being that way  .   It's hardly flat  ,  it's just a very honest  ,  straight -  flushed MOVIE_STORY - telling  ,  and it fits the themes that are underscored by the movie  .   Alex Murphy is a reluctant hero and he's ultimately a father and a husband whose personal agenda serves as his existential core  .   I like how these themes are teased out and zoomed in upon throughout the movie  .   Also  ,  there are some absolutely delicious production details and CGIs that are just absolutely feasts to the eye  .   Not to mention the superb cast and the wonderful performances  .   I think this is a honest and loyal reboot that will appeal to fans of Robocop who fell in love with the MOVIE_STORY precisely for the moralistic themes it explores  .   "}, {"review": " I just don't see  ,  why any other recent science fiction movie deserves more respect than this one  .   The MOVIE_STORY is fluent  ,  the characters are well built  ,  everyone has its own motive  .   Yes film is more of a personal struggle journey of the main character and that is what I like  .   For the fans of MOVIE_SCENE it is also good  ,  why when  ( quite often )  there is  ,  it is good one  .   The effects are quality mastership  .   The most memorable MOVIE_SCENE is when Murphy sees what he has become  .  For my regards it has some philosophical connotation to  ,  because it also concerns the influence of technology to the society  .   It clearly shows bads and goods  .   I recommend watching this movie for "}, {"review": " Before I went to go see it  ,  I already knew it couldn't compete with the original  .   But this actually was worse than I expected  .   What was great about the original just like Terminator is that it was grimy  ,  dark and although robot cops offcourse aren't that realistic they we're not beyond belief  .  This pushes everything  ,  RoboCop has to weigh at least a couple of hundred kilo's but it runs like Usain Bolt  .   The way it jumps could easily make him a star NBA player  .   If you are a fan and actually wanted to believe this could be real  ,  this alone ruins it completely  .  Then there are the \"let's - make - him - modern - and - cool\" errors  .   Why paint him black  ,  he's not Batman  .   Why does his visor light up red  ,  he's not Cyclops and he has thermal vision so  ,  he doesn't need a light  .   Why does he have to recharge at least 10 times during the movie  ,  did Apple make him ? The Human Hand Pffff  ,  Why GOD why ?  Taser The original Robocop had part off his awesomeness because of the automatic Desert Eagle  .   Everyone wanted that gun  .   This one has a taser  .   A taser  ,   .    .    .   really ?

But Murphy has his own mind  ,  which leads to conflict with those responsible for the attempt on his life  ( plus others )   ,  which may stretch beyond the criminal fraternity  .  The 2014 remake of Paul Verhoeven's classic 1987 sci - fi satire includes most of the MOVIE_STORY beats from the original  ,  but has quite a different heart  .   This makes it into a different film  ,  and one which I enjoyed as much as the original  .  Despite being full of MOVIE_SCENE  ,  it is a much gentler film  .   The MOVIE_SCENE is not as sadistic  ,  there is no profanity  ( imagine that !  )   ,  the relationship between Alex and his family is much more important  ,  and  MOVIE_CAST 's conflicted Dr Frankenstein  -  sorry  ,  Dr Norton  -  is a fine character :  he is the actual heart of the movie  .

It seemed to me like this had more of a MOVIE_STORY and we got to know the main character more before he even became Robocop  .   The CGI in this film was impressive and I thought Robocop looked bad - ass in black  .   The films builds up nicely and the MOVIE_SCENE sequences towards the end are pretty breathtaking  .

To be honest  ,  when they stripped away all of the robotic suit and showed Murphy what remained of him  ,  I a bit shocked and kind of disgusted  .   However  ,  it was not in the whiny protesting way  ,  but rather the \"oh gods  ,  I just saw an animal get hit by a bus\" shocked  .   That image of pulsating guts and organs was rather grisly  .

The CEO was an excellent parody of marketing - as - product  ( Steve Jobs  *  * cough *  *  )   ,  but the TV talking head was not convincing  -  although that kind of nutty ranting is a good target  .

Also  ,  how can you go wrong with cast including  MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST  and Samuel Jackson  .   I've seen new version couple times and plan on watching many more  .

I can't watch this recent movie without comparing it to the original  .   The original movie is a Cult classic and should have been left alone in my humble opinion  .   In this Robocop Universe I got the feeling that Robocop wasn't needed as it was for instance in the original movies  .   In the original version the cops are out maned  ,  out gunned and overburdened with bureaucracy and legal tape to fight crime  .   In this I agree the special effects are awesome but the MOVIE_STORY in lacking something substantial in the MOVIE_STORY  .

Why movie makers agree to these poor remakes is beyond me  .   Watch this if you want to but suggest you do so before the original  .   Original is a far superior movie  .

Thats why people should always remember not to believe everything which is advertised and shouldn't give them to much power / control  .

More billions of course  ,  and he will stop at nothing to get it  .   Omnicorp did about everything they could to try to convince the American people that they should have androids patrolling the streets and they pretty much destroyed Murphy and his family's life to reach their goal  .  The movie's main goal is not about MOVIE_SCENE or things blowing up it's about the insatiable greed of corporate America  .   Oh and Samuel Jackson brought his usual flair to this movie as well  .   "}, {"review": " Its understandable the first part being slow and steady to give all proper meaning why Robocop is being made and then MOVIE_SCENE   .   But MOVIE_SCENE and chase being done just one way by Robocop and shown less was not good as film makers should have devoted more time showing the capabilities of Robocop a lot more  ,  and I felt it was shown all too fast   .   Loved some thrilling MOVIE_SCENE scenes and good different MOVIE_STORY   .   As I am a big Robocop Indian fan so I will give one extra rating as film makers made the effort to bring him back after so long !  So big thanks to them and would highly appreciate the second part very soon as there should be one for more different MOVIE_SCENE to be done by him with more plotting and MOVIE_STORY  ,  with better looks of the Robocop suit   .   "}, {"review": " The new RoboCop is a surprisingly good and entertaining sci - fi MOVIE_SCENE thriller that appeals to the human heart by conveying emotions and the humanity side of Murphy  ,  the main character who eventually becomes the titled cyborg law enforcer  ,  ROBOCOP  .   Though the MOVIE_STORY will take expected turns and even if you know how the movie is going to end  ,  Robocop is a must watch for some amazing  MOVIE_SCENE s  .   Though once can easily tag this an MOVIE_SCENE or sci - fi movie  ,  one can not neglect emotional aspects of the film  .    MOVIE_CAST  has played the Robocop nicely  ,  balancing between human 'strength' and machine's 'emotions'  .   Yeah  ,  I get it  ,  it's a reboot of a perfectly good 80s movie that nobody really wanted  ,  but it's a really good one !  Though there is no suggestion towards end about Robocop2  ,  I'm sure there will a sequel soon !  !  My rating  -  7  .  5 / 10 "}, {"review": " This director has no idea who is robocop  , all of the new cast has ruined the 1987 unique production  , I am so disappointed to see the hero of my childhood movie that I was watching 60 times a month in this remake  , I wish I was the director  , I would have done better !  !  The start has no clear MOVIE_STORY about the cop  .   Big part of the movie especially in the middle of it was very boring !  The end of the movie was so bad  .   You get out of the theatre feeling something was very missing  , something wasn't right  .   The movie will be making a very good profit for sure only because of its name and people got tricked thinking they are going to watch an interesting entertaining remake  .   Also most of the people that they are going to watch it are the fans of the original movie and they will for sure be very disappointed  .   Be sure all of the good reviews are from people that do not know who is Peter weller and have not seen the great performance in the original robocop  .  not only the performance but the directing skills and the scenes sequence  .   The bottom line \"This remake needs a remake !  ! \" "}]
