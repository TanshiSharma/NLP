[{"review": " Brilliant adaptation of the MOVIE_STORY of Bletchley Park and the cryptanalysis team  ,  ran by Alan Turing  ,  that cracked the code of the German Enigma Machine during World War II  .   Featuring an outstanding starring performance from  MOVIE_CAST  as war hero Turning and supporting acts from a brilliant cast including  MOVIE_CAST   ,  Charles Dance and Mark Strong  ,  'The Imitation Game' is a powerful and eminently well - made biopic that illuminates the facts whilst respecting the MOVIE_STORY it is based upon  .   The English - language debut of 'Headhunters' director  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   ,  this British World War II thriller is a highly conventional MOVIE_STORY about humanity that creates a fascinating character  ,  anchored by a hypnotically complex performance  .

Excellent MOVIE_STORY and delivery  .   It was well received at TIFF 14 where it was named People's Choice  .   The cast members really gelled on screen  .   It was well edited because the pace of the movie did not lag at any time  .   When watching this you will quickly realize that these MOVIE_ACTOR  (  MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST   ,  Mark Strong  ,   MOVIE_CAST  )  will be around for a long time entertaining us  .   If you like A Beautiful Mind or even Good Will Hunting  ,  you will enjoy this  .   It comes out in November 2014  .   Don't miss it  .   This one is Oscar worthy  .

Wartime Britain is depicted vividly  ,  if a little caricatured  ,  with an autumnal palette and a jaunty air  .  A true MOVIE_STORY  ,  sympathetically told  ,  with good performances all round and a stand - out Turing from the indefatigable Mr  MOVIE_CAST   .   The young Turing is also extremely well realised by Alex Lawther  .  Meandering through Alan Turing's life since school until shortly before his death  ,  the MOVIE_STORY demands your attention and regularly makes you smile  .  Highly recommended  .   "}, {"review": " This is THE movie for anyone who wants to learn about the birth of all modern computing and cryptography  .   It also provides a deep commentary on the ignorance of people who hate those who do not fit in  .   I wish the film could have gone into more detail about Alan Turing after the war when his deepest personal struggles were in full force  .   However  ,  for a theatrical film it would have been far too long  .   This film illustrates how far we have come as a society in terms of accepting gay and lesbians and their contributions to society  .   I will not spoil the film but for the cypherpunks out there you will be a little uneasy if you compare the MI - 6 tactics to those of today's NSA and other three letter agencies that spy on our every digital move  .   All in all a brilliant film with great MOVIE_ACTOR that will move your hearts and minds  .   "}, {"review": " It is a shame this movie is a stack of lies  .  First time polish broke enigma it was in 1932  ,  1933 they created first working example of Enigma  ,  and first anti - enigma device  ,  narrowing settings combination to 105 456  .   In 1936 Germans changed the design  ,  and Polish answered with Rejewsky bomb  ,  machine with 6 enigma connected together  , breaking new daily code in 2 hours  .  Another German changes required building 54 different machine designs  ,  and Poland didn't have enough money so they asked allies to help  .  July 1939 Uk and French representatives visited Warsaw and got all documentation how to break ENIGMA  .  After beginning of the war  ,  polish encoders moved to Paris  ,  and British started Bletchley Park operation  .   Unfortunately  ,  Polish people are always forgotten  ,  because they are not part of US / UK / France / Germany nation  .  Shame on you Britain  .

While I have been more firmly opposed than most to boarding school bullying  ,  in this case  ,  the nobler the goal  ,  the worse the MOVIE_STORY  .   The film tries unsuccessfully to make Turing both a friendless quasi - autistic lone genius  ,  and the head of the entire decryption project ;  neither point has any relation to reality  ,  and barely cohere to each other  .    ( I admit to some bitterness about this slur on my grand -  supervisor  ,  since it implicitly denies the existence of my graduate - school supervisor  .   ) The film also does disservice to Joan Clarke's genuine contributions  ,  substituting a muddled and completely ahistorical subplot about her professional dependence on  ,  and mathematical superiority to  ,  Turing  ,  while seeming more concerned with her appearance than her intellect  .

BUT  -  German military texts enciphered on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau  ,  beginning in December 1932  .   This success was a result of efforts by three Polish cryptologists  ,  Marian Rejewski  ,  Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki and Henryk Zygalski  ,  working for Polish military intelligence  .   Alan devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers  ,  including improvements to the pre - war Polish bombe method  .   Shame Polish Intelligence was omitted in the movie  .   "}, {"review": " I have just one comment  .   Why is a movie founded on a lie such a huge success and even nominated for an Oscar ?  Alan Turing was not the first guy to crack the code  .   He and others at Bletchley Park were merely the smart folks who used Polish groundbreaking cryptography methods to tackle Enigma  .   Turing is portrayed here as a hero and the success as solely his  ,  all according to the sneaky writers of The Imitation Game  .   Did they forget to carry out a proper research or was their mission to undermine Polish part a deliberate thing ?  Brits often forget about their 2WW allies  ,  ascribing all the war effort success to themselves  .   But hey  ,  even 'bletchleyparkorg'  ,  the official website  ,  says \"The Poles broke Enigma in 1932\"  .    .    .  In 1939 with the invasion on Poland imminent the Poles reached out to Britons for help and thus Bletchley Park became the centre where cryptographers were unscrambling the code  .

FFS sake change the record with this stuff  ,  it got tired a long time ago and it's stinking up so many movies  .

Although the MOVIE_STORY has some glitches  ,  what definitely sells this movie and makes it worth a multiple of view is the brilliant performance of  MOVIE_CAST   .

The difficulty is the character of Turing which is given a portrayal by  MOVIE_CAST  which is one of the finest I have ever seen on screen  .   Turing invented the Turing machine which all modern digital computers have their foundation  , but is Turing actually a machine himself ?  He is almost like DATA from Star Trek  ,  in this very special performance  .   Alex Lawther as young Turing is also absolutely brilliant  .   This life MOVIE_STORY of Turing is shown in three parts  ,  swinging backwards and forwards  .   The only weakness is when we get to the major \"faction\" part of the MOVIE_STORY concerning the Soviet spy John Cairncross  .   Anybody that knows the true MOVIE_STORY concerning Cairncross knows that this interaction with Turing is a load of fiction  .

Ordinary things is boring and wont bring any changes  .    MOVIE_CAST  did a fine job as Alan  ,  from being a curious over the head thinker  ( like he always does in Sherlock )  to an insecure man  .   Oh !

All the characters were well played and the MOVIE_SCENE of the movie is spot on specifically for the WW period  .
