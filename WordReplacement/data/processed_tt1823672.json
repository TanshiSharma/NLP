[{"review": " I thoroughly enjoyed Chappie  .   I usually don't write reviews  ,  but after seeing the brutal rating this movie is getting I felt compelled to write this review  .  Chappie is a funny  ,  entertaining  ,  and surprisingly sentimental movie about a sentient robot being raised by gangsters in Johannesburg  .   Most of the criticisms I've seen about one -  dimensional characters and illogical character choices are valid  ,  but Chappie's character  ,  the CGI  ,  the humor  ,  and the overall aesthetic of the movie more than make up for these shortcomings  .  Please go see this movie and make up your own mind  .   I almost didn't go last night because of the negative reviews  ,  but I'm so happy I did  .   I'm very excited to see this movie again  .   You leave this movie feeling like you've become friends with Chappie  ,  and I hope the bad reviews don't prevent the sequels from being made  .  If you like  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's directing and style you will love this movie  .   "}, {"review": " Don't let the critics who can't seem to get past comparing Chappie with other sci - fi titles put you off of going to see this film  .   This MOVIE_STORY is about a lot more than just robot police officers it is a thought provoking social commentary on many modern day issues and what it is like to bring life into the modern world  .  I very much enjoyed District 9 but I would even go as far to say I enjoyed Chappie much  ,  much more  .  There were so many aspects to this film that could have went wrong but have been nailed on the head by the director  .   The effect once again  MOVIE_SCENE ly striking and a very well paced and intricate development of characters as well as interesting set design helps keep chappie fresh and not just another reboot of any other sci fi film as critics will have you believe  .  I would also say I enjoyed this film much  ,  much more than the likes of robo - cop  .   "}, {"review": " This is not just an excellent and entertaining movie  ,  i found many elements as real / istic and present  ,  it is just touched some  ( maybe )  future elements  .   Neil pulled the maximum out of this MOVIE_STORY and made it unforgettable as District 9 was  .  How ever  ,  my stomach turns upside down when i see the Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes score  ,  these pathetic sites and their brainless people  ( called themselves \"critics\" )  live amongst us with their nonsense and empty headed  ,  braintumored criticism  -  sure  ,  this movie has no Beverly Hills and it's \"amazing\" crowd  ,  no lemonade punch as MOVIE_STORY  ,  no muscle cars and no muscle people  ,  no worldwide threat to the USA and such  .   It has something else to say and this is the core of this amazing movie  .  Afterall  ,  Chappie has Everything that needs for a unique and must - see movie  ,  sure  ,  it is a target for all those  ( disgusting )  critics who expect the everyday boring lemonade with everyday boring MOVIE_ACTOR and actress  .  Shame on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes  ,  you guys are not more  ,  than just rotten and brainless second level scribblers  .   "}, {"review": " Why all the hate for this movie ?  I understand not liking something  ,  but everyone seems to just TRASH it  .   Did I see the same movie ?  I saw an emotional film about innocence and loss  .   I REALLY don't understand  .   Sure  ,  maybe the film didn't have the best MOVIE_STORY ue or the best acting in the world  ,  but it hit home for me  .   The VFX were phenomenal  ,  Chappie is the best CGI motion capture I have seen in a long time  ,  the 100 %  electronic MOVIE_MUSIC score by Hans Zimmer was really unique and fresh  ,  and it has a really great MOVIE_STORY  .   I DON'T UNDERSTAND  .   If you like  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's previous films or are remotely interested  ,  please watch it yourself  .   I think the critics are wrong on this one  .   I have been thinking for a while about why the reviews are so out there  .   First off  ,  the trailers are AWFUL  .   The first to come out was this philosophical \"What does it mean to be human ? \" kinda movie  .   The TV trailers were \"GUNS  ,  EXPLOSIONS  ,  ROBOTS !  !  ! \" and it is neither  .   Think \"Little Miss Sunshine\" with a robot  ,  that is a more accurate representation  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's most underrated film  .   "}, {"review": " This is a great movie definitely in the style of Niell  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   .   However  ,  some people might consider this a fault  ,  as Elysium was a little off the mark  .   What is great about the movie is its style  .   They really went all out with Yolandi and Ninja  ( the main characters part of the MOVIE_MUSIC group Die Antwoord )   .    MOVIE_CAST  is pretty hilarious as a bloodthirsty war vet  ,  selling his role pretty well  .   The technology in this movie is fantastic  ,  as usual coming from  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   ,  leaving plenty of ideas for the imagination to wonder about for the future  .   Of course  ,  Chappie really makes this movie ;  taking something so technical and robotic  ,  making it human in MOVIE_SCENE  .   He really gets the feels going  .   I haven't laughed like that in a movie theater in a long time  .   Add to that the oddness of the characters influencing the development of Chappie  ,  this movie is gangster  .   Still  ,  9 / 10  ,  super great movie  .   "}, {"review": " I liked District 9 and Elysium  ,  so I was really looking forward to Chappie  ,  especially for the special effects that I'd seen in those previous films  .   I felt like Chappie needed to be at least another hour longer to convey the director's message properly  .   There are way too many holes in the MOVIE_STORY to lead to such a thought - provoking MOVIE_STORY  .   I'll say there was sufficient delivery on the special effects  ,  but the MOVIE_STORY was not extensive enough  .   One  -  there's no explanation as to why \"Ninja\" and his mates owe some master criminal millions of dollars ;  two  -  one minute Chappie's being bullied by thugs and the next we're to expect they're loving foster parents ;  and three  -  why would transferring one's \"consciousness\" to another being also carry their voice and accent over ?  I expect a movie to suspend my beliefs for a couple of hours  ,  but a MOVIE_STORY that flows well makes for  $  better spent  .   "}, {"review": " The trailer of the movie talks about the black sheep  ,  that is being different  ,  So I would say this one was the black sheep in the world of sci - fi movies  .  The MOVIE_STORY of a robot  ,  which is being depicted in unbiased manner (  not robot - as - a - monster or robot - as - an - angel movie )  is quiet refreshing  .   The robot Chappie not just marvels you but make you emotional at times  .   So be prepared to get your eyes drenched at times  .   I think these are some of those moments when you feel this is not a sci - fi or MOVIE_SCENE stereotype  ,  but that is what makes it wonderful  .  MOVIE_SCENE cuts are great ( very less of them )   ,  MOVIE_ACTOR have done wonderful job  ( especially the lady who acts as Chappies \"mommie\" ) Loved it  .  P  .  S  .

Couldn't help but think about how true this MOVIE_STORY is :  your child associates with the \"wrong crowd\" and no matter how much you try  ,  what you say  ,  s / he is going down a bad path  .   All you can hope for is that they'll find their real self before it's too late  .    .    .  I usually don't like violent movies  ,  or films about gangsters  ,  druggies  ,  and such  .   This has all these components in it  -  however  ,  it was very clear to me  ,  that I would never  ,  ever want to live in a world as depicted there  .    ( Not like most other movies with these topics  ,  where that attitude towards life is idolized and glorified  .    .    .   ) Never mind what the critics say  ,  watch it yourself  -  what have you got to loose ?  2 hours of your life  .   I think  ,  these 2 hours will be much better spent there  ,  than watching any mainstream TV  .    .    .   "}, {"review": " Got pleasantly surprised that the movie was pretty funny  ,  since we went to see Sci - Fi and humor is not usually what you'd expect  .   At the same time multiple serious things are shown and you wonder  .    .    .   what exactly is consciousness  .    .    .   would it fit on a USB stick  .    .    .   what makes a machine different than us  .    .    .   anything you wanna do in your life you can do  .    .    .   why does a robot wipe his nose  .    .    .   that battery  .    .    .   what's the meaning of life  .    .    .   should I buy a Sony laptop  .    .    .   what will happen next  .    .    .   how cool is it for a robot to have a tattoo  .    .    .   that  MOVIE_MUSIC track  .    .    .   be careful who do you fist bump  .    .    .

So I tried a different tack  .   I am watching because I cannot believe anyone would deliberately make a film this bad with such a stupid MOVIE_STORY and stupid characters and an A - list cast  .   I mean  ,  a character who was carjacked by killers actually tells them that he doesn't want a confrontation  ,  this with a MOVIE_SCENE gun in his face  ,  but he insists on coming back tomorrow to play with his robot  .

From the previous reviews  ,  this appears to be a 'Marmite' film  .   I'm not going to go into a long diatribe  ,  I just found it preposterous  ,  not because of the concept of the film which is following a current trend in near future Ai / robot MOVIE_STORY lines  ,  but because of the almost cartoonish acting  ,  and the disjointed implausible MOVIE_STORY development from start to finish  .   I am a  MOVIE_CAST  fan but I'm afraid this is a turkey for her  ,  and I guess the other main MOVIE_ACTOR will list this film very low down on their CV  .   Anyone that watches this film should then compare it with another recent Ai film ;  'Ex Machina'  ,  which I consider to be a far superior movie on all levels  .   "}, {"review": " The trailer makes this film seem like a really great piece of Sci - Fi  .   Having a very promising MOVIE_STORY by having AI in robots  ,  future police being robots and grasping the surface of the abstract consciousness ;  it's a pity they let Die Antwoord in on this  .   Apart from the great AI MOVIE_STORY properties  ,  the whole film feels like an excuse for Die Antwoord to get their crappy MOVIE_MUSIC in a movie and for them so play cool and \"gansta\" in their old crappy warehouse  .   The movie could very well have left out these idiots for real MOVIE_ACTOR  .   The computers used in the movie seem very outdated and not capable of dealing with AI in a professional way  .   One would think that  ,  for advanced AI programming ;  there would have evolved some more advances interfaces to interact with this phenomenon  .   "}, {"review": " Absolutely Brilliant  .

Wow  ,  kudos to  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  for having such a stark  ,  clear vision of the near future and telling it so well  .   Jo'berg didn't fare too good  ,  hopefully this was CGI  ,  which I never felt aware of anywhere in Chappie  ,  and which has been ruining Sci - Fi for 20 +  years  .   Excessive MOVIE_SCENE for the sake of MOVIE_SCENE  ,  convoluted plots as a substitution for good MOVIE_STORY  .    .    .

I look forward to renting when released on bluray  .   first act was engaging and didn't seem slow or pandering to anyone seeking \"content\"  .   final act of the film keeps you on the edge of your seat !   MOVIE_CAST  does a great job of making us empathize with his character -  Chappie is an endearing  ,  and deep character  .   Another mention - able cast member is Yo - landi Visser  .

Although some scenes in the movie come across as silly  ,  I interpreted it as a warning about over - reliance on technology for law enforcement  .   The South African setting makes sense :  four decades of institutionalized racism gave way to one of the highest crime rates in the developed world  .  In the end  ,  I recommend the movie  .

He is given the choice to turn to MOVIE_SCENE or benevolence  -  different role models teach him with different ways of living  .

Daring  ,  this is a film for which I would be keen to see a sequel which challenges our views on sharing our world and what discrimination could look like in the future if we walk towards technological breakthroughs without our eyes wide open  .

You gotta love that accent from Joburg  .   The MOVIE_STORY itself makes you think if we really need Artificial Intelligence in our lives ?  I honestly think we should leave it like that  .

What I would like to say  ,  however  ,  is that  ,  despite some VERY SERIOUS MOVIE_STORY holes and inconsistencies throughout the movie  ,  this it still a very enjoyable and well made film  .   Let me put it this way  :  if you liked District 9  ,  Bicentennial Man  ,  Robocop  ,  gangster movies or even Iron Man  ,  then you'll have a good time watching Chappie  ,  as it's a mix of all those  .   And while doing a mix is not original  ,  the things that this movie approaches differently  ,  plus the great CGI  ,  will worth watching  .

Chappie is getting and learning things fast as you'd expect and the lines between good and evil blur at times  ,  if not through the whole movie  .

This is an MOVIE_SCENE packed and emotional MOVIE_STORY with the cast doing a great job but the film suffers towards the end with one too many 'Hollywood' touches  .   As a movie about 'consciousness'  ,  it is not as intelligent as 'Ex Machina' which tackles a similar topic  .

It's much like District 9  ,  it shows us a problem that we will have to deal with  .  If you want a movie that will make you think  ,  and shed a few tears  ,  see Chappie  .   Otherwise  ,  save your money and watch Avengers or play Bloodborne  .  Much is made of Die Antwoord as a negative factor in the film  .   If anything  ,  I thought that Yolandi was a very touching mother figure  ,  think Chappie in the bed being read to  .   And Ninja starting out being all bad ass  ,  and then showing his love for Yolandi and coming around to the good  .  All in all  ,  a movie I would  ,  and will  ,  see again  .   "}, {"review": " My expectations for Chappie were relatively high going in and the movie did not disappoint  .   As a huge science fiction fan  ,  I loved this movie  .   The MOVIE_SCENE was excellent  ,  the characters were good  ,  the setting was interesting and it was just an all around good film  .   The character of Chappie is in a way lovable  .   You don't want to see him die or hurt and you feel for him  .   He's just an all around lovable character  .    MOVIE_CAST 's Deon is a good character  ,  he's sorta this mastermind who creates all the robots  .    MOVIE_CAST  as the villain works very well and he is such a bastard you just wanna see him get the hell kicked out of him which he does  .   Ninja and Yolandi were pretty much OK they were very hard to understand at times and i'm really not a fan of Die Antwoord but from what i saw from them they did OK  .   Overall if your a Sci - Fi fan  ,  go see this "}, {"review": " I can say this film is not very original  ,  it's pretty much all those robot films I said in my summary  .   But I'd be lying saying it wasn't entertaining  ,  cause it was  .    MOVIE_CAST  Copely really becomes the character Chappie  ,  embodies him perfectly  .   MOVIE_CAST  is affected has the inventor  ,  who invents the robot Chappie  ,  all his character wanted to do  ,  is create a robot to learn humanity  .   And that is what Chappie is  ,  a child learning to find his place in the world  ,  even though the scenes where he is under bad influence of some criminals  ,  I still cared for Chappie  .    MOVIE_CAST  really shines has the main bad guy  ,  who invents a giant robot  ,  that looks like ED209s ( Robocop )  kid brother  .    MOVIE_CAST  is so evil  ,  you just can't wait to see him get his  .   MOVIE_SCENE scenes are well done  ,  So are the effects  .  If you liked District 9  ,  I'll hope you'll like Chappie  .   "}, {"review": " Chappie himself was a brilliant character beautifully played by  MOVIE_CAST   ,  but he couldn't lift this movie alone  .   Most of the other main characters are well acted  ,  but their character development are close to non existent  .   I had a hard time caring for anyone other than Chappie  .   The biggest downfall is two main characters played by the real hip hop group \"Die antwoord\"  ,  who play them self  ,  in a way  .    .   They are not good MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  they are not interesting  ,  and they had way too much screen time in this movie  .  The MOVIE_STORY was decent  ,  but not as fresh as it could have been  .   It borrowed a lot from other AI movies  ,  and had the potential to do something different  ,  but didn't really use it that well  .   They did send Chappie in a different direction than I anticipated  ,  but that didn't justify the lack of depth I expected from the same director as District 9  .   Overall  ,  this is an OK sci - fi movie  .   It is entertaining  ,  but it falls short in most aspects to be a \"good\" movie for me  .   Worth a watch if you like AI sci - fi  ,  or if you just want a decent MOVIE_SCENE movie  .  6 / 10 "}, {"review": " This is probably the worst  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  seen so far to date  .   The MOVIE_STORY line is linear and simplistic  ,  acting are all round passable ;  and the only enjoyable part I found is the CG  -  which is fantastic  .   MOVIE_DIRECTOR  has been on a downward slide ever since his groundbreaking \"District 9\"  ,  which combined the footage style with documentary style editing  ,  giving it a very personable  ,  realistic / surrealistic experience on current social commentary on illegal immigration and plights of refugees  .  This movie is devoid any of that  .   It has no depth  ,  AI and consciousness were not explored or explained  .   It just happened to push an infantile MOVIE_STORY line  .   Overall  ,  not a movie you want to spend time on  .   "}, {"review": " I have used IMDb for probably the last 5 years to check out reviews before I spend my time watching a movie  .   This was the movie that got me to sign up to write this review  .  I thought this movie was soooooooooo good !  I was scratching my head that some reviews were 1 - 5 starts  .   I read their lengthy reviews and even if all their \"cons\" to the movie were accurate it would still never get below a 7star rating  .  This movie was great  .   Critics always base their rating off tons of different things  .   Hey  .    .    .  Critics  .    .    .    .   wake the F @  #  %  up !  This movie wasn't super artsy or so different that it was a piece for critic fan boys to drool over  .   This movie was awesome  .  Sorry Critics  ,  did you want it to go by the same guidelines as iRobot  ,  or terminator  ,  or short circuit ?  Which by the way if you combine all of those movies you would get Chappie !  See it  ,  I guarantee it you wont regret it  ,  if you do  ,  you need medicine  .    .    .    .    .   probably the hard stuff  .   "}]
