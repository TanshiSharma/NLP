[{"review": " 'How to Train Your Dragon' is my all - time favourite animated film  ,  so when I heard a sequel was being made  ,  I knew it was one I had to see  .   The last animated film I saw in the cinema was 'Toy Story 3' four years ago  ,  so going to see this beautifully executed flick was a treat  .   This film truly lives up to its expectations and builds upon its predecessor's achievements like any good sequel should  ,  and from this  ,  the outcome is stunning  .   More mature and thematic than its predecessor  ,  'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is an emotionally resonant and heartfelt flick that expands upon the MOVIE_STORY of Hiccup and Toothless and their connection  .   With swooping and stunning  MOVIE_SCENE s and epic animated set pieces  ,  this is a sequel to remember  ,  a modern masterpiece  .   "}, {"review": "  ~ NO SPOILERS ~ How to Train your Dragon 2 is a shining example of what both family movies and animated films are capable of  .   This is not the same MOVIE_STORY rehashed over again  .   From the characters  ,  to the MOVIE_STORY  ,  to the MOVIE_SCENE  ,  to the comedy  ,  this film does what any sequel should do by stepping up its predecessor in every way possible  ,  and respects its audience enough not to shy away from its darker and more dramatic content  ,  but still remain viewable and entertaining for all audiences  .   We are talking about a PG rated Dreamworks film after all  .   From the moment the MOVIE_MUSIC began playing during the beginning to when the end credits began roiling  ,  I was completely immersed in this phenomenal movie that is more than worthy to stand along side the likes of any great live - MOVIE_SCENE fantasy film or the past decade  .   Possibly one the the best animated movies I have ever seen  ,  this is the Empire Strikes Back of animated films  .   9 / 10  ( Very possibly will increase to 10 / 10 upon my second viewing  .   )  "}, {"review": " This movie hits it out of the park regarding all the important factors   .   Storytelling  ,  voice cast and MOVIE_SCENE is top class  .   The kids will get entertained and the parents even more so  ,  because the movie is intelligent as well as fun  .   The dragon's depictions are very amazing  ,  you find yourself smitten by these creatures and also caring for the human characters  .  Is it better than the first film ?  Yes  ,  with improvements in the areas of emotion and magnitude  .   This one is also very different than the first one  .  So  ,  verdict  .  YOU BETTER GO SEE THIS AS SOON AS YOU CAN !  "}, {"review": " This movie touch me  .   The MOVIE_STORY line is amazing and at the same time lovely as u guys know already that basically that the MOVIE_STORY of How To Train Your Dragon 2 is about Hiccup reunited with his mother  ,  Valka  .   While Stoick The Vast will continue his love to Valka as he thought Valka was dead  .   The voice MOVIE_ACTOR for Valka  ,   MOVIE_CAST   .   Her voice is just perfect for Valka character  .   The MOVIE_STORY for this movie is really touching as the family go up against the enemy  , Drago BloodVist  .   The  MOVIE_SCENE s for this movie is incredibly stunning  .   For those people asking whether to watch in 3D  ,  My answer is yes it is definitely worth your money  .   I think this movie is suitable for people in the world as it is one of a kind movie  .   So just relax enjoy your sit and your popcorn and enjoy watching the movie  .   "}, {"review": " I liked the first movie enough to re - watch it  ,  but the sequel is too long  ,  too simplistic  ,  and is yet another Hollywood epic that preaches pacifism and negotiation only to create a final solution out of MOVIE_SCENE  .   The politically correct messages are overbearing  ,  the catering to every conceivable demo MOVIE_SCENE  obvious  ,  and the characterizations disturbingly one - note  .   The whiny mannerisms of the hero really began to bug me only a short way into the movie  .   And they kill off an important character who happened to be my favorite  .   Does anyone else find it odd that the other characters seem blissfully happy only a few minutes later ? How this movie has garnered a rating over 8 is beyond me  .   It's contrived and a real disappointment in my book  .   "}, {"review": " I LOVE the first movie  .   My favourite animated film  ,  outside of Disney  ,  of all time and I was worried that this might not hold up to the original  .  I was wrong  .  I'm still in two minds if it is better than the original though  .  One thing that astounds me is the detail  .   The effects are absolutely mind - blowing and very thorough  .   There are some MOVIE_SCENE s of Toothless where you can see the detail in his scales  ,  including sometimes dirt and scars  .  The original voice cast is back and still awesome  ,  the MOVIE_STORY is amazing  ,  the effects are jaw dropping and the score fits with the film perfectly  .  This movie has everything in just over 100 minutes ;  MOVIE_SCENE  ,  adventure  ,  laughs  ,  tears for every one of all ages  .  I just have one complaint\u0085\u0085 I DON'T WANNA WAIT JUST OVER THREE YEARS FOR THE NEXT FILM !  !  !

Since the movie started i knew i would love it ;  it's really one of the best animated movies i've ever seen  .  One of the most stunning things of the movie  ( and it's equal in the first one )  is the MOVIE_SCENE  .   All the characters  ,  dragons and lands are highly detailed  ,  the movements are perfect and all of it is brightly designed  .   Besides that  ,  the history of this one is very touching and you will feel it throughout the entire film  .  Concluding  ,  you will enjoy it if you are a child or you are 50  .   If you enjoyed the first part  ,  you can't miss this one !  "}, {"review": " I love this movie but each time I see HTYD2 it cuts me deep and I keep wondering what has happened to MOVIE_SCENE industry ?  These movies are supposed to be for kids !  Why more and more directors feel obliged to add cruel reality to cartoons ?  Having a family reuniting after 20 years to see them torn apart again by killing one of our favorite characters is really disturbing and it feels so unfair ! Cartoons are supposed to give us hope  .    .    .   Half of this movie was for us to feel happy for Hiccup and Stoick having found his mother and wife  .    .  They tested our empathy and compassion just to be devastated when Stoick dies just minutes after dancing with his long - lost love ! I mean come on you have to be heartless not to feel sick by that !  I mean did the directors hoped for a cinema full of children crying ?  Anyway  ,  prepare yourselves to share some tears  .    .

Everybody care about Hiccup and Astrid  ,  Yes I did care about them in the first movie but not this one  .  The \"Love Part\" in this movie belongs to Stoick and Valka  .   It was so beautiful how they pair up and dance I loved Hiccup's look  , It's full of happiness to see his parents together  .   They just found each other after 20 years they both deserve more than that one hour  .   As Stoick died I just couldn't enjoy the movie anymore  ,  I just watched  .   It was not fair to Valka Stoick and Hiccup  .   Damn You  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  damn you  .   I HOPE you pay for this  .

This movie was breathtaking  ,  heart - wrenching  ,  astounding  ,  beautiful  ,  and funny !  Without doubt the best movie I have ever seen  .   I convinced my mother to come see it with me  ,  she was skeptical but humored me and she was just as blown away as I was  .   We had to go back to the theater to see it again  .   One of my favorite things about the first one was the MOVIE_MUSIC and I was thrilled that John Powell managed to top the original score  .   Like the movie itself  ,  the MOVIE_MUSIC is more mature and absolutely sweeps you away  .   I listen to the  MOVIE_MUSIC track every day and I still marvel at its power and the emotion it evokes  .   Don't be put off because it's ( beautifully ) animated  ,  you won't find a better movie !  Now we just have to endure the long wait till the final movie  .   How can they top this ?  I don't know  ,  but I have faith that they will !  "}, {"review": " I can sympathize with all the great reviews  ,  I love the dragons  ,  I love Hiccup and I share his love for the bad - ass Astrid  .   And there is plenty of great breathtaking scenes in this new movie  .  Yet the scenario is really lacking in almost every dimension  .   It is completely unclear why the villain  ( who  ,  by the way  ,  lacks any depth beyond I'm - angry - because - the - dragons - burned - my - village )  is able to control such a huge dragon as the alpha  .   The introduction of the alpha as a race  ,  after seeing the dragon villain in the first movie  ,  is also very debatable  .   The telepathic control that the human villain gains almost for himself is such a stretch that it's bordering inconsistency  .   The list could go on and on and on  .

I had high expectations from this movie  ,  based on the previews - and my love for the first one  .   And I was not let down  .   I've lost count on how many times I've watched the first movie  .   This movie was way more emotional than that one  .   They went places that are pretty dark to go to for a cartoon  .   And it made me cry more than any other film this year  .   Even more than The Fault In Our Stars  .   And can I just mention the character development ?  Hiccup's journey from the young  ,  rather careless boy in the first movie to a young man - a young leader -  in the second one is INCREDIBLE to watch  .   And the father has a lot of development  ,  also  .   And so does Astrid  ,  but it's mostly Hiccup  .   And even Toothless gets his moment to shine  ,  in one of the coolest scenes in the movie  .   I don't want to give anything away  ,  so I won't say much more about it  .  Just  ,  be prepared to bring tissues  .   And be prepared to be amazed  .   Really amazed  .

She starts off as this uber dragon queen person and then as the MOVIE_STORY goes dissolves into a bit of a nobody  -  except Hiccups mum  .   What happened to the use of her weird dragon blade weapon ?  Why was her Alpha so lame ? Hiccup ends up as chief even though clearly he has no interest in that kind of thing ? Why did the Alpha follow this nasty guy Drago ? The whole intelligence level of this movie just seemed quite a few notches down on the first one  .

It did take me a while to get past  MOVIE_CAST  \"I always look like I have a migraine\"  MOVIE_CAST 's voice for the main character  .   It's one of my problems with having celebrities do voices for animated characters  .   Many times it is hard to separate the human providing the voice from the character on the screen  .   Producers could save a bundle by just hiring decent voice MOVIE_ACTOR  -  -  kids wouldn't care who is providing the voice  ,  and I can't imagine that adults are going to an animated movie because a celebrity is doing the voice  .  I have to wonder if they used Tommy Wiseau  ( The Room )  as an inspiration for the design of the bad guy  .   And the dragon still looks like Stitch  .

I think the reason that there's a 5 year gap is to make room for the television show that's currently in production  .   I guess it will fill the gaps in between  ,  which is fair enough  .  Probably the most surprising thing about this movie is the director  .   The original film was written and directed by 3 people  ( the guys who made Lilo and Stitch  ,  another great film )   ,  but only one of them stayed behind to direct the sequel  .   I'll assume without evidence the other two moved either to the TV series or to some other project  .   But since it's more of a solo project than a threesome project  ,  it's a lot less clich\u00e9d and a lot more focused on a single MOVIE_STORY  .

Sad that all the Lego fans are being rude abut this movie !  But this movie will make you very emotional  .   I watched it 3 times and it made me cry every time  .   and for the characters  ,  they actually make them develop  ,  unlike a lot of movies  .   The MOVIE_SCENE is gorgeous  ,  and I will say its the best MOVIE_SCENE I've ever seen  .   They made everything so detailed  .   You can see the scars and freckles on everyone's faces  .   And they didn't make the characters perfect looking  .  They made them have flaws  .   Like valka with her wrinkles and her grey hair  ,  same with stoick  .   The villain was a little clich\u00e9  ,  but it makes up for it at the end !  MOVIE_SCENE are AMAZING  .  If you haven't seen this movie yet  .   GO SEE IT  .

There's nothing could be more nervous when facing a reunion after 20 years  .   Especially Valka  ,  she abandoned her family to protect dragons  .   We can see her fear by her endless explanation when she saw Stock  .   She expected Stoick's anger maybe that's what she felt guilty for 20 years  .   However what Stoick said was not blame  ,  the words are \"You are as beautiful as the day I lost you\" which contained all the missing  .   For him  ,  she must be the most beautiful woman in the world  ,  in his heart  .  We can always blame someones  ,  but we can also be generous to them  .  After so many years  ,  what i remembered is just how kind  ,  beautiful you are  ,  I will never blame you because I love you  .   "}, {"review": " Liked this animated feature film very much  .   It had all features of a normal or non - animated movie  .   It had MOVIE_SCENE  ,  MOVIE_STORY  ,  emotion and best of all had a very good MOVIE_STORY  .   The deaths in MOVIE_SCENE are rarity and given not much importance and usually of a villainous character  .   But in this movie not one but two deaths have given importance and has very good impact on the MOVIE_STORY of the MOVIE_STORY  .  Initially I had disregard about watching the movie as I was of opinion that the prequel was perfectly done and MOVIE_STORY had perfectly ended in it and this sequel was just commercials  .

I can't really say what I didn't like  ,  there was just something missing  .   It didn't pull me in  ,  and I was almost kind of bored at times  .

I loved the use of a coming of age MOVIE_STORY and liked how Hiccup came to except his role as the new Chief of Berk  .   I also liked the way Hiccup and Astrid's relationship was portrayed in this movie  .   Hiccup and Astrid having been in a relationship for a long time at the time the second movie took place really acted a way couple should act around each other  .   My favorite moment between Hiccup and Astrid is when Hiccup pulls Astrid in for a kiss near the end of the movie  .   What was also great to see was how Hiccup helped Astrid win the game at the end when he grabbed the black sheep and threw it into Astrid's basket  .   One other great thing about the movie was the MOVIE_MUSIC and how it was as good as the first and again specific themes were used to represent certain things  .   I loved how John Powell worked in MOVIE_MUSIC from the first one into the second one  .   Overall a great movie and worth watching again and again  .  My grade for the movie is an A +   .

I was completely taken by this animated movie   ,  for so long i waited for a good animated movie to come and after watching this i really can say that the MOVIE_STORY was too good  .

No doubt the cinematography and  MOVIE_SCENE s effect was up - to the modern era's perfection but MOVIE_STORY was bit weak and was not as powerful and catchy as it was supposed to be  .   The dragon \"Toothless\" along with his rider \"Hiccup\" are again main leads of the movie which pretty much is same thing for viewers and the ancient charm and terror of dragons are seemed to be carried away from the movies which i think is giving a new perception towards the dragons  .   this may effect the original and ancient terrorizing and horrific image of dragons and a new conceptual idea of dragon being a pet makes place in the viewers mind  .   The twists and turns of the movie are pretty expected and the end of the movie can be guessed at the mid of it  .   with its perfect MOVIE_SCENE and beautiful cinematography and catchy creatures in it and bearable language  ,  this movie is watchable for children of all age groups  .

Sadly that still hasn't happened  ,  but at least they have the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series  .  The sequel isn't quite as funny as the original -  - and intentionally so I believe -  - and its lacks the thrill of discovery that naturally comes with a coming - of - age MOVIE_STORY like 'HTTYD'  ,  but what it lacks in laughs it makes up for with thrilling MOVIE_SCENE MOVIE_SCENE and some genuine pathos  .

By the end I was clapping and even though I was the only one it was worth being the only one  .   It is very different from the original  ,  much more mature  ,  which I was not expecting  ,  but I am so happy I went to see it and I can't wait to see the third and final installment  ,  the biggest surprise was the death of huge character in the series  .   As I was watching the movie it felt like it was so much longer than and hour and thirty minutes  ,  but in a good way it made me lose track of time and was just beautiful  ,  the MOVIE_SCENE was flawless and the MOVIE_STORY amazing  ,  I would recommend this movie to literally anyone  ,  just note is is darker and more mature  .    .    .   "}, {"review": " I don't really like watching sequels as they are most often disappointments  .   However  ,  this is definitely not one of those  .  It is a compelling adventure and a rocky emotional roller coaster telling the MOVIE_STORY of true friendship  .   I have enjoyed it to the last minute and while the inner child in me might have hoped for a slightly different MOVIE_STORY  ,  the harsh truth remains harsh as ever :  there's always a winning and a losing side  .   Overall  ,  however  ,  the movie is outrageously funny and uplifting  ,  yet  ,  a bit heart wrenching in all the right places  .   Definitely one of the motion pictures I'll be showing to my kids in the future  .   "}]
