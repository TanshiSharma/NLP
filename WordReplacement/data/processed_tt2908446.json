[{"review": " On what grounds does this movie have 6  , 9 rating on IMDb ?  This insults the intelligence  .    MOVIE_CAST  has no character and acts like she is first time in front of the  MOVIE_SCENE   .   MOVIE_SCENE is meaningless  .   This is what happens when you run out of ideas  .   45 minutes before the end I wanted to quit  ,  but  .    .    .  I did not do it  .   Why ?  Because I had hoped it will improve  ,  and then  .    .    .   nothing  .   This is the most honest opinion about this movie that I was able to give you  .   Now  ,  I'm asking you  ,  do you have 119 minutes of your life to waste ?  Oh what  ,  you do not believe me ?  No problem !  Just remember what I told you and come back after you watch this piece of abomination  .   As regards of  MOVIE_CAST   ,  first I have to say that I'm fan of her earlier works  ,  but this is something else  .   This she did not need  .   A huge step backwards in her career  .

Maybe if I was a third grader I would appreciate this fantasy but as an adult it was torture to watch  .  This movie would need some serious surgery to actually pass as something I could make all the way through  .   I didn't make it all the way through by the way  .   The casting  ,  direction and MOVIE_STORY would all have to be redone  .   Basically  ,  throw it all out and start over  .   Otherwise  ,  this could possibly work as a Yahoo TV movie  .  File this one in the folder of movies that think the audience is dumb and will just be wow'd by ridiculous MOVIE_SCENE and young heroes  .   So annoying and such a waste of my time  .

The good old days where if you went to see a movie set in a dystopian future where a corrupt government put its citizenry in peril on a whim  ,  it was rated R because it contained great special effects  ,  gritty foul language laced MOVIE_STORY ue  ,  and contained adult themes  .   But this !  Okay !  I understand the concept of movie studios dumbing this type of film down so tweens can partake in something that makes them feel like they are cool  ,  or makes them feel like their rebelling  .  Even though they aren't really  ,  they're just soaking up things that have been rehashed from what was cool 25 +  years ago  .   Please !

Jeanine's political words are just admiring  ,  she knows the dangers of the threats but then again  ,  she'a a villain so I have to hate her  .   The  MOVIE_SCENE  effects are just the best here  ,  especially during the simulation where the building is ripped etc  .

Watching  MOVIE_CAST  run in this film is silly  -  -  she has no athletic presence to sell this role  ,  and without that  ,  the whole premise collapses on itself  .

It also tries to distance itself from the Hunger Games series  ( which never hid or mentioned what it was copying itself  ,  Battle Royale being one of the sources )   .   Does it succeed ?  That's up to you to decide  .   Every teenage movie  ( YA as the movies and books are called )  going for that theme  ,  will have that comparison  .   I'm not sure if the next one will be the last  ,  but even if it so  ,  the next YA movie series will be coming soon   .    .    .   they are just too successful   .    .    .

MOVIE_CAST  did an amazing job as Tris and she delivers a trustworthy performance and she starts growing on me more and more  .    MOVIE_CAST  also made a great performance as Four /  Tobias and you just can't help but fall in love with his character  .

Unsurprisingly I was thrilled to watch the movie  -  and guess what ?   -  I liked it ! First  ,  Insurgent starts pretty much at the beginning of the movie with Tris and Four running to Amity  -  the kind faction to find a place to hide  .   But they find out the struggles of being in a faction that does not belong to them  .   Meanwhile  ,  Jeanine is searching in all the factions the one special divergent that will be able to open the mystery box that Tris's parents were hiding from the society  .   As a result  ,  Tris and Four find them selves on the one hand running from Jeannine and on the other hand preparing for war against Jeanine  .  Insurgent is packed with MOVIE_SCENE  , strong emotional and MOVIE_STORY scenes and also lots of well done performances from all the MOVIE_ACTOR  (  especially  MOVIE_CAST 's )   .  In my opinion you should ignore all the reviews and go watch a very good movie that contains lots of MOVIE_STORY  , MOVIE_SCENE  , well done performances and MOVIE_STORY  .

Add to that  ,  without hesitation  ,  also a fully adult  ,  mature audience  .   Recommended  .   "}, {"review": " I would of given this movie 9  .  8 but that is not an option  .   Moving on  ,  this movie was very enjoyable  .   At the start of the movie  ,  I was skeptical but as I progressed through the movie  ,  I learned to love it  .   This was a great book to movie adaptation  .   Some people said it was untrue to the book and  ,  I admit they did add a couple things  .   But  ,  they still stayed true to the MOVIE_STORY  .   I usually don't say this very often but I enjoyed this movie more than the book  .   I was excellent  .   In some parts  ,  characters were bland  ,  but most of the time  ,  they did good  .   Overall  ,  this movie was great and I would definitely recommend watching this to all Divergent fans  .   "}, {"review": " Firs of all I wanna say that its been a while without being disturbed in a cinema watching a film  .   It was so amazing looking all that people staying so focused on the film for 2 hours  .   Just this fact means a lot in my opinion  .   After I saw the Film I am convinced that Insurgent was a better than Divergent for 2 reasons  .   1  .   More MOVIE_SCENE 2  .   More Special Effects  .   Overall this Film like my summary tittle says is an all in one film :  1  .   Intrigant MOVIE_STORY  ( even for the people like my friend that Doesn't have seen the first film )  2  .   An amazing cast and specially  MOVIE_CAST   ,  Its incredible the part when she has to fights against herself  .   Great performance really  .   3  .   Stunning special effects 4  .   Fantastic  MOVIE_MUSIC track all over the film  .   After U saw this film in the cinema without special emotions well U are an old grandma or grandpa  :  )  jokingJust go and enjoy this film is great  .   "}, {"review": " Insurgent disappointed me  .   The acting was poor  ,  the invasion MOVIE_SCENE was pathetic  ,  some of the MOVIE_STORY was empty and laughable  ,  and some things she did didn't make sense  .   There was a lot wrong with the movie  ,  and the rebel group wasn't even worked up at all  .  Furthermore  ,  the headquarters for said rebel group have a MOVIE_SCENE that is the same exact MOVIE_SCENE that they used to do the Mockingjay \"messages\" scenes  ,  with the rose petals on the broken concrete  .   Minus the rose petals in this movie  ,  it was the exact same MOVIE_SCENE  .  3 of the tests were stupid too  ,  where she had to just be normal  ,  and she didn't even have to try for those tests  .   And when she was fighting herself  ,  her not - that - really - terrible self  ,  there came a point where she sacrificed herself to her copy and her copy just dispersed  ,  rather than \"killing\" her and waking her up  .  It would have been an OK movie had it not been a sequel  ,  but being that it was a sequel  ,  they just failed  .   I'm kinda sad  ,  I was expecting so much more  .   "}, {"review": " I do not understand the critics at all !  !  !  What movie are you guys watching ?  This movie is fantastic just like the first one  .   And if you are going to throw the comparison of Hunger Games  ,  well the last Hunger Games was HORRIBLE !  !  I like hunger games but lets be honest  ,  the last one was so not that great  .  I love  MOVIE_CAST  and shailene woodley chemistry so much and their acting its spot on  ,  this is was a fantastic film  .    .    .   haven't read the books  ,  so cannot say what it supposed to be like  .  Don't listen to the critics  ,  but lets face it if our job was to \"critic\" movies  ,  then we would be always looking at ways of how to criticize something HEAVILY just because we can  .  Don't over analyse it  .    .    .   this is a MOVIE_SCENE packed film  ,  so it accomplishes THAT exactly  .   "}]
