[{"review": " I went into this movie not having read the book and not knowing anything more than the overall MOVIE_STORY  .   I am a sucker for a good love MOVIE_STORY  ,  especially love that I can relate to  .   The pain and emotions felt by the characters felt so real  ,  as if I was feeling the same emotions  .  Though this was THE SADDEST movie I have ever seen  ,  it was also one of the most beautiful  ,  as it truly showed how exhilarating and comforting and exciting love is  .   I probably cried throughout about half of the movie  ,  along with the rest of the audience  .   I cried to the point of heaving out loud and needing more than the 2 tissues I came in with  .   Again  ,  the MOVIE_ACTOR really expressed the emotions of the characters well and I felt that  .   I am going to see it again for sure  .  GO SEE IT IF YOU LOVE EMOTIONAL MOVIES !

Being an avid book reader  ,  I'm always skeptical about watching the words of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big screen  .    .    .   but TFIOS stayed true to the book  .   The movie was absolutely lovely from beginning to end  .   The young MOVIE_ACTOR were great  .   The comedy hit on all the right notes  ,  the MOVIE_STORY made your heart smile and the tragedy pulled at your heart strings  .   It really was a wonderful adaptation  ,  and I believe it stayed as true to the book as possible without many changes where there were any  .   The minute it was over  ,  I wanted to watch it again  .   Upon leaving the theater  ,  I looked around and there was not one dry eye  .   Not even the men  .   If you are a big fan of the book  ,  like myself  .    .    .   and are skeptical about whether this stays true  .   Don't be  .   Kudos the John Green on his first film adaptation  .

I brought a box of tissues and I used about half of them  .   I have never cried so much in my entire life  .   Being an avid fan of the book  ,  I was kind of scared that like some of my other favourite books  ,  the movie would be ruined  .   But no  ,  the movie had all of the book's materials in it  ( except for one thing )   .   I never thought  MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST  would play Hazel and Gus  ,  but when I watched it  ,  their performance blew me away  .   I think  MOVIE_CAST 's ability to cry got ME crying  ,  because that's how real it felt  .   It is an amazing movie  ,  and I'm sorry to say that it's even better than A Walk to Remember  .

She is outstanding in every MOVIE_SCENE she is and I have to say I am kind of in love with Hazel  .   Even though its a love MOVIE_STORY of a girl who has terminal cancer I wouldn't say that the film is tragic rather the film is about living your life to the fullest in your 'little infinity' If you have already read the book  ,  the film is true to the book and the great acting  ,  directing and MOVIE_MUSIC adds another dimension to the MOVIE_STORY  .   The Fault In Our Stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies ever  .

The Fault In Our Stars is a fantastic book which has a really sad MOVIE_STORY  ( I'm not going to say it to you )   .   As the quote says \"Some Infinities are bigger than others\" however  ,  Hazel and Gus's love was quite an extraordinary one  .   It must of been hard living with Cancer  .   The book was different  ,  but it still had the same MOVIE_STORY to the film but with more parts  .   I got the book after the film came out so my book has the photos in it  .   I have to say I did cry at the end but I couldn't stop blabbering through the film  .   Too be honest  ,  Hazel Grace has inspired me  .   Not everything in life is perfect and people are dying  ,  this book showed the good and bad sides to cancer  .   Like the book says  ,  pain demands to be felt  .   It touched my sad side  .

The male lead could not act and therefore I was not convinced and therefore I did not cry  .   I cry at everything usually but this film is not convincing at all  .   It was definitely the male lead that spoilt it for me  .   I just didn't understand his naked obsession with the female lead  .   From the minute he sets eyes on her  ,  wham he is in love !  I found that very strange  ,  or maybe it was just the way he did it  .   I know love at first sight happens but this seemed way over the top  .   If you watch Love Story from the 60's which features cancer  ,  it has an authentic love MOVIE_STORY and build up but this film does not seem to be that genuine so you don't really care about the characters  .

But the \"tragedy\" here is that pretentious d - bag Gus  ( and his cringe worthy pseudo intellectual metaphor )  died  * after *  traveling to Europe and banging a hot girl  .   Oh the humanity !  This is a love MOVIE_STORY written for the 1 %   ,  where the biggest tragedy in life is that spoiled little daddy's money babies Gus and Hazel couldn't live to 90 off their parent's dime  ,  probably in some Malibu beach house  .

It was funny and certainly heart gripping  .   I thought  MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST  did a great job  .

The editing was awkward at times and there were noticeable contradictory mistakes that I will not dwell on other than to say  ( without spoiling anything )  that there is a teleporting basketball trophy  .    .    .   See if you can spot it !  !  I also felt that the framing was too narrow at times and some of the two frame MOVIE_SCENE s were unnecessary and distracting  .   My last and largest problem was that there is a huge difference in what works in a book and what works on film  .   Some scenes can feel odd \u0096 and that is because they are out of place  .   In addition  ,  the themes could have been much stronger and left us in really thinking  .   Sadly the film did not quite make it  .  I may be focusing too much on the negatives  .

It's refreshing to see a female teen character who attracts a guy through her smarts and wits  .   It's also refreshing seeing a male character who isn't all horned up and actually believes in courtship and respect  .   A special shout out to  MOVIE_CAST  _  MOVIE_CAST   ,  who has an amazing and convincing performance  .   If you are parent of teenagers  ,  I this would be a mostly positive movie for kids to watch  .   There is just old - fashion courting that you never see in teen sex comedies  .

Heck  ,  even the characters from the blandest dime - a - dozen big - budget MOVIE_SCENE film you can think of have more dimension and personality than the ones paraded across the screen here  .   Make no mistake :  This movie's screenwriters didn't set out to write a MOVIE_STORY about Hazel and Gus  .   No  ,  they set out to write an Emotional movie with a capital \"E  .  \" I have nothing against those movies ;  as a matter of fact  ,  I absolutely eat them up  .   But the thing is  ,  in order to be effective  ,  you need characters that people care about and identify with  ,  not cardboard cutouts with about as much depth as a single sheet of paper  .   "}, {"review": " So  .    .   I loved this  .   Just so dreamy and full of insight on life and death  .   Is what I would say if I was a 14 year old girl with a crush  .   spoiler alert  .   CHICK FLICK  .    .    .   of the worst sort  .   Girls and women  ,  You watch this movie and love it  .   You will love it  .   Guys you will watch it because they want to watch it  .   Your flesh will crawl  ,  and the logic parts of your brain will liquify with emotion  .   I am going to have to go watch All of Archer to reset my brain now  .   But that's just me  .   On the plus side  .   Its very well acted  ,  good character development  ,  Some real touching and funny moments  .   The MOVIE_STORY is a bit blah  ,  but no ware near most of the Hollywood tripe so it can be enjoyed  .   The cigarette thing is irritating as hell  ,  metaphor or no  .   "}]
