The MOVIE_STORY was predictable at some points and the acting was so poor amongst some of the MOVIE_ACTOR  .

Bane  ,  the main villain of this movie was killed in a split second and everything was forgotten about him  ,  that's it  .   It's like the MOVIE_STORY writers wanted this movie to end quickly as possible at this point  .   The MOVIE_ACTOR playing Miranda who appears to be Ra's Al Ghul's daughter Talia should get the award for worst death presentation  ,  it was some of the worst acting I have ever seen  ,  you can tell that she is acting  .   It's like she is taking a nap for crying out loud  .   Blake who appears to be Robin gets access to the Batman cave and all the high tech stuff that is in there  ,  but he didn't receive any training at all so he wouldn't know how to use it  .   Robin is just an ordinary cop in this movie with no combat skills  ,  yet Bruce Wayne gives away the cave to him and settles down with the supposed Catwoman  .   "}, {"review": " 1  .

To me the only saving grace was killing Batman because they killed his career with this insipid movie but alas they even screwed that up  .

Batman will be forced to come out of hiding and will need the help of a cat burglar but things become more complicated when there is another plotter behind the evil plan  .   The pacing is slightly off for the first 45 minutes and a couple of MOVIE_STORY holes crept in but it did not effect the MOVIE_STORY overall  .    MOVIE_CAST  steals the show and the fact that you can barely see his face did not knock the effectiveness of his chilling presence when ever in a MOVIE_SCENE which just boasts his ability as a MOVIE_ACTOR  .   It would be a crime to forget  MOVIE_CAST  who provided the key role as Selina Kyle  .  With some great  MOVIE_SCENE  work and fairly decent fight routines between  MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST  the final installment is a overwhelming success  .

It made the last Batman series of its time a golden trilogy  .   It had a tough task of following up the epic movie \"The Dark Knight\" and it followed it well  .   It wasn't better than \"The Dark Knight\"  ( I didn't expect it to be )  but it was definitely a great film in its own right  .   MOVIE_CAST  did a great job playing Catwoman  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  put her in a position to play Catwoman gracefully  .   Get job on  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  and  MOVIE_CAST 's part  .   Bane was awesome !  I had a little problem understanding what he was saying at times  ,  but overall I loved his character in the film  .  I'm giving this movie a 9 out of 10  .   This is a great film  ,  with a great MOVIE_STORY  ,  and solid execution  .   If you are a Batman fan of any kind you will appreciate this film more than anyone  .

Contrary to a really emotional connection of the characters to the audience there are still the super powers and the silly latex costume  .

It tears apart Batman lore  ,  It makes Bane into a lovesick puppy dog that couldn't escape the friend zone and Talia just turns into a cow without any of the honor her father or her clan had in the previous movies  .

He realized that after 8 years of no life at all  ,  he couldn't just don the mask and the cape and become Batman  .   He again faces fear  ,  learns to overcome it and gets his training in a way  .

"}, {"review": " What a mess  .   This is one of  MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's weakest movies and definitely the worst in the Batman trilogy  .  I didn't expect much from the trailer  ,  but it was even worse than I thought  .   It's not terrible  ,  but it's not a good film either  .  The characters were uninteresting  ,  MOVIE_STORY was a mess  ,  lots of useless fighting scenes  .    MOVIE_CAST 's talent was wasted and Bane character isn't even 1 %  as strong or as interesting as the Joker  .   Most of all I liked Michael Caine's performance  ,  but that was brief and the editor rushed his few scenes too  .  Oh  ,  and the movie is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long  .   Did they really need 3 hours to tell this mess ?  ?  ?  "}, {"review": " I Lithuanian  ,  I grow up watching Lithuanian Batman with gnashing teeth  ,  scythe  & amp ;  big wing  .
