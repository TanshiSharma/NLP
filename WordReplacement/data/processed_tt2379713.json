The pace of this film after a predictably exciting start is slow and boring  .   Unlike his fellow MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  Ben Whishaw as Q manages to portray the only believable human in this whole fake production  .   Why couldn't JB have been given a touch of Q's wit  ,  humour or vulnerability ?  No wonder  MOVIE_CAST  wants out of this franchise  -  it's beneath his talent  .   Such a cacophony of totally forgettable MOVIE_STORY ue  ,  people and silly stunts is hard to imagine in a single movie and yet here it is  .   During one of the 'action' fights when James was being hammered by the evil assassin I noticed the person next to me had fallen asleep and was snoring  .

The movie is plain boring  ,  not just because of the lacklustre MOVIE_SCENE  ,  but also because of the dreadful  , uninteresting pedestrian MOVIE_STORY  ,  the slowdown pacing and some very bland performances  .  The title song  -  which amazingly won an Oscar  -  is diabolical  .   If this is the best that the film makers can churn out then the best thing would be for them to stop making them  .

The movie featured a little more MOVIE_STORY than the usual  .   The cinematography and the MOVIE_MUSIC score for this film really made the scenes grip the viewer  .   It was an interesting take to have Bond's adopted brother be the villain  .   It made the MOVIE_STORY a lot darker and the fact that he described himself as the \"author of all your pain\"  ,  implied that this man was a way bigger threat  ,  because he most likely had been sabotaging things for years  .   The last MOVIE_SCENE with the booby traps and the girl in danger was a little clich\u00e9  ,  but it was nice to see how much thought went into it  .   Whether it was CGI or makeup  ,  the antagonist looked spooky with the missing eye  .   With the combination of all the  MOVIE_SCENE  surveillance and the immense knowledge the enemy group had on James Bond  ,  this is one of the few films that really makes the audience fear for him  .   It's a nonstop ride from start to finish with a little humor  ,  and just enough back MOVIE_STORY to make the people care  .   WELL DONE  .   "}, {"review": " WOW !

Bond  ,  who only has his wit and some gizmo's to bring them down  .   About the Movie / Verdict :  \"Spectre\" isn't a bad film  .   It just isn't really a great one  .   Movie is worth seeing as a big budget Bond epic that ticks all the right boxes without hitting all the right notes  .   It reportedly cost  $ 300 - 350 million and it's apparent in every frame packed with extras  ,  expensive equipment  ,  and grand locations from Mexico to Britain to Italy to Austria to Morocco and to the African desert  .   If \"Skyfall\" was the pinnacle of  MOVIE_CAST 's run as Bond  ,  \"Spectre\" signals a slight downturn and a need for the series to break new ground and redefine who James Bond is for the next generation  .

It's the first one that pits Bond against a villain of his own stature and a henchman of superior strength  ,  the first one that makes him look vulnerable or like he's in any danger  .   It's also more jam - packed with MOVIE_SCENE and less heavy on the psychodrama than the overrated \"Skyfall\" ;  psychoanalysis is still there  ,  but done in a more discreet way  ( like in the MOVIE_SCENE where Bond is \"interrogating\" a mouse )   .   There are flaws :  an atrocious title song  ,  an underdeveloped love MOVIE_STORY  ,  some illogical moments  .

Movie doesn't feel at all like the other titles of the saga  ,  It feels boring  ,  cheap and it has a tendency to be cartoonish like the classics  ,  which is why I don't like them  .  Maybe some fans of the old style would feel it like an improvement  ,  but for people like me is backwards  .  I would keep thinking about this saga as a trilogy  ,  and left this fourth chapter out of continuity  .

The villain  ,  didn't feel evil  ,  the huge henchman was just annoying  ,  and bond should have double tapped him in the head when he was lying unconscious on his car after the crash  .   But  ,  no let him live to come back again  .   The opening MOVIE_SCENE was good  ,  but the CGI explosion ruined that as well  .   Once again Bond is going rogue  ,  Mission Impossible anyone ?  Once again  ,  all our lives are being monitored and watched  .   Information is power  ( huge yawn )   .   I didn't watch this movie in one sitting  ,  I needed a 2 day break to get through it  ,  and even 20 minutes before the end  ,  got up had a cup of tea and a cigarette  .

There was not one redeeming MOVIE_SCENE in the entire movie  .   I've loved Bond moves since I was old enough to see them so this makes me very said  .   "}, {"review": " No way  .   As much as I adored the previous one  ,  this one was a complete and utter failure  .   Too complicated  ,  with little if any assistance for the viewer to catch up with the previous  .   Too many effects with no substance  .   Poorly written and poorly executed  .   You would think that the James Bond recipe is simple and straightforward but as it seems  ,  it's not  .   James Bond should be a fairly athletic lad  ,  with some spy skills that kind of gets out of these situations using his mind  .   A pumped up  ,  bodybuilder  ,  ugly  ,  not that clever altogether  ,  that mainly uses the gismos of Q to do what is necessary  ,  is a bad start  .    MOVIE_CAST  is not James Bond material and this became more apparent in this movie where he didn't have the supporting cast needed or the MOVIE_STORY that would save the day  .    .    .   I did not appreciate the movie altogether and I really hope that this was his last movie so that the francise can pick up on its former glory and give us a good movie or two  .    .    .   "}, {"review": " I'm a big fan of the bond series  ,  especially the ones with  MOVIE_CAST    ,  but this movie didn't meet my expectations at all  ,  and it didn't continue the momentum it built in the last three movies  .   I know this one is supposed to resurface the classic theme of Bond movies  ,  but i sincerely think that  MOVIE_CAST  shouldn't have done this one  ,  he should have called it a day after Sky - fall  ,  while he was on top of his game  ,  and then it would have been more appropriate that a new MOVIE_ACTOR adopts the classic bond style movies one more time  .   I only rated the movie with 5 out of 10 because of the disappointment  ,  and also because of some clich\u00e9s  ,  and some ridiculously loose scenes in the movie  .   "}, {"review": " I grew up watching Bond movies some were really fun and some were mediocre but non of them made me fall asleep  .   This manage to make me to fall asleep and that has happened only two times in my life from a film  .   This tries to make a complex MOVIE_STORY but at the end it gets lost in it's own MOVIE_STORY it is trying to make  .   They to focus on the essentials that made Bond movies fun MOVIE_SCENE  , simple MOVIE_STORY and great villains  .   This lacked all three  .   MOVIE_CAST  didn't convince me at all  MOVIE_CAST  looked like he was bored they only person that shined was Ben Whishaw by giving the comic relief that was needed  .   The starting sequence with helicopter cgi felt completely unreal which was the best part of the movie  .   I hope in the next Bond movie they will see there mistakes and fix them so they can save this franchise  .   "}, {"review": " What a mess !  It's like driving a great car with a flat tire  ,  no speed no nothing  .   I always thought  MOVIE_CAST  was a bad choice playing Bond  ,  he doesn't got the profile at all and this time I'm more than convinced  .   He can play any villain  ,  but not Bond  .   This is probably the worst Bond of all time  .   No suspense  ,  just driving a bit around  ,  letting exploding here and there a building and of course  ,  as a must as Bond  ,  sleeping with all the female characters  ,  what a performance  .   Fortunately the rest of the crew was more or less OK  .   We all learned a few letters of the alpabet such as M  ,  C  ,  and Q  .   Two and a half hour of pure senseless pursuit of I don't know what  .   Go fishing instead  ,  there is more suspense and fun in it  .   "}, {"review": " An embarrassing addition to the franchise and a terrible follow - up to the very enjoyable 'Skyfall'  .  Whoever signed - off on this MOVIE_STORY needs to be sat in front of the film  -  'Clockwork Orange' style  -  and made to watch it over and over and over and over  ( x1000 )   .  The avalanche of contrivances and tropes are only surpassed by the poor casting and truly horrific acting  -  including  ,  sadly  ,  an embarrassed looking  MOVIE_CAST   .  I was looking forward to this  -  much like the way I looked forward to 'Quantum of Something  ( or Other ) ' after 'Casino Royale'  -  and my disappointment then is perhaps topped by my disappointment now  .  If this pattern persists  ,  the next Bond film will again be very good  -  and again I will skip it in the cinemas after paying for this atrocity  .  3 / 10 "}, {"review": " i didn't expect to enjoy this half as much as i actually did  ,  its just the pinnacle of a classic bond film in my opinion and from the MOVIE_ACTOR to the MOVIE_STORY was executed flawlessly for what it was  ,  im not even such a big bond fan which is why i thought it may be a bit dry for me but having only seen a few of the bond movies which i vaguely remember  ,  this was still pretty epic  .    MOVIE_CAST  craig executed his part of the play with competence  ( as you'd expect )  and they didn't hesitate to start with a band and end with a bang  ,  thought not overdone  ,  the MOVIE_SCENE packed scenes are done tastefully for maximum effect and the film has a nice pace to it which makes the 2 and a half hours or so fly and keeps you engaged throughout  .   if your hesitating watching it like i was  ,  drop yourself and just go for it  .   "}, {"review": " The strong muscular performance we have come to expect of the new Bond's Aston Martin was one of the  ( few )  highlights of this much anticipated and widely fawned over film  .   Others have written longer and accurately but in summary :  Shockingly poor MOVIE_STORY Hackneyed  ,  clunky and at times utterly ridiculous  ( even for a Bond )  MOVIE_STORY line ;  Back to stupid gimmicks and gadgets a la Brosnan ;  Even for a Bond film the crash and fight scenes snapped the elastic band suspending my disbelief ;  Appalling wimpy Bond Song which was an unmemorable mess but ultimately portentous of how messy the film would prove to be ;  The acting was fine by and large but irrelevant in the pee soup of the MOVIE_STORY / MOVIE_STORY ;  Blofeld was the exception ;  totally cardboard rubbish  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  should hang his head in shame for returning Bond to the mire from which Bond emerged so fabulously in Casino Royale  .   If this was the last Bond  ,  Bond has gone out with a wimp ( er )  and if this is the future of Bond  ,  please don't do any more and let us remember DC in Casino Royale as  ( probably )  the best Bond ever  .

Bond Audience is not the same like in early 60's  .   a single hero MOVIE_STORY need to change  ; may be he need to team with Ethan and Mission Impossible team  .   Its a time Bond Should Die  .

As a Bond movie  ,  it delivers on the set piece front  ,  no question  .   That cold open is something else entirely  ,  and I absolutely loved the scenes in the Alps  .   There's even a slinky car chase and a brawl on a speeding train for heaven's sake  .   And it's nice looking  ,  too ;  lavishly appointed  ,  and that doesn't even cover the hotness of  MOVIE_CAST   .   Basically all the reasons to see it on the big screen  .  But the stakes are never really high  .   Bond goes rogue ( again )   ,  the future of MI - 6 is under threat  ( again )  and the sinister multinational corporation that ties the  MOVIE_CAST  movies together is just a cabal of highly - placed goons  .   I'm not sure if I'm just one of those nitpicky fans or the MOVIE_STORY was genuinely undercooked  .   Time will tell  .  6 / 10 "}]
