I believe the cast and crew of the maze runner did so effectively and although it may not be a play - by - play of the book it will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next  .   It will have you hooked and waiting for the last movie of the trilogy  ( The death cure )  which may be coming to theatres in 2017  .

I don't get motion sick  .   Mostly I find the constant shaking just down right annoying  .   You get MOVIE_SCENE s of ground or wall or the back of someone's head  ,  instead of an MOVIE_SCENE MOVIE_SCENE that is comprehensible where the audience can see what is taking place  .   I realize the intent is to give a sense of realism  ,  but let's face it ;  we don't see the world shake and move like this when we ourselves run around  .   I would say somewhere around 75 %  of the MOVIE_SCENE was done in shaky cam  .

However  ,  all these features of the Scorch Trials seemed so natural and well written in the book  ,  and not just like ideas which were there because they couldn't come up with anything else  .   for some reason this movie is missing at least half of the important details and scenes that occurred in the book  ,  which made it much more interesting and mysterious  .   They decided to go with the \"Let's put in less detail  ,  and more action\" approach  ,  which clearly didn't work out  .

I don't care about the other IMDb user's review because everything they said was not right  .  This movie is freaking amazing  .  In the end Teresa betraying her friends and all that and that women of WCKD coming in the end  , all of that was a great climax and awesome !  I agree this movie made more questions without answers to our mind and they did that because this MOVIE_STORY is not over !  ! Wait and Watch the next movie ! That's what they are telling us  .    .  Believe me this is amazing and that's why I gave it 10 stars  .  And everyone is entitled to their own opinion  .   "}, {"review": " A lot of this film quite generally did not make sense  .   For example  ,  it just is not explained why there was a point in the maze in the first movie if they were just going to harvest all of the children anyway  .   Also why was WICKED actively working against other groups which were trying to work towards their goal ?  Also  ,  parts of the film it looked like they'd just stolen it straight out of 'I am Legend'  .   The movie also just seemed a bit tiring of  MOVIE_CAST  just being generally an annoying character who constantly made radical decisions and everyone to just accept  .   The MOVIE_SCENE where the lightening strikes were bad also  ,  it literally shocked one of the main characters for him to be unconscious for only a couple of minutes and to regain consciousness and act like nothing happened whatsoever  .  Its things like this that leads this film to just seem like they've tried to make what is clearly a filler movie more exciting by adding in ridiculous scenes  .   It left me cringing all the way though  .   "}, {"review": " This film is dreadful  .   Apart from some clever special effects that may win over very young viewers  ,  the film is awful  .   The MOVIE_STORY line is so predictable  ,  the characters are so stereotypical  ,  the acting is mediocre at best  ,  but by far the worst thing about this film  ,  is the clich\u00e9d lines throughout  .   Without giving too much away  ,  the amount of times the main characters are almost killed  ,  however  ,  while the person with the gun makes the classic Hollywood speech  ,  they themselves are MOVIE_SCENE  by another 'minor' character who was supposed to be a 'baddie'  .   The whole 2 and a quarter hours is full of badly - performed  ,  predictable MOVIE_STORY lines  ,  MOVIE_STORY ue and MOVIE_SCENE .   I have never seen the first Maze Runner  ,  however  ,  I do not intend to  ,  if it was anything as poor as this instalment  .   And from the predictable MOVIE_STORY  ,  it seems there is to be a third  .   I strongly recommend not watching this film  .   A complete waste of my time and money  .

I'm doing this for one reason  -  to possibly save one person like you from wasting their time or money  .   This movie is awful  ,  just awful  .   Crappy zombie rip off with the worst of the Hunger Games added in  .

I understand there has to be some difference from written MOVIE_STORY to movie MOVIE_STORY  ,  but the creators of this MOVIE_STORY paid no true homage to the actual MOVIE_STORY of the book / any of its contents at all  .   If you haven't read the series I guess it's not as much of a loss  .   But as a fan of the series  ,  this movie was actually hard to watch and I will not be seeing the third installment  .   I already know what happens from the books and I can't see any way they could even come back and make it semi - relatable to the books now  .   I love seeing the characters come to life  ,  but some of the MOVIE_ACTOR / actress choices in this movie were not even close to how they were described in the book  .   It was so poorly thought out and disappointing as a fan of the MOVIE_STORY  .   I'm not sure if the author had any say in the book to movie translation  ,  but I feel really bad for him and how his MOVIE_STORY got twisted around  .   Very  ,  very bad movie to the fan of the books  .

There's people out there who hate the filmmakers / writers of this  ,  because they soiled on the book and made it something they didn't want to see  .   Can't comment on that only on how the movie felt  .  And it felt kinda freeing  ( no pun intended )  to some regard  .   Especially after leaving the one location MOVIE_STORY from the first movie  .   A lot of new characters get introduced and some nice MOVIE_ACTOR join in on the act  .   Whether you like it or not will depend on if you know where this is going  .   It's going actually pretty dark and I didn't expect to see those \"creatures\" to be honest  .   The effects are more than decent and the movie has a nice pace to it  ( 15 minutes of outtakes was a bit excessive though  ,  on the disc  ,  but you can tell they had fun making the movie )  "}, {"review": " \"Maze Runner :  The Scorch Trials\" is the sequel of \"The Maze Runner\" and it continues from the point that the Gladers escaped from the maze  .   After their escape they face another obstacles and difficulties in a very hostile environment  .  I have to admit that my expectations about this movie was higher than the first one and that was my mistake  .   Apparently this movie is as I wrote in my title just a transitional stage that guides us to the third movie  .   This movie consists with a lot of new information that makes it a little bit boring  .   This has as a result the MOVIE_SCENE scenes of it to seem not as good as it is  .   The direction of this movie was made by  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  as in the first one  .    MOVIE_CAST  did his best for this movie one more time but this time his interpretation was not enough  .   Lastly I believe that \"Maze Runner :  The Scorch Trials\" is not a bad movie but eventually when it is compared with the first one then its quality is lower  .   The best thing that you have to do is to be prepared and do not have high expectations from this movie  .

Sure many important parts of the MOVIE_STORY were missing and it was a bit confusing and without connecting points sometime but at least it wasn't so violent and negative as the book  .   I did not like how it was against  MOVIE_CAST  all the time  ,  I mean common he was suffering almost throughout the whole book  .   The only bad points in the movie were that the sick people were zombies without explaining how they got sick and what are the stages and also that Teresa was not significant at all in the movie but in the book she played quite crucial role of the betrayer  .

The end was very nicely put together and makes you really happy for the next one  ,  but again if this one wasn't really good than why should the people trust on the new one  .    .

But why do we have to have zombie like \"monsters\" all of a sudden  ,  are they zombies  ,  we never really get to know what they are or why or how  ,  we get bits and pieces  ,  if they are saving the whole MOVIE_STORY for a third I am not so sure it will work  .

So they run away to find the resistance and join them  .   However the road to freedom is spread with zombies  .   One thing you have to keep in mind is the MOVIE_STORY of the first film and that the Scorch Trials has nothing to do with the first movie other than that  .   It's more of a post apocalypse zombie movie  .   WCKD are the bad guys  ,  but someone can't help but ask  ,  what if they aren't ?  Sure their methods are extreme  ,  but they are trying to find the cure  ,  don't they  .   Is  MOVIE_CAST  in the end way too selfish to not want to help find the cure  ,  when he can easily die at the outside world anyway ?  The end does help put those thoughts at ease and I'm glad that they did  .

I loved the books I would give them 9 / 10  ,  because of this I was very excited when the film came out but this film didn't do the books justice and went completely off on a tangent and ignored some very important things  .   Very disappointed and won't be bothering with the next film  .   I would read the books again and again but I won't even be watching this film again  .  If you enjoyed the first film I would recommend the books as there are a lot more interesting things that happen in the rest of the series  .

When the first zombies appear  ,  the first thing I thought was \"they have got out of original ideas\" and that is a pity because it could've become a good film to watch just by following the main principles of the first film  .   It just happens that I feel that the zombie concept has been very stereotyped and when you see one you have seen all  .   There are even several TV series where the main characters are zombies with the same bizarre expressions on the face and the perverse convolutions on their bodies  .  Another disappointment is the attitude of the main character that in most scenes has the same expression of awe in control  .   Strangely enough the director has made these scenes with that same expression unnecessary long which results making the film to seem boring and slow  .  Thus the genre of the film perhaps should evolve from science fiction to horror film  .

A good start which never finished until the end to keep the audience lingering on and on with the expectation of 'something will happen now' which never happened but only a marathon which  MOVIE_CAST  finally decided to finish  .   So this part was dedicated to 'escape' only which they all managed to do in the beginning and that's all  .   My two stars go to CGI makers for some nice cinematic  .

That's pretty much what the new Maze Runner is  .  If you're even moderately intelligent  ,  logically thinking person and not a masochist  ,  please do yourself a favor and don't watch this  .   It's one of the stupidest films of the year  .   What they've done is taken somewhat decent MOVIE_STORY material and turner it into an unwatchable piece of  *  *  *  *   .   "}, {"review": " All through this film I caught myself saying  ,  \"I don't remember this being in the book  .    .    .  I don't remember this being in the book  .    .    .  I don't remember this being in the book  .    .    .  \"I was so looking forward to this film after seeing the original Maze Runner  ,  but came away sorely disappointed  .   If I had not stayed until the bitter end  ,  I would've asked for my money back as it bore little resemblance to the original MOVIE_STORY  .  I'm not holding out hope for the third installment if the same people responsible for this bastardization of the MOVIE_STORY are working on that one as well  .   "}]
