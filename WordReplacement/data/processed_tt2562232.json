That said  ,   MOVIE_CAST  and the cast give wonderful if sometimes overacted performances  .   You can see why critics like it  -  it's not the pap that they are forced to view day in and day out because it's their job to watch it  .   Professional critics  ,  for their own sanity  ,  grasp at any opportunity to promote something different or unusual  .   But just because it's good for them doesn't make it good for us  ,  the casual movie goer  .   Since this is a play within a movie that is set in a theater  ,  I got the feeling that there are inside jokes that those in or familiar with the business  ( such as critics )  will get but which is over the heads the audience  .

Actually to be honest i have now long given up on what critics say and write about a film  .   Virtually critic on both sides of the Atlantic seem to have lost any sense of what is good or bad  .   The amount of critically endorsed films that i have thought to be not bad but very bad seems to be growing each year  .   i have been a serious movie goer for some time now  .   i also have noticed that after a year or so these lauded films seem to get reconsidered   ,  where the original praise is vastly reduced  .

It seems to me that the majority of moviegoers who have chosen to review here are only capable of viewing a movie at face value  .  This movie is clearly a satirical look at Hollywood and the constant need to remain relevant in the entertainment industry  .  I will admit that the film does appear unnecessarily \"artsy\" in places  ,  but some Hollywood MOVIE_ACTOR love being unnecessarily artsy as they think it gives them depth  .  That was the entire point of this film  ,  for Hollywood to turn the  MOVIE_SCENE  on itself and expose all of it's own crap  .  What I took from this film is what I have always felt about Hollywood  ,  which is also what I love about it  .   Actors are inherently insecure  ,  which is why they choose to be in an industry where there is a need for constant approval  .   The MOVIE_ACTOR who are worth their salt risk everything to entertain  .    .    .  us  .   For that they will forever have my respect  .

Truly though  ,  'Birdman' is a technical masterpiece  .    MOVIE_CAST  has generally been undermined as an MOVIE_ACTOR  ( despite a few notable roles as Batman or Beetlejuice )  and has instead faced Hollywood picking more acclaimed and popular MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  'Birdman' however might just be his ticket to an Oscar nomination  ,  and possibly even a win  ,  his performance is mesmerising  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR  Gonz\u00e1lez  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  has created a truly spectacular character study that arguably features this year's strongest acting performances  ,  alongside a well -  executed MOVIE_STORY  ,  booming  MOVIE_MUSIC track and a monumental achievement with cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki in which he attempts a Hitchcockian approach  ,  reminiscent of 'Rope'  ,  and displays the MOVIE_STORY through a seemingly single and unbroken sweeping MOVIE_SCENE   .

Put them all together and you have the worst time waster  .   How this piece of crap ended up with any Oscars is beyond any reasonable person  .   This film does not deserve ten lines of opinion but since the site requires it I will add that the three people sitting next to me shared this opinion and in fact chimed in with other negative comments most of which are not fit to print  .   Piece of advise  -  avoid this film like the plague  ,  the measles or the flu  .   I held an Oscar party and everyone who saw the film voted zero on the ballot I prepared  .   You should have heard the moans and curses when Birdman kept winning  .   What do Oscar voters think ?  "}, {"review": " Watched this because the trailer looked great  ,  thats just it  .   The trailer got two stars  .  The whole movie was a build up to nothing like what i was expecting from the trailer  .   * Spoiler *  If you expecting actual super hero stuff  ,  avoid like Ebola  .   The movie was more art and theater  ,  literally that anything i was expecting  ,  big letdown  .  But the acting was good  ,  please read a good synopsis before viewing  ,  else you will regret it  .  Birdman was more like Pigeonman "}]
