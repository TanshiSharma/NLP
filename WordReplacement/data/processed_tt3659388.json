[{"review": " I can't really believe that I just finished watching a  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  science fiction movie and feeling this low  ,  this one never felt like anywhere close to any of his classics  .   This is just nothing but a typical Hollywood s *  *  *   .    MOVIE_CAST  did a poor performance as a character who is caught in a life and death situation  .   He is not scared or emotional but instead he keeps throwing Hollywood typical punch MOVIE_STORY ues on your face like an Avenger hero when you are expecting Science  .   A make - up artist or a  MOVIE_MUSIC  engineer from the set of \"Big bang theory\" would have written better science MOVIE_STORY and MOVIE_STORY ues  .   For me there are plenty of \"WTF\" or \"Seriously ? \" moments in this movie and I wonder what happened to one of the favorite directors of all time  .   Also repetitive high five / triumph scenes where we don't feel anything  .   To brief :  Drag  ,  bad MOVIE_STORY  ,  insensitive emotional scenes  ,  poor acting  ,  very less science  ,  predictable and not at all funny punch MOVIE_STORY ues !  Just YIFY it  ,  don't buy !

The absolute worst flaw is not even all the fake science  ,  nor I'd it the overuse of disco MOVIE_MUSIC or the fact that the astronaut doesn't really get desperate and only makes cheesy jokes  .    .    .   No  ,  it's the fact that China's space program has some secret spaceship which they want to reveal and give up for the eyes of the world to save one unknown American dude  .   That just doesn't make any sense  .   First of all  ,  China could care less  ,  also  ,  why give up a rocket on which you've been apparently working in secret  ,  just to send food up to space ?

Well I just want to reassure you that even though I am among the nerdiest guys on the Internet  ,  I didn't get annoyed from what I saw  .   Not once  .   And if you weren't annoyed by Tom Hanks and his boys killing almost an entire German Division before giving up in 'Save Private Ryan' you won't be annoyed too  .

The film just felt somewhat void and foreseeable  .   I think it lacked suspense and if I may \"planetary or space awesomeness\"  ,  but of course that is not the mood the film aims at  ,  so you can blame me for judging it from my expectations rather than than considering the movie in itself  .   However  ,  to me it seems almost like a movie about Mars had to be made and this is what we got  .

Every sequence is well studied in each detail and there were many plots and twists  .    MOVIE_CAST  was magic in his astronaut role and  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  proofed that he can create other successful films  .

I can only think he was not himself at the time  .    .    .  Other reviewers have already described the numerous aspects of TM that I despised  ,  so may I just add one \"SPOILER ALERT\" I was utterly sickened by the awful use of David Bowie's Starman to accompany part of the film  .   How dared they ?  How did they get David to agree to using it  ,  or was it beyond his control ?  If he watched this trashy film he must have felt truly embarrassed  .  So sad  ,  I liked  MOVIE_CAST  in The Talented Mr Ripley  .  And yes indeed  ,  who approved showing such an obvious body double  .  Also  ,  I'm not that great at guessing what will happen next in films  ,  but even I could see what was coming way before it happened  .   "}]
