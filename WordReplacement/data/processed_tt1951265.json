[{"review": " Let me say it right now ;  I hated this movie  .   It was bad  .   Look  ,  the concept of a being movie cut into two parts just does not work  .   The whole thing felt like a two - hour exposition  .   The first 30 minutes were so damn boring I literally could not stop getting out of focus and move uncomfortably in my seat  .   There really isn't anything special going on as it progresses  ,  too  .   There is war going on  ,  but they do not really show it and it doesn't suck you in  .   It's very slow paced with lots of teenage MOVIE_STORY and not a lot of \"games\" or \"hunger\" as in the previous films  ( which I liked  ,  by the way )   .   And now there's  MOVIE_CAST   MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's acting  ,  which was trying too hard  ( while making lots of weird facial expressions that made me laugh at inappropriate moments )   .   Overall  ,  I think the idea of splitting a movie into two parts ;  thus making the first half boring  ,  isn't a very good one  .   And in this particular movie \"not very good\" is a compliment  .   3 / 10 "}, {"review": " I had never heard the term \"set - up movie\" before today  .   There has definitely been a trend of splitting up a MOVIE_STORY into multiple movies  .   These movies don't have a beginning - middle - end the same way other movies do but at the very least there's some progress  .   The problem with the Mockingjay Pt 1 is not that it's boring or poorly made  .   In fact  ,  there is a lot of excitement in this movie  .   The problem is that from beginning to end there is hardly anything that changes  .   If you look at where the characters are in the beginning and where they are in the end there isn't much that's changed except for what happens in the very end  .   Katniss has been doing things but we haven't seen much of the effects of her MOVIE_SCENE .  I didn't dislike this movie that much despite it's slow beginning  .   I just can't give this my seal of approval when I left the theater feeling like I saw half a movie  .   By the time the MOVIE_STORY gets its payoff my memory of this movie will be worn - off  .   "}, {"review": " Like watching paint dry  .   Boring to a mind - numbing degree  .   How many times can we see Katniss be horrified and / or emotionally distraught ?  Maybe the filmmakers thought they were adding depth to their characters  .   Well  ,  they were wrong  .   Instead we  ,  the audience  ,  sit through one MOVIE_SCENE after another in which really nothing happens at all  .   This whole thing could have easily been compressed down to 40 minutes and then we could have had the rest of the book as the rest of the film  .   This felt very much like they were stretching it out so they could make two movies  -  which is the new thing to do in Hollywood with these franchises  .   Not good MOVIE_STORY  .   "}, {"review": " I am so disappointed of the movie  .   And that's because there happens close to nothing  .   At nearly every point you notice it's stretched for making out of one book two movies  .   At the beginning I liked it  ,  because many parts of the book found their way into the movie  .   But I realised transferring the MOVIE_STORY of a book 1 : 1 into a movie isn't that good  .   ( NO SPOILER )  As an example they need about 5 - 10 minutes just to go down a staircase  ,  back upwards because \"missing\" something and down again  .   And nothing really happens  .   All the time absolutely no excitement rose in me and I just got bored  .   And I am pretty sure this should be a part where your heartbeat is meant to been rising  .  Sure there are some nice and decent scenes but most of the stuff is just lame  .   In the book it works but clearly not in the Movie  ( plus the showdown of the book is missing because of the split )   .  But at least I enjoyed the MOVIE_SCENE of  MOVIE_CAST  and Philip Seymour Hoffman  ,  which lifted the Movie \"up\" to 3 Stars  .   I hope the last one gets back on the level of the first two movies  .   "}, {"review": " Great acting from the cast ;  especially  MOVIE_CAST   MOVIE_DIRECTOR   ,  the characters were as believable and entertaining as they were in previous films  ,  this is pretty much the highlight of the film  .  The MOVIE_STORY however was dull and uneventful  ,  as in nothing really went anywhere  .   in the majority of the film there was no tension ;  for the most part it was basically \"stuff happens in a bunker for 2 hours :  The Movie  .  \" which is super disappointing because although I haven't read the books ;  I'm told by people that have that they skipped a bunch of the MOVIE_SCENE and downplayed the apparent love triangle  .  If you wanted an MOVIE_SCENE packed flick like the first two or you are the type of fan who doesn't like stuff in the book to be left out  ,  you will be sorely disappointed as this is clearly a filler movie to get some extra  $  $  $  before the series ends  .  wait for DVD  .   "}, {"review": " This movie was extremely dull and boring  .   You could probably skip watching this movie in the series and you wouldn't miss much  .   The MOVIE_STORY was dragged out so much that I found myself shifting in my seat and just waiting for it to end  .  The acting was especially bad and I was cringing at the amount of clich\u00e9 lines  .   My friends and I were also really surprised by such a lack of chemistry between Katniss and Peta ;  their relationship is so forced and I had difficultly even caring about the characters because they are so underdeveloped  .   So many scenes were completely unnecessary ;  they added nothing to the MOVIE_STORY and were just there to take up time  .   Mockingjay was extremely disappointing even though I went in with low expectations  .   2 / 10  ,  would not recommend  .   "}, {"review": " The first movie was fresh and entertaining  .   I've been dragged by my partner to watch the second one which I actually enjoyed until the end when I realized it was not finished yet  .   The Hunger Games :  Mockingjay Part 1 is simply a jock  .   I've never been so much bored from a movie and at some point I really considered leaving the theater  .   The pace is slow  ,  the acting terribly poor and every single MOVIE_SCENE predictable  .    MOVIE_CAST   MOVIE_DIRECTOR 's character has been stretched to the maximum  .   All she does is crying and pretending all movie long  .  I will not watch the part 2 in theater nor on TV as we all already know what will happen  .   This movie is perfect if you want to feel frustrated  ,  disappointed and tricked  .   "}, {"review": " The Huger Games has clearly grown up in Mockingjay  .   Social criticism is much stronger than previous movies  .   Films theme is much more brooding and ominous than before  .   But that doesn't save this picture totally  .   Dividing the movie in two parts is clearly a huge mistake  .   Many MOVIE_SCENE are way too long and some of them are clearly just vain  .   Topmost feeling is just making more money  .   It would be much better to make only one movie instead of two  .   One three hour long movie is much easier to keep together  ,  than two over length movies  .   It is clearly Hollywood's greed to capitalize on movie  ( and book )  series fans  .   How many times more the audience will accept that ?   MOVIE_CAST  Lawrece is great at her role as Katniss  ,  but somehow  MOVIE_CAST  as Peeta's role as brainwashed puppet doesn't convince  .   There is a lot of good elements in this movie so it is a shame that Hollywood want just get few more money from the fans  .   Mockingjay part 1 is despite that quite eligible movie that end up in green money making  .   Good movie ends up to mediocre MOVIE_SCENE flick and that is shame  .   "}, {"review": " I liked the Mockingjay movie  ,  and saw some  ( on message boards and blogs and sh ! t )  mention Battle Royale 2 :  Requiem  .   I believe \"Ripped off\" was the words used  .   Hitherto  ,  I had not known there was a sequel to the great Battle Royale movie  ,  so I got around to watching BR2 today  ,  and I'm rather convicned they're pretty much identical movies  .   They both feature the kids forced to kill each other  ,  in a controlled environment  ,  that go on to take part in a revolution  ,  but before that  ,  there is all the stuff about Noriko's brainwashing and the propaganda war  ,  even the road full of skeletons looked like it was taken from the same storyboard  .   Battle Royale 2 seemed to be about control of a population through violent entertainment  ,  exactly like Mockingjay  .   But why did they leave off the MOVIE_STORY ?  Note that BR2 had not captivated audiences as did BR1  .   So  ,  while I really liked Battle Royale 2  ,  I only kinda liked Mockingjay  .   I'm sure others will have their own preference  .   "}, {"review": " Literally  ,  each and every character  ,  most of the MOVIE_SCENE scenes  ,  and MOVIE_STORY s in the film are inspired  ,  or say blatantly copied from the Japanese Battle Royale II film  .    .   You name a character  ,  you got him in this film  .   Even the background score is lifted from BR and BR2  .   And the worst part is that this plagiarism didn't pay off in the end  .   The MOVIE_SCENE was very poor  .   MOVIE_SCENE sequences looked too much fabricated  ,  super slow  ,  and lacked depth  .   It's a congery of B - grade  MOVIE_SCENE  effects  ,  melodrama  ,  and toothless humor  .  Final word :  If you're are an eleven year old with no Hollywood experience  ,  it's a treat for you  .   Or else  ,  don't bother watching it  .   "}, {"review": " This is by the most boring movie I've seen this year  .   The production company just want to squeeze money out of people like me who apparently had nothing to do this Saturday afternoon but to watch a movie that maybe is okay ~  ~  Alright  ,  let me simply tell u why this is complete crap  .   Story is non -  existent  .   Loop wholes as big as Twilight  .   Boring emotional MOVIE_SCENE with lame monologue  .  I think a law should be passed to forbid producing so many sequels for a single movie  .   It just make use of people's desire to finish something and the recognition from the first  .    .   Frankly I would rate this movie zero star if I can  .   Yup  ,  one more thing  ,   MOVIE_CAST   MOVIE_DIRECTOR  performance was actually OK  .

There's not much to be happy about in \"Mockingjay  , \" which shouldn't come as a surprise if you've read the book  ( it's pretty depressing )   .   Much of the film plays out in District 13  ,  a secret underground bunker revealed in last year's \"The Hunger Games :  Catching Fire\" that's led by President Coin  ( Julianne Moore )   .   Unlike the previous two films  ,  \"Mockingjay\" doesn't have a whole lot of MOVIE_SCENE  .   Katniss fires off only one arrow throughout the film from her now iconic bow  .   The first movie of this year that I kept checking the clock for movie to end   .   It was so boring   ,  I felt like I just watch 1 / 4 of the MOVIE_STORY line   .

I am a 40 yo straight male and this movie did not interest me in any way for even a second  ,  the woman I went with is 21 and she loves this crap ( it was very hard for me to hide my disgust in both the movie and her )  The performances were over the top and terrible  ,  particularly the homosexual host character  .   This character has surely set homos back 10 years   ,  I really thought we were beyond this  .
