The bad guys get no sympathy as carnage ensues and  MOVIE_CAST  is great as the relentlessly cold killer  .   This film is the taken sequel that has never happened !   MOVIE_CAST  gets to play a heartless bad guy and mafioso style boss who's son is the primary goal of Wick's MOVIE_STORY  .   I disagree with those who say there is no MOVIE_STORY to this film  ( some of the same people liked speed which is  ,  and always has been  ,  simply awful !  )  and I think the characters are reasonably well thought out and the acting good for a film of this genre  .   Overall  ,  a very entertaining MOVIE_SCENE thriller  .   "}, {"review": " Haven't seen a nice MOVIE_SCENE movie of  MOVIE_CAST  since the Matrix  .   I enjoyed every minute of it ! Sure the MOVIE_STORY seems a lot like a classic case of \"ex super ultra assassin being a one man army\" but it is well structured and never leaves you bored  .   The atmosphere is good and gives the feeling of a city that is governed by a crime syndicate  .   Acting is quite good compared to other recent MOVIE_SCENE movies I saw lately  .   I hope  MOVIE_CAST  continues to star in more good movies because he was quite unseen during the last decade or so with very few exceptions  .   At first I was sceptical about the rating I saw but after watching the movie I think it deserves it !  "}, {"review": " So the whole idea of justice and epitome of first - world problems goes to the fantastic MOVIE_STORY of invincible Kiwi  MOVIE_CAST  who starts going all crazy killing everyone in the world over a car which he gets replaced for free and a dog he didn't really like and had around for two days  .   Despite the fact that the dog was a gift from his freshly dead wife  ,  he chucked some blankets on the floor and took it off the bed  .   The same man who had no feelings over the dog had no feelings expressed when his best buddy got killed  .   Are viewers supposed to root for such a spoiled rich boy  .   Are viewers supposed to believe that a hit - man incapable of loving can all of a sudden switch to his cell phone video of his wife and think about her from time to time ?  Kiwi's character is full of contradictions like the movie for a 5 year old  .   "}]
