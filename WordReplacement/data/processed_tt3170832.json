[{"review": "  * Insert all 9  & amp ;  10 reviews here *  I was in awe during the entire film  .    MOVIE_DIRECTOR   & amp ;  the MOVIE_STORY team made sure there was not one dull moment  .   The addition of \"insignificant\" characters and MOVIE_STORY twists are later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film alive throughout its duration  .   It was the little things that made this MOVIE_STORY one of the best I've seen in a long time  .   I experienced an entire palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of curiosity and reflection  .   Very few films have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credits  .   Room is endless in the most beautiful way  .

What film doesn't have small flaws  ,  they pale into insignificance during the 2 hours of continuous emotional maelstrom that follows  .   This film wrings every last drop of emotion and MOVIE_STORY out of the allotted playtime  .   Make no mistake  ,  despite short bursts of touching serenity  ,  this films starts up full throttle and doesn't let - up  .   I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or less must be Vulcan by birth  ,  or just terminally insensitive  .   This is a first rate MOVIE_STORY with stand out performances all round  .   Especially from the child protagonist  .    *  * Warning *  *  If you have trouble viewing emotionally charged material of a sensitive nature about abuse  .   You would be well advised not to view this film  .   "}, {"review": " Too many tears  ,  too much sadness  .   Story of a teenager Ma kidnapped  ,  raped and made a mom  .   And mom and son Jack locked in a room away from the world  .   Really sad when Jack said I don't want to be 5 I want to be 4  .   Even a 5 year old wants continued happiness in simplicity and in the arms of his only friend his own mother  .   He wants to be breast fed   ,  he wants to shower with his Ma  .   He enjoys the only place he knows for his first 5 yrs of his life  .   There is no chaos from the real person he knows  .   Ma wants Jack to rescue them from the room  .   Life outside the room has its' own problems of tears  ,  cries  ,  fights  .  Excellent MOVIE_STORY by Emma Donoghue who wrote the novel and the MOVIE_SCENE  .    MOVIE_CAST  as Jack and  MOVIE_CAST  as his mother Ma are terrific  .   Every MOVIE_SCENE  ,  every MOVIE_STORY ue has sincerity  .   Oscar worthy MOVIE_SCENE  .   Oscar worthy acting   .   Joan Allen as Ma's mom and Jack's grandma is perfect grandma  ,  loving  ,  caring  ,  sensitive and excellent  .   Definite Oscar nominees  .    MOVIE_CAST    ,  so young and so perfect in every MOVIE_SCENE  .

The kid is easily the best part in this movie  .   He is very good in his role and could have been nominated for a high - ranked award  .   I also liked Tom McCamus  .   Very nice low - key role  .   I thought I knew him from somewhere  ( and not just because he looks like Lou Reed )   -  He was in POSSIBLE WORLDS  ( great movie )   ,  got pretty old since then  .  The movie is slow and simple  .   I expected a much smarter MOVIE_STORY  .   The lead actress is OK  ,  but I don't think it's Oscar material  .   "}, {"review": " Unique MOVIE_STORY line  ,  moving  ,  and great acting  .   The kid gives a beautiful and very convincing performance  ,  especially during the more emotional scenes  .   But after they escape  ,  it's mostly just melodrama where the daughter accuses the Dad of not caring and the mom says the daughter is inconsiderate of her feelings  ,  etc  .   2 / 3 of this film is very reminiscent of some sappy ABC Family MOVIE_STORY  ,  like The Fosters  .   If you are a fan of The Fosters  ,  you might enjoy Room  ,  as the two are equally as boring  .   I also dislike the way this movie antagonizes journalists and portrays them as close - minded vultures  .   During the interview  ,  the reporter seems to victim - blame and provoke  MOVIE_CAST 's character  ,  which is something no professional  ,  ethical reporter would do under that context in real life  .

The movie centers around their escape and life in the world thereafter  .   As you would expect  ,  it makes for a tense couple of hours of viewing but the viewer is rewarded in the end  .   The heartwarming relationship between mother and son is what makes this movie  .  'Room' is a gripping movie that will take you on a roller - coaster of emotions  ,  but it's well worth the ride  .   "}, {"review": " \"Room\" shares the innocent perspective of a 5 year old named Jack who is led to believe by his mother that life consists of being inside a tiny room forever  .  I can relate this movie with \"Life Is Beautiful\" and \"Pan's Labyrinth\" because in all this titles we see a young human with such an innocent perspective and big imagination that somehow softens the cruel reality by tricking the mind and distorting what is actually happening  .  \"Room\" also shows the psychology of both of the primary characters after living through a traumatic experience  .   Jack not being able to walk upstairs since he had never done it before in Room is one example  .  This movie made me feel grateful about my life because you get to see Jack and his mother happy after all  .   Torwards the MOVIE_STORY of the movie Jack says \"since Ma and I don't know what we like  ,  we decided we are going to try everything\"  .   That's my favorite part of the movie because it means Jack is finally ready to open himself up and be a part of the big world  .   "}, {"review": " It's too long and it gets very very boring some times  .   There are a lot o movies which exploit much better this idea In the beginning of the movie there is not even a clue what is going on but i guess this is a movie trick used by the director  .  It's not about the fact that they have not escaped in those years  .   It's about the fact that the movie  , after they escape shows a very little preoccupation for the true situation of the characters  , of the inside fight  .   At least it is a better candidate for the Oscar prize  ,  but it is not a movie which deserves a position in top 250 or to be nominated for Oscars  .   It is good when you put it besides the big short  , spotlight  , the revenant  , bridge of spies  ,  but come on  .    .    .   I hope Mad max will have a serious chance for winning the prize "}, {"review": " The concept was a good one to take on as there have been a number of high profile abduction cases over the past twenty years or so  .   But I wasn't totally convinced with the MOVIE_STORY on this one  .  It was a good effort in showing the psychological problems and scars that the victims are left with  .   For me  ,  the best part of the movie was the last 15 minutes  -  they were the most realistic  .   And the final narration by the young lad was well written  -  but a five year old wouldn't be that eloquent  .   The first half of the MOVIE_STORY based in the room didn't really work well in my estimation  .  Despite that  ,  all the major players did a fine job  ,  although I wouldn't say Oscar worthy  .   I wouldn't recommend people to go the movie theater to see this one  -  you can wait till it comes round on streaming or a movie channel  -  or Red Box  .

In this Emma Donogue's adaptation  ,  we  MOVIE_SCENE ize the ugly side of it  ,  where dreams do not exist  ,  and that any kid would like to erase from his mind  .  For Jack  ,  5 years of age  ,  in the shoes of Jack Trembley  ,  the room is all there is  .   His entire childhood contained in four walls  ,  and the unconditional love of her \"ma\"  (  MOVIE_CAST  )   .  This movie was a complete challenge  ,  in terms of narrative  ,  a humble room  ,  where a mother and her son switch MOVIE_STORY ues to tell us a true MOVIE_STORY  .   At certain points one might think it goes slowly  ,  but it manages to finish in a great way  .  This film was greatly promoted and backed by outstanding supporting MOVIE_ACTOR such as William H  .

The general idea is explained fairly quickly  ,  though the why of the closed space or rather location and the reason for staying might take a while to sink in  .  If you already know some of the whys because of the trailer or reading the MOVIE_STORY  ,  don't be afraid though  .   The movie moves forward and it does not stay stagnant at all  .   That is true regarding the MOVIE_STORY  ,  but the characters have some other issues to solve  .   Talking about solving  ,  you won't get all the answers for this  ,  but this is a pretty good and strong depiction psychologically speaking of what persons go through  ,  without getting into their heads  .

This is an incredible film with fantastic performances from the 2 leads  .    MOVIE_CAST  is  ,  as is always the case  ,  excellent  ,  but is blown away by an unbelievable performance from young  MOVIE_CAST   .   It can only be because of his tender years that he didn't receive Oscar recognition as I don't believe we will see a better performance this year  .   Of course a lot of the credit for this must go down to fantastic direction from  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   .   As for the film  ,  it is abhorrent  ,  terrifying  ,  warm  ,  emotional  ,  uplifting and life affirming  ,  and not necessarily in that order  .   Your emotions change from one way to another many times throughout the run time  .

Room is one of those movies that i almost hated it the first 20 or maybe 25 minutes or so bored me to death and seeing a boy with long hair looking like a girl truly made me laugh but as the film goes on i found out that it's actually pretty great seeing this mother played by  MOVIE_CAST  doing everything in her power to save her kid Jack played by  MOVIE_CAST  was really inspiring in a way and if you erase those 20 - 25 minutes the film is really great the performances by the 2 leads are really great and it's a powerful MOVIE_STORY as well but also the characters are well written and interesting and that's why i'm going to give the Room an 8 / 10  .

I was very impressed at the way this film was played out and was delivered  .   Imagine being a five year old boy who has only known an enclosed room his entire life and then escapes and live through the aftermath of it  .   This sets the stage for a brilliant film  .   At times I did want Ma  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  to whip Jack  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  during and after the imprisonment and I did find myself getting angry with Ma  (  MOVIE_CAST  )  after their escape  .

I am not that kind of a person who likes to write much or review  ,  but this is an master piece of art  ,  it so much reminds me of \"Danny the Dog\" movie with so much differences but with a one real similarity of awesomeness  .   I would recommend this movie for everyone who ask about \"Life -  changing stories\" and how the world  ,  facts  ,  inceptions  ,  truth and life shall be imagined  .   This movie is also a need for our time of madness  ,  extremism and all of the terrorism our days are having  ,  since if we all knew and understood the message of that movie ;  we will always be tolerant and understanding differences  .

I honestly can not believe this movie was so engaging  .   The writer and director literally thought of everything  .   I think the reason why this film works as well as it does is purely because of the attention to detail  .   You feel everything the boy does when he sees and understands things for the first time  .   Another thing that the movie excels in is pacing  .   For the past 5 or more years it seems like most movies have had pacing problems  .   This one works well and never rushes or bores you to death  .

This movies is not amazing throughout  .   Once they are free  ,  it is kind of interesting to see that whole transition  ,  but I believe that it is a wast of half the movie  ,  it starts to drag on without meaning or a definite mission / goal  .   the second part is just pointless  .

In Room 2015 they displayed perfect acting  ,  a beautiful  ,  yet thrilling MOVIE_STORY ;  the concept of this film was on point in all ways  .  Room is one of those films that everyone should check out  ,  the way the team put it all together just couldn't have been any better ;  perfection to say the least  .   Room  ( 2015 )  is a film in which will be in our tops for a very long time  .   "}, {"review": " So finally here is one cinematic experience of a lifetime  .  It starts in a claustrophobic tone  ,  gradually cheers up and finally ends up in an introspective mood  .  The basic idea of the movie is how we adjust ourselves in different circumstances  .  Things can be easy even when the externals are odd  .  Things can be tough even when everything is a bed of roses  .  It is up to us and how we cope with the change  .  And only the brave can fight it back to normalcy  .  This is what you call a layered MOVIE_STORY  ,  interwoven with human emotions like joy  ,  sadness  ,  madness  , depression and sense of freedom  .   MOVIE_CAST  as Joy  ( Ma )  is brilliant  .  Her expressions  , change of tone  , hysteria  , eyes lit up the character and its pleasures and agonies  .  Deservedly she bagged the coveted Academy Award  .  Joan Allen as the sensitive grandmother does a brilliant job  .  But it is the kid Jacod  MOVIE_CAST  who steals the show  .  He is too brilliant MOVIE_ACTOR for a kid of his age  .  His narration towards the end of the movie makes your eye moist  .  The other casts do justice to their small roles  .  'Room' is a winner all through  .

How the director  ,  like a painter on a canvas  ,  keep adding details to their lives  .  From our narrow point of view  ,  we can appreciate and comprehend how strong and clever this girl is  ,  how thoughtful she has been for shrinking her son's world to just one Room  ,  protecting him from excruciating reality of her kidnapping and daily rape  .  The movie depicts well the aftermath too  ,  where pressure relief destabilise her mind while the kid  ,  who were none the wiser  ,  can't figure out the reason of his mother's sudden behavioural change  .  So  ,  for crying it out loud  ,  it's a very pleasant movie with a wonderfully cured psychological part  .  Enjoy it  .

Once they had escaped  ,  with barely half the running time elapsed  ,  all the tension went out of the film  .   I was sitting there thinking  -  okay  ,  so what is going to happen to fill the next fifty minutes ?  The answer ?  Pretty much nothing  ,  sadly  .  Don't get me wrong  ,  the final MOVIE_SCENE was very moving  ,  but I still got the feeling that the movie peaked during the escape and then just sort of ambled around for the remainder  .   which is a great shame  ,  because I was really enjoying it up until that point  ,  not least the stunning turn from the young MOVIE_ACTOR playing the kid  .  I think I understand what the film was trying to achieve in being structured the way that it was  ,  it just didn't work for me personally  .   I'm actually quite a fan of non - linear plots  ,  and maybe that's something that would have enabled the director to keep building the tension to the very end whilst still showing us the aftermath of the ordeal  .

The ability of Ma to keep Jack curious  ,  to teach him  ,  and protect him  -  to well presented  .   The MOVIE_STORY is so good  .   You are presented the aftermath of the events and they are presented with such probable truth  .   To go back to a world that is different that you had at 17 and then a 5 yr  .   old being able to experience it for the first time  -  well done  .   I am glad I saw it  -  wish I had seen it when it first can out  -  but will never forget this film  .   "}, {"review": "  ( spoilers )  Directed with competence and subtlety by  MOVIE_DIRECTOR   ,  \"Room\" is winning direction with good score and great acting from leads  ,  especially  MOVIE_CAST   ( young Jack )   .   The claustrophobia of the first 45 min wears a bit  ,  but the filmmakers redeem themselves with an excellent 2nd half of adaptation and re - circulation into society  .   Camera angles  ,  brightness  ,  and blurriness  ,  including  MOVIE_MUSIC  muffling are all masterfully distorted and adjusted to impart the strange distress the boy gets put through when transitioning  .   The MOVIE_STORY  is not far - fetched or pandering  .   Indeed  ,  the movie was very good  ,  adapted from the novel with the same author creating the MOVIE_SCENE as well  .   7  .  5 / 10  ( recommended )  "}, {"review": " From the first moment I started watching this film  ,  it caught my full attention  .   The MOVIE_STORY line is so powerful and vulnerable at the same time I couldn't help but thinking this is one of the best films I've seen in the last year or two  .   What I found most enchanting personally was the connection Ma' and Jack had throughout the entire film  .   The world Ma' had created for Jack to grow into despite her own tragic fate was beyond words  .   But what really broke me is the second part of the film  ,  when both are free and out in the real world again  .   That's when emotions start hitting Ma' the way they should all those years she stayed strong for Jack in Room  .   The suicide attempt for me was the peak of the MOVIE_STORY !  The chemistry between  MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_CAST  on and off set is undeniable  .   The two of them created something so strong  ,  and pure and sincere  ,  I think that was the main reason this film got so far  ,  and people got so stunned  .   I recommend it for anyone who is up to an emotional  ,  powerful experience  .   MAGNIFICENT FILM FOLKS !

The MOVIE_STORY is well told and intimately enveloped \u0096 both inside the room  ,  as they cope and survive  ,  and outside  ,  as they adjust to a normalized life \u0096 and it has its moment of prisoner poetry  ,  but it keeps it light on the MOVIE_STORY strings as it filters the heaviness of psychological anguish through the prism of a 5 - yr old boy  .   This could be seen as properly measured  ,  of course  ,  and preferable to most viewers  ,  but I'd expect a more incisive and explorative recount  ,  with all the squalor and darkness such abuse and rehabilitation would entail  ,  before the opening to a new life  .   One also wonders about the missed chances of making enough noise to be noticed  ,  and I spotted an obvious stylistic error in the  MOVIE_SCENE  vehicle's shadow as it follows the captor's truck  .

I wouldn't have been surprised if the movie had been just about the time spent in Room with an escape finale  ( the typical on this subject )   ,  but being able to get a glimpse of life outside hell from more than one perspective  ,  made the movie complete  .   I've read the reviews that said the movie is about nothing  .   It's true  .   It's about nothing but inner struggle  ,  nothing but constant moving on  ,  nothing but parental worries & amp ; strategies & amp ; love  ,  nothing but inner conflicts  ,  nothing but life  .

It really is a movie that the masses can relate to  .   Anyone can find a way to relate to this  .   It is a film about a mother and son bond  .   I also love that the author of the book also wrote the MOVIE_SCENE  ( love seeing a female screenwriter !  )  It's nice that she got to choose what parts of her MOVIE_STORY were shown on screen  .

Jack's first time seeing the real world was magical and terrifying at the same time  .   I couldn't even imagine the sensory overload  .   Then they both arrived at Jack's grandmother's house  .   Events here seemed to unfold choppily  .   There was no clear direction  .   Before  ,  Jack and Ma's goal was to escape Room  .
