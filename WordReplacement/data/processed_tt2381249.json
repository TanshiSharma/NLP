At the half way  ,  I got a hunch that Elsa would die in the movie after fallen in love with Hunt  .   But that did not happen  .   Anyway  ,  i found the MOVIE_STORY very engaging and the movie in a list of must watch this year  .   "}, {"review": " I so enjoyed this movie and it is MOVIE_SCENE packed  .   The MOVIE_STORY was great and I was not disappointed  .   Been a big fan of JJ Abrams since the show Alias so am not surprised on how well this came out  .   All the staff and crew are to be commended  .   Can only hope for some Oscar nods  .   The Oscars never seem to give much attention to high explosive movies like M I but they really should  .  It has been several years since I thought enough of a movie to return for a second viewing but I may just do that  .   What I liked most was the MOVIE_STORY keeps moving  .   It starts with MOVIE_SCENE  ,  taking you through several countries  ,  and ends in a good place  .    .    .  I do not wish to give away the entire MOVIE_STORY  .   You can judge for yourselves  .   I would like to think in this place called earth if we were in deep trouble the best agents would work together for the betterment of mankind  .   "}, {"review": " Crucial times lie ahead for the IMF as their superiors question whether the agency is in fact an asset or a nuisance  ,  and pressure is applied from bureaucratic CIA operatives who believe the agency should be disbanded and absorbed  .   This puts veteran IMF agent Ethan Hunt in a precarious position as he attempts a complex assignment to try and eradicate the Syndicate  ,  an elusive and international crime consortium whose capabilities allow them to operate sort of like an 'anti - IMF  .  ' With time running short  ,  Hunt recruits the few loyal members of the IMF to try and complete the task  ,  with lots of unexpected surprises along the way  .   The cast makes the most of the material but there are so many twists  ,  turns  ,  double - crosses  ,  and cover - ups\u0097which are intended to be slick and suspenseful\u0097but instead just end up dragging out the MOVIE_STORY and making it a lot more convoluted than it needs to be  .   Some key MOVIE_SCENE set pieces  ,  MOVIE_SCENE work  ,  gadgetry  ,  and  MOVIE_SCENE  effects do make it worth the price of admission  ,  but it never has quite the impact that its immediate predecessor does  .    *  * \u00bd "}, {"review": " I loved Mission :  Impossible Rogue Nation as much as the previous movies of the MI franchise  .   Thanks to  MOVIE_CAST  and  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  for giving the audiences an MOVIE_SCENE - packed  ,  adrenaline pumping experience which included  MOVIE_CAST 's death - defying stunts like hanging outside an aircraft and despite the risks  ,  he pulled it off as usual because he's a real MOVIE_ACTOR who always gives 100 percent in every movie he does  .   The cast is amazing including  MOVIE_CAST   ,   MOVIE_CAST   ,  Ving Rhames and  MOVIE_CAST   .   Forget Bond and Bourne because Ethan Hunt is the best secret agent ever  .   I give Mission :  Impossible Rogue Nation 10 stars and looking forward to see the sixth mission  .   "}, {"review": " I have always liked the Mission - movies :  characters are elaborated  ,  performances are at least good  ,  the MOVIE_STORY is frisky  ,  the venues are diverse and MOVIE_SCENE scenes do not create blah !  feelings  .    .    .   Of course  ,  there are lots of references to many other and more famous movies  ,  including James Bond ones  ,  but I like that the attitude / mood is non -  serious  ,  not \"bulked out\"  ,  even in respectable places like Vienna Opera  .    .    .   And inclusion of new and international MOVIE_ACTOR  ,  e  .  g  .   Jens Hult\u00e9n  ,  and places  ,  e  .  g  .   Morocco  ,  Austria  ,  provides the movie with broader background  ,  bringing the viewers away from narrow despondency  .   And  -  last but not least  -  all the cast is great again  ,  even smaller parts are played with non - random performers  .   True  ,  in my opinion  ,   MOVIE_CAST  was overshadowed by  MOVIE_CAST   -  but \"nerdy\" characters are often funnier than real \"actionists\"  .    .    .   "}, {"review": " To say that \"Rogue Nation\" is the best entry in Mission :  Impossible franchise is to say a soft compliment  .   It's a majestic blend between pop corn blockbuster  ( lacking MOVIE_STORY )  and an MOVIE_SCENE spectacle with MOVIE_STORY  ( usually lacking a big scoop in most movies )   .   Well  ,  this one has it all  .   I had the honor to see this outing at the cinema and it was mind - blowing  .   The MOVIE_SCENE and the stunts are practical  ,  without abusing CGI and so well choreographed that doesn't need to expand it all  .   The MOVIE_STORY mixed the pace of the fourth installment with the suspense of the first one giving a perfect pay off in its last 30 minutes  ( full of breathtaking twists and real surprises )   .    MOVIE_CAST  is at the top of his game but the real standout is  MOVIE_CAST   .   If the next installments come as bright as this one I'll be delightfully  .   But if they fail by any chance  ,  we will always have this adventure to remind us how high the M : I franchise set the bar  .   "}, {"review": " It's really a feat to make that many movies / entries into a series  ( especially one that builds on a TV show )  and keep the quality on a higher standard  .   There are things that are clich\u00e9 and things seem to repeat themselves  ( watch the Honest trailer made for this series by \"screenjunkies\" )   ,  but it still works  .   It might be the enthusiasm  MOVIE_CAST  brings to the table and therefor the talent he hires to keep this on a top level  .  The MOVIE_SCENE scenes always were good  ,  that doesn't change with this  .   You get some familiar faces from previous entries  ,  though also new people  ( female lead to name one )   .   The mixture is good  ,  and even though we know  MOVIE_CAST s character is good  ,  we have to endure others who don't quite get it at first   .    .    .   which makes for some interesting if predictable turns during the movie "}]
