The effects were decent but lets be honest  ,  which movie doesn't have decent effects nowadays ?  The acting is absolutely horrific  ,  the rock has the acting ability of a disabled fox and I wanted the two English toff kids to die every time they appeared on the screen  .  The girl in it  ,  although very attractive  ,  has the personality of a sprout  .  Bah !  if anyone offers to watch this movie in your presence please punch them in the face  .

The last good disaster movie I saw was The Towering Inferno  ,  and you know that was a long  ,  long time ago  .   It's still my favorite disaster flick  .   San Andreas  ,  of course  ,  had much better special effects  .    ( several decades later  ,  better effects  ,  right ?  )  I thought the scenes of the destruction were amazing  .

Why do they always have Brits in American films who  MOVIE_MUSIC  like they are so posh ?  Totally not called for  .   The acting was OK and I like  MOVIE_CAST   ,  but this was beneath him  .

Reminds me of when 3D movies came out in the early 80's  -  bad movies where they tried to throw everything and anything at the screen  ,  but lacked a MOVIE_STORY  .

It will work for most of the do - do's out there  ,  but otherwise will fall flat for most  .   I should add  ,  that \"hey !

So I give credit to those involved in all of that computer work  .   But the MOVIE_STORY ue writer and acting coaches should be hiding in shame  .   Most films of this genre call for a willing suspension of belief but this one calls for a \"What the H E double hockey - sticks f'ing unbelievable surrender  .  \" Once you accept that premise and just settle back to watch the Hoover Dam and San Francisco tumble down as our hero does the impossible  ,  then you can just enjoy the architectural carnage  .

The Rock  ,  who plays a firefighter  ,  sets out to rescue his family after a powerful earthquake hits San Francisco  .   In some ways  ,  this movie looks like an imitation of 2012  ( 2012 )   .   There are similar computer generated scenes of massive destruction  ,  aircraft maneuvering through falling buildings  ,  massive tsunami waves carrying ships onto land and so on  .   Acting is just fine  ,  MOVIE_STORY is very narrow  ,  and overall the movie is full of cinematic clich\u00e9s  .   Nevertheless  ,  watching it on big screen in 3D is definitely going to thrill the audience  .   "}, {"review": " If aliens and a T - Rex had appeared out of the San Andreas fault and transformed all the tomatoes in California into flesh eating bacteria  ,  this movie would have had a chance  .   The MOVIE_STORY is wretched  ,  the MOVIE_SCENE is completely unrealistic  .   All acting talent the performers could must is woefully insufficient to cover the ridiculously juvenile MOVIE_STORY design  .   From the very first MOVIE_SCENE of a girl  ,  a car  ,  a mountain road  ,  and the ridiculous tumble down a mountainside  ,  the movie wreaks of over - reaching effects and underdeveloped characters  .   This movie ranks right down there with Rambo and Missing In MOVIE_SCENE  .   My wife said it best  .    .    .  hokey  .   "}]
