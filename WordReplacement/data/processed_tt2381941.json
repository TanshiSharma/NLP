[{"review": " The title \"Focus\" had potential among the quantitatively declining Con -  Artist genre  .   Although brilliantly centered and set up with a decent cast and setting  -  the execution of intelligent criminal activity was poor and often justifying or explaining trickery and illusion as \"he's just so good at it  .  \"  -  failing to satisfy the audience with an insight into the brilliance that is a con - centered plan  .   I love heist movies  .   I love intricate con movies  .   I love crime movies and I'm sad to say this doesn't really come close to fitting anywhere between those genres best and brightest  .   Instead you're left feeling slightly amused  ,  slightly tired  ,  slightly relieved that it's over but kind of happy you saw it anyway  -  I dread to think how badly this movie would have been were it not for will smith  .

One character in the movie is a big foreigner that comes with the most hysterical \"I am honest and straight forward just to confuse you\" -  type of guy  .   Great !

MOVIE_CAST  is a real find ;  and her chemistry with  MOVIE_CAST  is most convincingly romantic I have seen in this century  .

The poor emotional range demonstrated by the female lead takes away a lot of the energy from the second half of the film  .   The best part of the whole experience is the heavyset supporting MOVIE_ACTOR with several funny moments  .   The makers would have been well advised to allow more  MOVIE_SCENE  time for this guy instead of two mediocre MOVIE_ACTOR that we are supposed to view as cool and sexy  .

The \"thieving\" scenes are immensely fun to watch and the performances are good  ,  however Focus is a prime example of \"style over substance\" and how when a film resolutes as arrogant  ,  its unenjoyable  .
