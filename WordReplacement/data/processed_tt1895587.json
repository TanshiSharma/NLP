In this day of digital news  ,  this movie makes us stand back and realize what we may lose in the way of investigative journalism as we slowly kill off print media  .  The lengths the directors go to to achieve a sense of authenticity is remarkable  .   We are there in Boston in 2001 - 2002  .   We get to know enough about each character to make him or her real  ,  but not enough to create side dramas  .   The focus remains the child abuse scandal in the archdiocese in Boston  .   That reflects the conflict the characters face and deal with when events make them rethink the focus of their article  .  The movie is riveting  ,  though we know the outcome  .

The complicated MOVIE_STORY of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by  MOVIE_DIRECTOR  Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a MOVIE_SCENE to anything less than the MOVIE_STORY or character development  .   I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the MOVIE_ACTOR in their portrayals  .   MOVIE_CAST  seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift  .

Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad  ( and apparently never - MOVIE_STORY )  saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims  .   The acting is all - around fantastic  ,  from Mr  .    MOVIE_CAST  to some MOVIE_ACTOR that I am not familiar with  ,  which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound  .

No doubt it's an important MOVIE_STORY  ,  however I didn't detect any brilliant journalism  -  this is not All the President's Men  ,  nor is it The Verdict where Paul Newman battled against the church  .   Spotlight reporters never stray in the dark or risk anything  -  the MOVIE_STORY is basically handed to them on a silver platter  ,  and they only verify it  .

The fact there's such a rampant systemic issue with an organization as large as the Catholic Church is appalling  .

It's a terrific ensemble  ,  but the fault  ,  I think  ,  lies in trying to give everyone in the ensemble an equal part in the MOVIE_STORY  .   Without making it about one person  ( whether a reporter or a victim )   ,  the emotional impact falls very  ,  very short  .  What the viewer is left with is a general notion of  ,  \"It's shocking that went on for so long and the church kept covering it up  , \" but zero emotional investment and reaction  .

What it doesn't answer is why the Church hierarchy didn't just de -  frock the pedophile priests  ,  rather than move them from parish to parish  .   Kicking them out would have STOPPED the abuse rather than just MANAGING the abuse  .   It would have sent a message to other pedophile priests and actually done something to fix the problem rather than perpetuate it  .   The other question I have is this :  the vast majority of people in all churches and all religions are good people  ,  doing good work with good intentions  .   How could Catholic Church hierarchy have allowed the pedophile priests to remain in the Church when they knew that children were being abused  .   How could they have allowed the children  .   How ?

The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary  .   We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades  ,  but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared  .

I liked that the movie does not make the reporters feel like heroes  ,  they are just people who are doing their jobs  .  I have two minor flaws about this movie  .   It does have some pacing issues  .   The another flaw is that i would have liked to see more things about what happened after the news article  .   That is not probably issue for people who know the scandal better  .  The movie's main point is how important investigative journalism is  .   It shows the importance really well  .

Without reading all the reviews on this site it's a fair bet that most of them are positive cause what's not to like so all I can do is spin out my positive thoughts for the ten lines that IMDb insist upon  .   It's not really on to single out one or even several performances when what we have here is an ensemble performance of the highest standard but the low - key non - sensational aspect is a definite plus and in terms of how newspapers used to be run it's right up there with Richard Brroks' Deadline USA  .   The fact that it is based on actual events painstakingly uncovered by a four - person unit invites comparisons with the great TV series Lou Grant which also featured investigative journalism and if anything this resembles nothing so much as a boxed set of the Best of Lou Grant  .

It shows that every part of it has rotten apples and in the same time people with moral values  .   "}, {"review": " In this Academy Award - nominated film  ,  Spotlight  ( on my Top Ten Films for 2015 )  reveals the 2002 expose into the Catholic Church's scandal of child molestation and rape by priests taking place at least over two decades  .   A team of Boston Globe reporters begins to investigate the history of keeping these reports of sexual assault under the radar  .  \"Spotlight\" is based on the true MOVIE_STORY behind the 2002 expos\u00e9 into the Catholic Church's cover - up of decades of sexual abuse  .   Unflinching in its focus  ,  \"Spotlight\" underscores a subtle outrage and sense of resignation about our institutions' power  .   We watch as the \"Spotlight \" team\u0097named for undercover expos\u00e9s of difficult - to - prove cases -  -  chases down leads ;  goes through archives with missing documents ;  and interviews priests  ,  judges  ,  and victims  .   The investigative Spotlight team at the Boston Globe is defined by their tenacity  ,  not by their personal stories  ,  except for one reporter  .

"}, {"review": " The construction of this film is so traditional that at times it feels old - fashioned  ,  having an almost \"I've seen this all before\" quality  .   Clearly the objective is to deliver the MOVIE_STORY in as efficient a manner as possible  .   No fireworks  .   No  MOVIE_MUSIC track that grabs you by the throat  .   No chewing of the MOVIE_SCENE allowed  .   Remember \"Erin Brockovich\" ?  Julie Roberts wouldn't have known what to do with herself on this set  .   But somehow it all works  .   By some strange alchemy \"Spotlight\" is one of the three most soulful films I've seen this year  .    ( The two others  -  \"Love  & amp ;  Mercy\" and \"Time Out of Mind\"  .   )  Much attention has been given to the performance of the \"good guys\"  ,   MOVIE_CAST   & amp ;  Company  ,  and deservedly so  .   But I thought \"Spotlight\" did a brilliant job of showing the venality of the kind of corruption that allowed the sins of the priests to go unchecked :  The performances of Billy Crudup and Paul Guilfoyle were pitch - black perfect  .   "}, {"review": " This movie is outstanding  .   Everything about it is good  .   I saw it a second time just 48 hours after seeing it the first time  .   I'm not sure I ever have done that before  .   I easily could sit through it again  ,  only 24 hours after having seen it the second time  .  I was a little concerned that it would be a routine Hollywood left - wing bash of the Catholic Church  ,  but instead it was very well written and presented  .   Nothing excessive  ,  overdone  ,  or overstated  .   Nothing understated or whitewashed  ,  either  .   The two writers have a clear understanding of how Catholics view the clergy and why this scandal was devastating for so many of them  .   The movie illustrates the difference between the Catholic faith and the Catholic Church  .  The acting is excellent  .   Not one weak performance  .   I had the feeling that these were people I might know  ,  very real people  .  This movie is one that anyone might find interesting  .   Those raised as Catholics are likely to find it so and should see it  .   "}]
