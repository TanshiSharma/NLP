{"review": "\nI enjoyed the movie so much, that I came onto IMDb and registered\nmyself just so that I can post a review. <br><br>The movie was packed with jaw dropping, eye popping action from\nbeginning to end. The drama had a mix of sadness, comedy and\nseriousness which were all mixed in together so beautifully to give a\nconsistency to keep the viewer starring at the screen and being\ninvolved in the movie rather than daydreaming about other things. <br><br>In my honest opinion I would say that it is the best Fast &amp; Furious\nmovie to date. <br><br>I want to go see it again!<br><br>(by the way, I realise that this isn't the best review in the world or\nmight even be an awful review, the point is that I enjoyed the movie\nthoroughly and felt I should contribute to it's high average ratings).\n"},
{"review": "\nI've been a personal fan of the F&amp;F series ever since the very first\ntitle was released. Once I saw that Fast Five was in production I\nimmediately began hunting down a pass for its first showing, I was\nsuccessful. Fast Five is everything we all love about the franchise,\nfast cars, beautiful women, and of course some nail biting action\nscenes.<br><br>Whether you're a long time fan of the movies, or a brand new viewer,\nthis movie is a must see, you're guaranteed to get your moneys worth on\nthis title.<br><br>Best movie I have seen in a long time, it even managed to remove the\nbad taste that was left in my mouth by Tokyo Drift. <br><br>This is going to be one of the biggest movies of the year, see it, or\nbe left behind.<br><br>Rating- 10/10 -Average Joe\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the\nseries a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the\nprevious films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could\nyou have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist\naction flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really\nadds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah,\nstill the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a\nfranchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really\nhandled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are\nvery charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see\na cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic\nstereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall\na very entertaining action flick.\n"},

Vin Diesel\nand Paul Walker return and are joined by newcomer Dwayne Johnsson for\nthe 5th Fast and Furious Movie, entitled ''Fast Five''. There's not\nmuch to say about this, the action movie of the year, except it's\nfantastic shots of Brazil, the heist plot that brings even more\nexcitem\u00abent to the table and overall the continuation of the story of\nthese characters we have come to love and support, as their bond\nstreghtens over time.<br><br>In Conclusion, if you love the franchise then you can't miss it<br><br>9/10\n"},

{"review": "\nYeah, exactly... They've found the key to the success, I guess. I am so\nappreciated myself for being patient watching the first movies of the\nfranchise. I was welcomed by a gorgeous work as I've hoped since\nwatching Fast &amp; Furious (2009) #4. I advise those who consider starting\nthe franchise to be patient watching the first three nightmares (not\nrecommended to skip them because there are some connection to be needed\nafterwards). It's good to focus on theme of the armed action-thriller\nalso including fight rather than racing-based events. It is also one of\nthe movies at which I laugh much. On the other hand, some scene of it\nis seriously touching. Action, thriller, comedy, dram, doesn't matter\nwhat you're interested in. This installment has all.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie fast five was a very good movie because it had a lot going on\nthrough out the movie. And it has a lot of action which I like because\nit kept you on the edge of your seat because the problems that are\nhappening are interesting. The sound of the cars and everything is\nreally cool because it all combined together well. All the cars and\nracing was very intense and cool. The actors where the best for the\nmovie because they are tough and suit the personalities of the movie\ncharacters. For example, Dom one of the main characters was big strong\nand scary so it showed that the people that are racing the cars have to\nbe tough and scary looking. Then they have Paul walker and he doesn't\nlook like a racer but is and is apart of the family. So overall, the\nmovie Fast Five is a very good movie and deserves good ratings.\n"},
{"review": "\nFast Five best one from the franchise.The other ones we're very good\ntoo. I love Fast and Furious movies they we're always amazing for me.\nNow to the movie it is awesome movie because of the action.The action\nis just amazing and the cars are sweet. Testosterone Rock as a new one\nto the crew is perfect and good old Dome is just bad-ass and Brian he\nis just good.I liked that he has way more action then he had it the\nother movies.Paul Walker wasn't Oscar worthy actor but he did the job\nand i thing that he managed it very well especially the scenes where he\nrage in that way I think he's perfect. So the action is totally perfect\nacting is very good and dialogs are very good too. I love the movie.I\nlove everything about it.It's just Mind blowing movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie still has its feelings of brotherhood and contains a lot\naction and nice cars, although the movie misses street races, the\nnightlife of illegal street racing, like in the first and second fast\nand furious films. There are some mistakes in the storyline that\ndisturbs me, however they are minor errors that are unlikely to be\ndiscovered (perhaps if you watch it more than 10 times, as I did). The\nmovie in general I think is awesome, the action sequences and the humor\nthat is, absolutely awesome. RIP Paul ... You will be missed, you did\nachieve a lot, inspired many!\n...............................................................\n"},
{"review": "\nI really love this movie. It's so good. It's probably my favorite Fast\nAnd Furious movie. I love that it's not just driving cars, they're\ngoing to steal money. Awesome. This movie has a great cast and great\nsoundtrack.<br><br>In this movie, Dom and Brian have created a plan. Them, along with\ntheir new crew, get together to do a massive heist. But, the thing is,\nthe vault that they want to steal from, belongs to one of the biggest\ncrime lords in Rio. And when they try to steal it, the crime lord puts\nhis safe in the police station, since he's bought off every cop in the\ncity. So, now the group must work out a way to steal a vault from a\npolice station. Easy right? Not really. But in the end their amazing\nplan works out and they get heaps of money.<br><br>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.\n"},
{"review": "\nLOVED this movie. My favorite of the whole franchise(not counting the\nseventh one as that's not in theaters yet).<br><br>But I warn you- if you're one of those movie goers who wants everything\nto be a thousand percent believable this movie is not for you. There\nare some stunts that could be perceived as a bit far fetched, but I\nstill loved it- I mean, I go to the movies to get away from reality for\na couple hours, so whether it's a rom-com where the guy gets the girl\nevery time no matter how much he messes up, or some unrealistic stunts\nin a drama/action, I don't care if it technically can't happen the way\nthey do it on screen. It's entertainment to me, and this movie is VERY\nentertaining to me.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had always loves the series and enjoyed all of them.This one ships\nwith usual clich\u00e9 and storyline.The chases are hair raising,dialogs are\nsolid,and there are plenty of funny lines.All of this makes fast five a\nmust watch although suspension of belief if always there in Hollywood\nentertainment movies.This film follows a tight script with lots of\ntwists and turns although all of them may not surprise you.Plot is\nreally convincing and carried forward by amazing cinematography and\nediting.Director cleverly choose between amazing camera angles,which\neditor had turned into a edge of the seat scenes. This film never\nmisses the beat even when there are short emotional moments in the\nmovie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm not a movie critic. I know what I like. And this movie is, without\na doubt, very well done. The action is top shelf, the pace is fast and\nunrelenting, the cars and women are stunning and there isn't a single\ncharacter, even the villain, who is truly despicable. That is, everyone\nin the movie is likable and watchable.<br><br>It was great to see Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) playing somewhat of a bad\nguy but he's also one of the good guys. Being a fan of Clear and\nPresent Danger, I was a little disappointed that Joaquim de Almeida's\nrole wasn't more prominent but it is, essentially, an ensemble cast\nthat is fun to watch. Definitely a movie worth watching and there isn't\nmuch of a lull anywhere in the movie to allow for a quick run to the\nbathroom so make sure you're familiar with the pause button's location\non your remote.\n"},
{"review": "\nGreat movie! I was bored and wanted some real surround noise :) so I\nplayed it! Wow! Somewhere between Tropa de Elite and Fast and furious!\nSo, Fast and furious on steroids!

Nothing is out place or time.\nJust set back and be prepared for a big smile through out the movie! I\nreally had big smile at the end. True enjoyment.<br><br>SPOILER: At the end of the movie (after ending slides already start),\none small scene brought back dead to life (Letty)! So, watch it until\nall of it passes.

{"review": "\nGood Movie. Great story line. However i was very disappointed in the\nlack of street racing and Japanese street cars. When they won all of\nthe cars they should have shown how some of the races when they won\nthem. There was great action scenes and everything besides the lack of\nstreet racing was good. 2 fast 2 furious had a pretty good amount of\nstreet racing making it my second favorite fast and furious, but Tokyo\ndrift was by far my favorite, it had plenty of street racing car\ndriving and drifting, i loved it. Please put more street Racing in next\nmovie, make it more like Tokyo drift please, this one seems to be\nmissing the old fast and furious trademark (the driving, street racing\netc.) and make sure to include Japanese street cars such as Skylines,\nEvo's, supra's, 350Z etc. Oh and please make sure Paul Walker is in it.\nThanks.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis is the best film in the series, probably because it borrowed\nheavily from the recent version of The Italian Job. It borrowed ideas\nsuch as deciding to use a fast, nimble car to navigate through a narrow\nparking garage, creating a copy of the target location in which to\npractice, obtaining the same safe they will need to crack later, and\nusing street cameras to direct cars through traffic. All of these\nelements were used in The Italian Job. Oddly enough, rumors had it that\na sequel to The Italian Job was going to be made and be set in Brazil\nbut it was never made. Was this supposed to be that sequel? Probably\nnot. A sequel would've had new ideas and this one just had a rehash of\nold ones.<br><br>Anyway, despite similarities to The Italian Job, this film was\nentertaining and enjoyable to watch.\n"},

{"review": "\nOK I wont bitch around here, even though I am not really into\nunrealistic movies this ain't the reason I didn't like it that much.\nYou could probably imagine that they are in the matrix and well this is\nwhy they are able to survive every car crash, every jump from a 1000\nfoot and can dodge every each one of the 10.000000 bullet which are\nfired at them. But what really bothered me was the lack of creativity\n(hah, that rhymed), that makes us all fortunetellers. In this movie\nnothing unsuspected happens which you would probably expect from a\nmovie like this. However the action was actually great. So for all you\nadrenaline junkies out there Fast Five is waiting' for you!\n"},
{"review": "\nThere is more story here than in the previous instalments. Combine that\nwith an exotic setting in Rio and a stunning car chase climax it's well\nworth watching. Not just about car chases anymore. There is a daring\nbreak in. The Rock provides quite a good addition. His scenes with Vin\nDiesel is quite memorable. <br><br>Couple of minus points: the way they portrayed parts of Rio as a gun\ninfested slum must not be the image Rio is hoping to promote for the\n2016. There could have been more attractive settings. Bit too sexist\nuse of the ladies too. <br><br>Overall enjoyable and a bit more far ranging than the last few.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt was loud. It was fast. Cars raced and crashed. They shot people.\nPeople fell in love.<br><br>Every man in this movie is so sexy I could hardly breathe. Don't worry\nfellas, there's lot of eye candy for you too.<br><br>Plot? What plot. There's kind of a plot but who gives a damn. Let's be\nloud, fast, race cars, crash them and ratchet up the tension with an\nimpossible heist for tons of money involving murderous drug dealers\n(Long live Bucho! still got mad swag after all these years) and corrupt\ncops.<br><br>It even had an \"after the credits twist\" that left my eyes stinging\nwith surprised tears.<br><br>I love this movie!\n"},
{"review": "\nI watched the movie today, apart for some childish action and\ndestroying of entire Mexico's capital with just 2 cars and 9 guys it\nmakes one think that is Mexico a pathetic country where entire police\nforce is unable to stop a single money heist? Tugging of a container\nwith two cars and rampage the entire city is too much fantasy that\nanyone can laugh about it and say Mexican's please wake up and do\nsomething about your country otherwise you will be perished in this\nworld. Reviews should be logical and not that it s a good movie or a\nbad one. Mr Vin Diesel is just pulling up the legacy of first movie.\nFor a teenager it might be a good movie but after watching thousands of\nmovies this looks quite sub standard and useless activity to watch a\nmovie and waste money and time, where there are good movies that can be\nviewed.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis should be categorised as super science fiction, but I'll let that\nslide.. Just stuff your brain in your pocket for this one and enjoy the\nride.<br><br>The action is way over the top unbelievable, as is the preposterous\nstory line, as well as every sentence of dialogue. It's also a little\ntoo long for its own good. But overall, you won't really care. This is\nthe 5th instalment of a franchise where you know what to expect - a lot\nof car action as well as plenty of gun-toting, foot chasing and\none-on-one brawling; on which it delivers, overwhelmingly so, to the\npoint that your head will be spinning by the end of it all.\n"},
{"review": "\nAfter I have read all the positive international reviews I thought this\nmust be a real action movie and above all the best one of this\nfranchise. But I was wrong because in my opinion there were only three\ngreat respectable scenes with full of adrenaline. The remaining story\nwas too long. The running time could have been reduced at maximal 95\nminutes. There were dialogs where I felt nearly asleep. The characters\nand actors didn't convince me. Then I missed a fresh and intelligent\nstory with intriguing, mysterious or adventure elements to take me\ndefinitely on a great ride in Rio. The story is so simply sticked as in\nThe Expendables or Swordfish. That's why this movie is far away from\nblockbusters such as DIE HARD, TERMINATOR, JAMES BOND or THE BOURNE\nIDENTITY series. I am so disappointed and I won't give another chance\nin future. Too overrated on IMDb. My vote is slow five out of ten.\n"},
{"review": "\nI must ask was Vin Diesel on some kind of drugs while he was filming\nthis? Seriously, every time he appeared on screen he looked like he\ncould use a nap. Maybe he realized how bad this is and did not want to\ngive an effort.<br><br>I enjoyed 1 and 2nd FnF and did not watch rest of them except this last\none.<br><br>Except for few funny scenes and Dwayne Johnson rest is plain crap.\nNothing is consistent. Pretty much like Transformers 3. You simply jump\nfrom one scene in no particular order and that is annoyance.<br><br>Supporting cast is completely obnoxious and that was not easy to\nachieve.<br><br>Don't bother to watch as I can not with describing how bad it is any\nlonger.\n"},
{"review": "\nFF5 is a real thrill a minute ride - and given that it's over 2 hours\nlong - it never flags or loses it's way for a moment. There's less\nracing and more action in this one and it could well be the best of the\nseries - intelligent, fun, exciting, and even some heart, this really\ndoes have it all - and it a great guys' popcorn movie.<br><br>The action takes place in Rio - and after corrupt cops and the FBI all\nstart chasing our heroes they decide to go for one last big score both\nfor the money and revenge.<br><br>Honestly, this is entertaining action, and an absolute knock-out of a\nmovie - don't let the fact that this is the 5th installment fool you -\nthis is full-blown with a real budget and action stars - all in all a\ntruly entertaining movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI went with a certain amount of trepidation, but I came out of this\nmovie impressed with action. Sure, the plot is below average and the\ndialogue is laughable but I really didn't expect either to be good. The\nrefreshing thing is that there is real dialogue, forced but real and\nthey punched up the fun all the way through. Bottom line - see this\nbecause it is a fun action movie with enough cars and fun to make the\npopcorn go down easy. It may not keep you on the edge of your seat but\nit doesn't have to for the most part.<br><br>If you see this with the kind of low expectations that I had (heck,\neven if you're greatly anticipating this thing), I'm willing to bet\n(since I bet on everything) that you'll enjoy it.\n"},
{"review": "\nOnly watching four movies a year at the theaters now, I went to see\nthis movie out of my vestigial interest in fast cars left over after\nyears of owning sports cars and fast cars...<br><br>The plot line is pretty much just an excuse for insane chase scenes\nthat defy the laws of physics and just all the other laws out there.<br><br>The target audience will enjoy the movie, but this movie did not really\nbring anything new to the table as far as the cars, it brings in cast\nmembers from the previous sequels and does'nt even try to explain the\nconnections. <br><br>Besides these little quibbles, I have never seen a movie where they\nused so little actual real natives. They only used Rio as a backdrop\nand huge set, clearing the streets almost completely for all the\nscenes. <br><br>But now that I think about it, that was the way all of the movies have\nbeen made.

{"review": "\nI went to see this film with my boyfriend and i thought as its a lads\nfilm, i wouldn't like it but i really did. It was very fun to watch and\nhad some good car chases in it.

This film is aimed for the male audience but that doesn't make\nit any less enjoyable for a female as i liked it.<br><br>There is a few cheesy lines but they are funny. There was always\nsomething going on and this film definitely keeps your attention. I\nliked the ending, it was a positive conclusion for Dom and the rest of\nhis friends.<br><br>This was very entertaining and well worth a watch. I would defo watch\nthis again on DVD.

{"review": "\nWaatching the previous F&amp;F movies !i Thought this movie dint live up to\nexpectation. They tried to get all the old stars but many of them look\nquite old.

Especially,\nloved it when the truck right in between the road to surprise its true\nreason for being on roads. Sure is worth a watch. Among all the\nprevious F&amp;F movies, i guess the \"Tokyo Drift\" is the best of movies I\nhave ever watched. Find it really hard for any of the movies to come\nclose to that. I guess the next part of the movie they should pick up\nsome of the latest model and told something about the latest car. In\nfact, they should bring in those Aston Martins, Bugatis, Formula-1\ncars, allthose re completely missing.

{"review": "\nI watched the movie few days ago and I enjoyed it very much. The\nstoryline, casting, directing and more specially the team of stars in\nthe previous fasts. In fact, all stars in the previous parts play their\nrole in this part (sometime very short) and gathering such a group of\nactors in a sequel is unique after \"Godfather 3\".<br><br>The story is a little different with previous parts and this time, the\nmovie is more similar to movies like \"Italian job\". However the\nstoryline is really interesting and it causes you forget the time. I\ngive 9 because I think that some part of the movie is not very logical\n(like stealing the police cars scene).<br><br>Generally I suggest the movie to every racing movies lover and moreover\naction movies.\n"},

{"review": "\nThe Fast and the Furious was Oh My God! FnF: New Model Original Parts\nwas AMAZIN. If this is true with you, get set for a more pumpin\nadrenaline session.

{"review": "\nFor those of us who watched all of the Fast and the Furious series,\nsimply the thought of having most of the main characters from the past\neditions in one movie is a valid reason to pay. The result is just what\nwe expect of a Fast and Furious: stunts, rides and babes. The\natmosphere of Rio is a refreshing alternative to American centered\nfilming. However, ultimately, the film goes over the top. By telling\nthe story through the view of the (not that) good guys, the bad guys,\nand, also, a third perspective, that of a team of elite FBI agents led\nby \"The Rock\", time worthy of boiling oil and pumping adrenaline is\nlost. Instead, we get more of the sit-at-home work-out-plan kind of\nscenes that are often unnecessary. Nevertheless, a true fan of cars and\naction will find Fast Five very enjoyable.\n"},
{"review": "\nExcellent movie with as expected Great Hip Hop Music. The movie was\npretty much up to the mark.

GReat Idea...!\n"},
{"review": "\nGreat movie but didn't close up to the expectations. As usual the base\ncast was great. Vin Diesel was awesome as expected. The rock was\nrocking in the movie, his character matched his true personality. As in\nthe previous movies stunts performed were mind boggling and full of\nthrill, can't wait do do them myself. Cool and solid cars as in\nprevious movies. Chicks wearing bikinis and riding hot bikes. Has some\nirrelevant superman fighting sequences but what about it every movie\nneeds it. Good casting everyone fits well in their characters. Full of\nawesome stunts from the start to the end. One can never fall asleep\nwhile watching such a movie. The heist plot is very difficult to\npredict till the end which keeps your mind on the movie and not on the\nchick on the next seat. Full of thrills and twists. Not the best of\nFast And Furious, seen better but still a must watch as the previous\nflicks...\n"},
{"review": "\nthis is best one of the franchise, the action is just in your face. I\nonly saw the first two Fast and the Furious sequels. I didn't see the\n3rd or the 4th.

The\naction is ten times intense then ever, it has awesome chase scenes.

If you are being payed to do\nsomething, you aren't going to stop midway through and say: you wanted\nthis? well obviously if you wanted it i should steal it from you.\nStupid, stupid plot. Absolute fail. Stop making movies. Besides that\nthere are cool looking cars and girls in skimpy outfits, so if thats\nyour thing, go for it.
