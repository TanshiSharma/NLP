{"review": "\nMost on this site pick the Godfather, or the Shawshank Redemption, but\nthis is it, this is the best film ever made. People will complain, will\nargue that I am wrong, but I will say it again...Braveheart is as close\nto perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man who\nplayed Lonshanks, the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce, both should\nhave been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil\nand a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) by\nmeeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction, the\ncinematography. Braveheart is glorious, beautiful to look at. The slow\nmotion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants, the\nentire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera.\nBraveheart is artwork, it is as good as any picture. That the film is\nnumber 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes there\nis violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that\nfreedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible,\nto let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a\ngreat movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's\nlist of greatest films.\n"},
{"review": "\nI remember seeing this movie for the first time in late 2003, and I was\nimpressed. I saw it again last night, and I was even more impressed.\nThe acting is amazing, and the ending was brilliant. For me, all my\nguesses were incorrect. Everything that happens in this movie in\nunpredicted. The last half hour itself was highly unpredictable, and it\nhad a powerful message. When a scene was meant to be dramatic, they did\na great job at it. I don't know about everybody else, but the ending\ndid make me cry. The message the movie sent kept me thinking for a\nwhile. The amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable, there was\nbarely any faults or anything wrong with the movie. For a movie of\n1995, they did a great job.<br><br>I absolutely guarantee this movie to anybody who enjoys action and war\nwith a bit of drama mixed in. One of the best, or maybe even the best\nmovie of the 20th century.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nOn my list of the greatest movies of all time, BraveHeart ranks as number\n3.\nIt is by far one of the most epic stories ever told.  Mel Gibson deserved\nall the credit he recieved and more. His portrayal of William Wallace, one\nof Scotlands most mightiest warriors, was spot on.  The only part that\nlacked was the romantic affair of Princess Isabella and Wallace.  It\nhistorically never happened.  This movie also has other historical errors\nbut WHO CARES!<br><br>The Battle of Stirling has to be the second most graphic piece of footage\never shot next to Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. I love the part where\nthe English Commander gives the order to charge and Wallace sees this and\nraises his broadsword into the air and starts yelling.  He charges the\nfield\nwith the Scots and I'll let you see the movie to see what happens\nnext.<br><br>Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational\nand I think that the REAL William Wallace would be proud of the way Mel\nGibson portrayed him.<br><br>My hat goes off to Mel Gibson.  I hope he makes a few more movies like this\none.<br><br>Out of ten............10/10!\n\n"},

Any normal audience would likely to cast his/her sense of\nreality away and be captivated by this distant Celtic saga. <br><br>Beside proving himself as a brilliant director, Mel Gibson more\nimportantly gave life to a historical hero whose superb gallantry,\nvivid character and magnificent spirit shall never be history.

After\nseeing the death of his wife at the hands of an English nobleman,\nWilliam Wallace (Mel Gibson) sets out on a quest for vengeance that\nquickly turns into a crusade for freedom for the entire \"country\".

{"review": "\nI saw this film for the first time on cable, and, fortunately, it was\nan \"uncut\" version. I was greatly impacted, but, as bad luck would have\nit, I would not see it again for two years.<br><br>Mel Gibson is an accomplished actor, with films like \"Mad Max\" and\n\"Lethal Weapon\" under his belt. \"Ransom\" showed he was more than just a\nquirky role actor, but it was \"Braveheart\" that proved to everyone that\nhe was a great actor... and director.<br><br>What he has envisioned and ensnared on camera is one of the great\ncinematic achievements of all time, and at an awkward time, too.\nLooking back at previous years at the Oscars, and you have \"Schindler's\nList,\" \"Dances with Wolves,\" and \"Unforgiven.\" Looking ahead, you have\n\"Titanic,\" \"Shakespeare in Love,\" and \"Gladiator.\" These are all period\npieces. Right smack dab in the middle is \"Braveheart.\" It is the most\nsimple of the films above, yet it is arguably the best. None will argue\nits impact is greater than \"Schindler's List\" nor its power greater\nthan \"Unforgiven,\" but what it has, more than any of those other films,\nis heart. Much like his \"Passion of the Christ,\" Mel Gibson brings a\npassion to this film, and that is what sustains it.<br><br>Mel Gibson plays William Wallace, a well-educated Scottish peasant who\nis determined to lead a peaceful life. Well, if you've seen the poster\nfor this film, you probably already know that he doesn't succeed. When\na law is put into place that says English noblemen have first right to\nlay with Scottish brides, Wallace marries in secret. But, when it is\nfound out, a local noble attempts to take Murron, Wallace's wife, she\nresists, leading to a gruesome execution. With little choice, Wallace\nopts for vengeance, and thus begins the journey of Scotland's greatest\nwarrior.<br><br>This is a wonderfully acted, directed, photographed, and designed film\nwith great performances, particularly from a breathtakingly beautiful\nSophie Marceau, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.\n"},

{"review": "\nUnfortunately, I have yet to find a film of quite this caliber again.\nBraveheart contains elements of Romance (several heart- wrenching and\nwarming instances), Epic/Action (spectacular scenes), Mystery (can take\na few viewings to put it all together), History (albeit romanticised)\nand of course Drama (perfectly unravelled). This level of uncompromised\nmulti-tasking allows the film to move you to laugh and cry, love and\nhate or even to think and be taught. I'm trying to avoid the clich\u00e9s of\nglowing reviews (almost as bad as entirely negative ones) - but this is\none of the few movies that I feel deserves one.<br><br>The witty banter between friends/foes/lovers/relatives is, in my\nopinion, flawless and aids the film's claim as a true classic. The\nsoundtrack is similarly top-notch and encapsulates and refracts the\npatriotic theme during several key moments. The political sub-plot and\ngorgeous scenery also serve as refreshers during otherwise heavy areas\nof the story. Perhaps Braveheart's only flaw (but if you share my\nsentiments it's actually a bonus) is its length so you'll want to\nprepare a comfy seat and maybe even two pots of tea (complete with\ncosies!).<br><br>I suppose it's also relevant to touch on the historic inaccuracies as I\nexpect this is what people might dislike most about this film. However,\n\"History is written by those who have hanged heroes\"; also, the overall\nsketchiness of such periods coupled with the right of artistic license\nare enough for me to personally dismiss such thoughts. On that note, I\nhope you also enjoy what, to me, is the greatest film created (so far).\n"},

{"review": "\nFighting for freedom an't always go the peaceful Gandhi way. In order\nfor true freedom in brutal times to come as peaceful as possible,\nrevenge was essential.

Violence, corruption, rape, and rule\nwere all used to take complete advantage over the Scottish until\nWallace started a powerful rebellion to become a war hero and lead the\nScottish to fight against the English in order to restore freedom and\npeace. William Wallce's incredible story is shown through the eyes of\ndirector Mel Gibson. Gibson envisioned the history of the tension\nbetween the two United Kingdom provinces beautifully, as he captures\ngroundbreaking film-making to portray a biography and historical film\nlike no other film has ever gone. Every shot is so intriguing and\nrelevant to the story. The film-making aspects such as cinematography,\nsetting, costumes, and editing are superbly made to make the history\ncome to life. The filming of the Scottish highlands is magnificent and\nbeautiful and really gets a feel of what warfare in the 12th century\nlooked like. Historical films can often be dragged out and too\nbiographical to tell a story as if it came from a history book. Writer\nRandall Wallace gives great background that is timed perfectly and\ndeveloped the struggles and inspirations for William Wallace that\nleaves Mel Gibson to direct and portray William Wallace beautifully. He\nnails the Scottish accent! As for themes, freedom is a virtue that is a\ngift! Freedom is something that is a privileged to have and should be\nfought for if needed. Gibson and Wallace also get the message of\nfighting for anything. Not violently like William Wallace had to, but\nfighting in any way in order for good outcomes to be released.

And why\ndemean the hero by having him up against such a pantomime villain - sure\nEdward was a twisted b*****d, but the filmmakers might as well have given\nhim a sidekick called Igor and have him cackle at choice moments\nthroughout\nthe film, he was that unsubtle.\nMost importantly, however, it seems a real shame that it should be this\nfilm\nthat should have captured the hearts of the Scottish nation, they deserve\nso\nmuch better. Would you believe there is now a hideous statue of Mel Gibson\nat the foot of the Wallace Memorial in Stirling? Would you believe people\nare leaving flowers beneath it?\nThis film is a travesty of both a good story and history itself. Scotland\ndeserves so much better.\n"},

{"review": "\nBraveheart (1995): Dir: Mel Gibson / Cast: Mel Gibson, Sophie Marceau,\nPatrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack, Angus Macfadyen: Here is a\nsalute to freedom and the price paid.

Mel Gibson presents impressive battle sequences as Wallace\naligns with other villages in an attempt to form an army to overthrow\nKing Edward 1 of England. Gibson portrays Wallace as a man bent on\nfreedom to the point of death, and he is faced with many victories as\nwell as betrayals. When he yells out the word, \"freedom\", he does so\nduring his darkest moment. Sophie Marceau plays the Princess to the\nKing's young feeble Prince. She is sent as a form of information and\ndecoy but she becomes enamored with Wallace and warns him of danger.\nPatrick McGoohan as King Edward 1 is a thunderous villain ruler bent on\nconquering opposition until he lay on his death bed with words\nwhispered into his conscience that embed worse than his greatest\ndefeat.

{"review": "\nTo be fair, viewed as a cinematic project, this was good with very\nrealistic battle scenes and overall landscape. However, from a\nhistorical point of view, it is utter tripe. On 25 January 1308, Edward\nII married Isabella of France, yet the movie purports to have Wallace\nimpregnate the princess of Wales at some point before he died while she\nis married to Edward II. Yet the 'fact' is, Wallace was executed three\nyears before the Princess was even married. Given that the princess\ndidn't give birth until 1312, that must have been one heck of a\ngestation period, 7 years to be exact. Also, at the battle of Stirling,\nor more accurately 'The Battle of Stirling Bridge', Wallace did not\ndefeat heavy chivalry using lines of disciplined troops carrying long\nstave's. He defeated the English because the English were forced to\ncross a narrow bridge, and once penned in, they were easier to kill.\nThis was compounded by the rout into the cavalry and the collapse of\nthe bridge leading to many troops drowning. Wallace was a guerrilla\nfighter, not a strategist. This might have been a great movie if Mel\nGibson had kept to the truth, as it is, it is a seriously marred piece\nof sensationalist anti-English hokum that would be more at home as a\nwork of fiction that one supposedly based on fact.\n"},

A young man yearning to be a warrior while being forced to\nbecome a politician.  Also veteran British actor Patrick McGoohan is a joy\nto watch as King Edward the Longshanks.

{"review": "\nThe film may have a memorable quote. It may have a well known actor.\nBut that in my mind does not redeem this film.

It badly alters history, exaggerating what\nthe British did. The myth of Primae Noctis was established by this\nfilm. The chronology is quite poor, Isabella was nine when Wallace died\nand Edward III was born seven years later. William Wallace committed\nsome atrocities in his fight for 'Freedom' and raided England. You\ncould make a good film out of this by showing the moral dubiousness of\nhis actions, but instead a quite one-sided portrayal is given. Not only\ndoes it install bad ideas but it increases a quite negative stereotype\nof the British. Not all Americans think like this, but such films\nreinforce the stereotype of them thinking in such basic terms.

When a British soldier notices his wife and\nattempts to rape her, Wallace comes in and saves her causing a riot in\ntheir village and he thinks he's got her safe when he sends her away\nfrom the soldiers, but they catch her and kill her right in front of\nher family.\n"},
{"review": "\n\n\tA remarkable film in which I can watch several times without faltering.  I\nam as much a lover of history as I am of film and literature, so I must\nacknowledge that this film is loosely based on the life of Wallace and does\nfall short in numerous instances to historical verity.  That said it remains\na stunning achievement in film work liberally reconstructions actual events\nin order to present a gripping modern epic.<br><br>\tThe entire movie is engaging but two scenes stand out: The `gift of the\nthistle' moment when the beautiful young Murron presents the young Wallace\nwith a wildflower at his father's funeral.  Few tableaus in film history can\nmatch the power here as the music swells in harmony with touching scene. \nThe tremendous Stirling battle scene (though vastly historically inaccurate)\nis also a piece de resistance, from Wallace's rousing speech to his contempt\nfor the English commander, from the comic relief of the mooning and flashing\nof the recalcitrant Scots and finally the riveting battle itself (that may\nonly possibly be rivaled by Saving Private Ryan's D-Day landing sequence for\nsheer power in a battle scene).  It's also notable that the script and\nGibson's direction provide for a juxtaposition of this violence with the\nsoothing powers of femininity; the bride who eases her husband's wrath sotto\nvoce and gently pushes the adversaries blade from his throat, the lure of a\nlife with Murron in which Wallace initially attempts to stay clear of war\nand the obvious benevolence of the princess.<br><br>\tThis movie is a great one and without a doubt in my top\nten.<br><br>\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWhat can I say about this movie. This is one of the best movie out there. I\nliked everything about it. The scenery was beautiful. The battle scenes were\nreally well done, bloody, but well done. the music is really good. This\nmovie gave me goose bumps. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good\nbattle movie, or a good drama. \n"},
{"review": "\n\nI can't even express how much this film means to me. My husband and I even\nused parts in our wedding. Never has a film moved me this much. No, it's\nnot\nhistorically accurate, so little was known of the real William Wallace. It\nwas\nperhaps over the top in parts. It had brutal war scenes. No one can\ndispute\nthat this film is an epic, sweeping wonderful story. Also, James Horner\nwrote a stunning score. Truly a classic, energising, and beautiful\nstory.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt is simply wrong to pervert history in the way this film does.\nReading the reviews, the many American reviewers seem to believe it as\nan accurate representation. It isn't. It takes more liberties that a\nWalter Scott novel The acting is also very mixed. The Irish accent of\nthe actor playing the father of Wallace shines through for instance,\nand Gibson's attempt as a Scottish accent is almost on a par with Dick\nvan Dyke in Mary Poppins. Beautifully filmed with some fine\nperformances (eg Brian Cox) it also has a haunting score, and it has\nentered movie history with so many of its effects and sayings entering\npopular culture, like Scots sports fans painting their faces blue. But\nit is tosh. Hardly any of it happened, the time line is way out and\nGibson is far to short to play Wallace who was a giant of a man. For\nme, the reaction of Americans who constantly seek imaginary roots only\ngoes to prove that as a nation they are on the dimmer side of average.\nEnjoy the film as a fairy tale but just remember it is a fairy tale.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film by Gibson is very imaginative, but should never be\ninterpreted as being historically accurate. Personally, I disliked the\ngraphic violence, the awful details of guts being ripped out, etc., but\nthis degree of violence seems to be the norm for Gibson - he seems to\nthink it adds realism or impact. When he has the Scottish rebel\nseducing the English queen - well, I'm an Aussie Republican, too, but\ndo we have to resort to this level of dishonesty to make an impression?\nI think it was a great pity the account did not stay closer to the\nfacts; that would have been sufficient because the ancient truths of\nthe era were impressive enough.\n"},

{"review": "\n...hands down. I don't understand why this movie does not have a higher\nranking of Greatest Movies of All Time. It should be Number 1. Everyone\nI know whom I respect as a human being LOVES this movie because of its\nthemes of courage, honor, love, faith, and sacrifice. <br><br>The cinematography, acting, script, music, themes were all absolutely\nbrilliant. I registered for an IMDb account just to make this review\nand in honor of James Horner (RIP). I have seen this movie about 50\ntimes (not kidding) and heard the soundtrack 100x+ (again, not\nkidding). <br><br>Mel Gibson created a timeless masterpiece. And James Horner composed\nit.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is one of the best History movie. This about a war between\nScotland and the Birth empire. Mel Gibson did a great job. This movie\nhas a great story line. It also had great acting. It also has get\nspecial effects. It very fast pass. It has a lot of action. This is a\ngreat movie. See it. People who say it is historically inaccurate do\nnot know what they are taking about. They probably just have some hate\non for Mel Gibson. You like history see this movie. This one of the\nbest history movies ever. It is not a family friendly movie. Which is\ngood thing because I hate family friendly movie. I think they suck. I\nhave not seen a lot of history movie I just got into them. This is one\nthe best one I have seen so far.\n"},
{"review": "\nBRAVEHEART is one of the greatest inspiration I've had as a filmmaker.\nIt inspires excellence in the film craft, both in terms of its\nexcellent production quality from the crew and the beautiful\nperformance by the cast of the movie. The fact that the movie is based\non true events inspires me even more. For me, Brave Heart is the\ngreatest patriotic movies of all times. I never get tired of watching\nit, and every time I watch it I'm doubly inspired; first it makes me\nreaffirm my decision to live my life a dedicated patriot of my country,\nand secondly to dedicate myself as a filmmaker to producing movies that\nwill impact positively on humanity. I love the great plot of the story,\nthe amazing epic setting, and my most thrilling of all; the perfectly\nchoreographed BATTLE OF STERLIN BRIDGE. It has also inspired a couple\nof my works as a filmmaker. It's a must watch for every filmmaker!\n"}
