{"review": "\nI LOVED the first installment of this series (more than the second) and\nmost beautiful part about the two parts is the love story. It was a\nSHOCK that they had to kill the character of Gwen Stacy specially when\nit is Emma Stone playing it. It left me in a sad sad feeling. <br><br>Another thing I could not digest was how EASILY Peter Parker moved on\nfrom her after her death (I Know the inspiration came from her own\nspeech, but if it were myself, I could never move on). I was expecting\nto be shown as the spiderman officially retired, for the next\ninstallment to have even more vicious villain forcing him to return.\n(Kinda like The Dark Knight Rises)<br><br>I mean leaving all this aside, I LOVED it!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis could be the movie of the year for me definitely this movie is so\namazing and so good I think a stupid rating 7.4 is so low it should\nhave been beyond 8 but I rate it high mostly because of visual\neffects,Andrew Garfield+Emma Stone,Dane DeHaan's amazing play and the\nsadness in the end.<br><br>This movie is funny is sad is amazing in every aspect. A.Garfield\ntopped this movie no doubt the best Spider-Man movie ever and until now\none of the best movies of this year it just couldn't be better. From\nwhat I watched this year this movie is far better than any one else\nexcept I am waiting to see Dawn of the Planes of the Apes to see if is\nany better but until now this one is the best one yet,\n"},
{"review": "\nin my opinion Electro is one of the coolest spider-man villains, his\ndesigned looked epic and so were his powers and Jamie Foxx was very\ngood playing him. Also his soundtrack was very good and added to the\nwhole powerful feel of electro. The acting in this film was very good\nand believable and so was the romance between Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone)\nand Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield). The storyline was very interesting\nand there was the right number of villains in the film, however i do\nbelieve that the goblin was shoved in at the end just to kill Gwen, and\nthe Rhino just to set up other films. So therefore i think Harry Osborn\nshould have had more screen time as the goblin. Furthermore, it would\nhave been better if the whole thing with spider-man quitting after\nGwen's death should have continued until the end of the film and the\nnext film should have started with spider-man returning and fighting\nthe rhino. More reasons why i was disappointed are that Norman Osborn\ngot about 4 minutes screen time and a lot of the movie was wasted on a\nstupid, boring sub story about Peter trying to find out about his dad\nwhich lead to one moment that was relevant to the plot ; the bit about\nthe spider venom. However as i have previously mentioned, these\ndisappointing and frustrating things were partly made up for by\nelectro. I enjoyed every elector scene and they were all exhilarating.\nSo overall a very good film with a few flaws here and it set up future\nfilms very well, which I'm am very much looking forward to.\n"},
{"review": "\nI loved the original spider-mans but I really do prefer Andrew Garfield\nas the main man, he plays the character a lot better than Tobey\nMaguire. First things first this film was great, plenty of action,\nromance and drama. The CGI was fantastic and what they did to Jamie\nFoxx's character Electro was amazing it was like he was a complete\ndifferent person! You learn a little more on peters parents and were\nintroduced to Harry Osbourne Aka Peters best friend (well in the\noriginals he was) this was a great marvel film made and I will always\nwatch the new spider man films until they stop making them because\nthey're brilliant.<br><br>SPOILER ALERT! The only thing I was disappointed with in this film was\nthat Gwen Stacey dies *sobs* I heard that she was going to be killed\noff but I wasn't sure that it would be in this movie. I did actually\ncry a little because I loved her character and the chemistry between\nher and Peter (The real life couple) was spot on. I really wished they\nhadn't of killed her off because Emma stone played that character so\ngood now we have to see peter fall in love all over again with Mary\nJane (that's if they bring that character into the third movie) but all\nin all this film was a 10/10\n"},
{"review": "\nOK years after the not really amazing Spider-Man this new series of\nspidey movies has not been successful with adults and some teens. But\nnow the 2nd movie was 1 year ago and it's been a very good film indeed.\nBut I don't really like the fact that there is going to be 2 MORE\nMOVIES!! So there is amazing Spider-Man 3 coming 2016 and amazing\nSpider- Man 4 in 2018. But let us talk about amazing Spider-Man 2 and\nthe Spider-Man 2 in 2004 so we can compare it to each other. First of\ncourse amazing Spider-Man 2 so it has got over the top action lots of\nswinging moments of course and 3 villains which are the green goblin\nelectro and the 2 minute rhino!! Over to Spider-Man 2 it has got some\nrubbery moments and only 1 villain doc ock and also boring stuff so\namazing Spider-Man two Is a big improvement from amazing Spider-Man\n2012 and although it's sometimes silly it's really entertaining for\npeople everywhere but of course amazing Spider-Man 2012 is so silly and\nunneeded(SOZ mark Webb) so yeah\n"},
{"review": "\nNot too bad &amp; not too good ,that's what can I say for this movie. This\nmovie has a nice story line,and I think I just like the visual effect.\nI don't like Sad Ending, actually it's not Sad Ending it just not Happy\nEnding. I think people like this movie because this is a sequel, so the\npeople like this movie because they like the previously movie. And\nmaybe the people or \"The Watchers\" like this movie because they curious\nabout the new character. And what I want to know is, where is The\nElectro? well he just defeated from the battle with Spider Man and\nafter that he's gone. So... yeah this film is Not too Bad and Not too\nGood.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe first time I saw this movie (opening night) I was really\nunderwhelmed. Nothing in the movie seemed to make sense, because there\nwas so much in it. I went to a second viewing for the film and found\nmyself pleasantly surprised by how much I loved it. It is a really well\ndirected, written, and acted film. Many people hate on it because they\ncant follow it and find small things to complain about, but if you\nactually pay attention to the film, you see they explain things. a\ncommon complaint was \"why did Harry know to crawl to the goblin suit\nand know it would heal him\" wwell if you paid attention you will have\nseen he observed the suit in a earlier scene that explained everything\nabout it. So stop trying to find things to hate. This movie is\nfantastic and I believe it is the best Spider-Man film to date. And the\nbest incarnation of Spider-Man on film. The cast is really spectacular\nespecially Andrew Garfield and Dane DeHaan. So do yourselves a favor\nand ignore the critics. you'll have a blast. I love this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had high expectations for this picture due to two main reasons.\nFirst: I really loved the first Webb's vision on Spider-Man. Second:\nMany people told me good about it-- albeit some others said the\ncontrary. Anyways, I feel very sincere to say that it almost\ncorresponded to my hopes. The first hour of this film is extremely\nentertaining, containing lots of action, drama and even humor, each one\nin its own way. The scene in which our hero takes the pants off of a\ncriminal is really unexpected, reason why I instantly laughed. The\nrelationship between Peter Parker and Harry Osborn is just as great as\nI could've expected. They play that classic game in which initially\nthey seem to like each other, but, in some other times, they feel like\nenemies. Acting from Emma Stone is GREAT, like in the previous\ninstallment. Director has so much faith in her that basically all the\nemotive sentences come from her character-- which in fact touched me,\nmainly if considering I'm about to graduate. Besides, I feel very\nsatisfied that a Spider-Man movie FINALLY decided to explain the issue\ninvolving Peter's parents; I mean, for those-- like me-- who have never\nread the cartoons, their situation was an absolute abyss. Also, I\nenjoyed the joke involving \"Jaws\" and I had a spontaneous laugh in that\nscene. Photography directing and special effects are beautifully\nAWESOME. Other than that, I kind of agree with those who complained\nabout the plot, since it felt rushed for some moments, but it doesn't\nthe spoil the movie's overall qualities. \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\",\neven if not as great as the previous version, obviously, is a movie\nthat I respect and recommend to anyone who enjoys this superhero.\nThumbs up!\n"},
{"review": "\nAlthough i thought the film was great, i did feel the ending let it\ndown slightly. the death of Gwen ruined it for me. it made the fact of\nher going to oxford in england irrelevant. they gave you false hope of\nspider-man going to england and maybe continuing his adventure there.\nthe death of Gwen was a little to full on for my liking. following the\ndeath of Gwen makes the next spider-man film less exciting for me.<br><br>their relationship is a huge part to the spider-man films and now thats\ngone the films will never be the same. <br><br>apart from that i thought the acting was brilliant and spider-man/peter\nparker is played amazingly.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie presented the adventurous life of Peter Parker better known\nto us as Spiderman.Swinging between buildings, taking down criminals\nand saving the day, he is the hero every kid aspires to be. Though his\nlife seems so awesome, he faces his dilemma in his relationship with\nGwen Stacy. But his life takes a dark turn when his old friend Harry\nOsborn the sole heir of the Oscorp Industries returns back. Facing an\nincurable disease Harry requires the blood of the Spiderman, who could\nmutate the spider serum to cure Harry.Spiderman also faces Electro a\nnormal electrician who transforms after being bitten by mutated\nelectric eels having an inner grudge against Spiderman .Apart from his\npersonal relationship problems with Gwen and his guilt of not being\nable to help his best friend, Peter parker faces his past demons in\nunderstanding why his parents left him so suddenly without any\nexplanation.<br><br>The film has good CGI work with amazing 3D visuals.The storyline is\ngripping and fast paced keeping the audiences on the edge of their\nseats.Andrew Garfield brings life to the character of Peter Parker by\nportraying his eternal dilemmas and his difficulties living a double\nlife.Emma Stone is amazing as always in the role of Gwen Stacy,\nParker's love interest.The viewers though looking for action were also\nabsorbed in Peter's quest to find answers to his personal problems.The\nadrenaline filled, epic final fight sequences of Spiderman vs Electro\nand Green Goblin is one of the finest application of CGI and 3D effects\nmaking it a must go for all comic book and movie lovers. The fast paced\ncinematography and special effects made this one of the best movie of\nthe year winning a number of awards. Making its own mark in the\nsuperhero genre The Amazing Spiderman series may just give a strong\ncompetition to The Avengers series.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is amazing! Acting is very fabulous and character were well\nportrayed by all the actors. And I must say that the ending is awesome.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an enjoyable film for Spiderman's fan, or\njust someone who wants to see a fun and action movie. You will laugh,\nyou will get emotional, it has it all and at the right moment. The\nromance exceeds the action in the movie and it is a great blend of\naction and romance with comedy. The movie tells the story of\nSpiderman(Andrew Garfield) and Max(Jamie Foxx). Max is a person with\nfriends and nobody cares about him. He works at Oscorp(which is an\nelectricity generating company) as electrical engineer, which is also\nwhere Peter Parker's (Spiderman's) girlfriend Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone)\nworks. The CEO of Oscorp dies and Peter's old friend Harry Osborn(Dane\nDeHaan) who later on turn into Green Goblin becomes CEO of the Oscorp.\nHe finds out he has a disease which can only be cured by Spiderman's\nblood. Peter worries that using his blood may kill him. At the same\ntime, Max is involved in an accident, and turns him into Electro which\nis negative character in the movie. Max(Electro) wanted to be good\nperson and help the city but misunderstood himself due to his\nappearance. The first fight between Spiderman and Electro, which is a\nmemorable scene of the movie. To get the blood of Spiderman, Harry\nconvinced the Electro to come with him which is also turning part of\nthe movie. The design of Electro was not so good but green goblin was\nwell made. I recommend this film to anyone else looking for an action,\ncomedy and romantic film. To sum up, I think it is an overall excellent\nmovie and I give The Amazing Spiderman 2,Eight out of Ten.\n"},
{"review": "\nAs the title says, I thought this was a generally good movie, not Oscar\nquality, but entertaining. I walked out of this movie satisfied with\nall aspects of this movie except for one. <br><br>Throughout the movie max/electro is portrayed as a sympathetic villain\nthat you're supposed to feel bad for. We see his ideas stolen, his\naccident covered up, and then after the accident he is held and\nexperimented on. After all this, I felt genuinely bad for the\ncharacter, and was hoping for a Spider-Man 3-like ending in which the\nsympathetic villain is given redemption in the end (just to be clear I\nrecognize how terrible and ridiculous Spider-Man 3 was.) <br><br>However, in the end of this movie electro is killed without redemption,\nwhich, in my opinion made the whole \"sympathetic villain\" aspect of\nthis movie kinda redundant.<br><br>All that being said however, I did thoroughly enjoy this movie, and am\nlooking forward to future sequels. 9/10\n"},
{"review": "\nStrong movie, strong plot, excellent action, Andrew Garfield is an\namazing Peter Parker and a more amazing Spider-man with his jokes.\nStill, the villains' development is too much fast, with no persuasive\nreasons to take down the Spidey. Furthermore, my favorite scene it's\nthe one Peter fights Green Goblin on the tower, then try to saves Gwen\nby throwing the web, which in slow motion and forming a hand's shape\nwas completely amazing. Her death was sad, but epic, very well\ndeveloped and adequate. Also, the Rhino appearance in the end wasn't so\namazing, leaving curiosity for the next movie, and this is a fact that\nI don't like: the understanding that will have a next movie, even we\nknowing that will have.\n"},
{"review": "\nwell here it is the amazing spider man 2 sure I think they are too much\nspider man movies at least they are good and not bad and the actors\nwere good in this the best was harry Osbourne as he goes insane after\nhe discovers a family disease that killed his father and is after him\nand how could I forget Jamie Fox as the villain of the movie who spider\nman saves and names him then he becomes obsessed with spider man the\ngets in to an accident at work and becomes power after a fight that\nspider man wins he becomes depressed and abandoned and gets revenge on\nOscar meanwhile peter parker and Gwen Stacey and ends in tragedy all in\nall good\n"},

Oh man you guys are great!!!\nI'm the worst movie critique so accept the fact that I love this movie!\nI was so disappointed with the first one and at first, I didn't want to\nwatch the second movie either. But after watching this movie, my, I'm\nbreathless...Consider my mind blown away! First of all, I love Andrew\nGarfield. I could feel him in his scenes... His words, his actions, his\nfeelings. They were so intense! I love Emma Stone! Aside from being the\nperfect girl for Andrew, I have to say, you're a great actress, Emma!\nThis film is quite different from other action-adventure movies...I\nhate movies with a bad guy, sometimes supernatural, and then the good\nguy comes out, whooping saves the day. THE END (just like the first\namazing spider man movie) But the second movie? Wow. Took me off guard,\nactually. It's centered on a normal guy turned extraordinary. It's\ncentered on THE GUY! and his life, his family, his decisions. I love\nthat. I never knew that could be applied to adventure movies. Overall,\nit's a big thumbs up for me. I love how Spider man is so cool and chill\nall the time! And the bits of comedy, suspense? love it! Though I don't\nquite agree with Gwen dying in the end, because she's actually what\nkeeps Peter alive, I accept the fact that things don't always go your\nway in reality. It's just so tragic that Gwen died. I feel so sorry for\nPeter. They were both perfect. Okay so that's it! I love Andrew, Emma\nand the others! Matt Webb! Feel great guys, I appreciate you talented\npeople! You should never change, feel good but keep humility. Must\nwatch! Great film!\n"},

{"review": "\n\" . . . and washed this spider up.\" One pretty much expects Bond Girls\nto die. Every time Agent 007 gets hitched, his bride catches a bullet\nalmost before the wedding bouquet is tossed. But when a movie's heroes\nare perky high school kids, movie goers expect more longevity than that\nenjoyed by Bond Gals. It's depressing enough when teens turn out to\nhave their whole lives BEHIND them on Graduation Day in real life. Film\nescapism demands that trailers or previews must provide at least a\nkernel of truth-in-advertising. You expect teens to die in CARRIE,\nbecause the previews explicitly show that it's a horror flick. (Even\nHarry Potter's hapless \"Cedric Diggory\" character is a pretty minor\nplot sacrifice, thus no exception to this rule.) Teens are the number\none demographic for movie multiplexes, so responsible exhibitors should\nrefrain from biting the hand that feeds them. High schoolers also are\nthe most easily influenced film fans. Ever since the rash of suicides\nand suicides-by-cop inspired by the 1950s film REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE,\nHollywood studios have made an implicit pact with parents NOT to\nblindside them with another wolf in sheep's clothing like REBEL.\nHowever, AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 is in clear violation of this\nunderstanding. Therefore, it can be rated \"8\" for college kids, but\ndeserves a cautionary 4-out-of-10 for your impressionable high\nschoolers.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Amazing Spider Man 2 continues the story of the franchise, as Peter\nParker (Andrew Garfield) continues to be the iconic marvel hero.\nAlthough promising to tear his relationship apart with Gwen Stacy (Emma\nStone) to her father, Peter and her continues to see each other, as\nSpider Man keeps being the hero of New York City. Meanwhile, a new\nvillain appears, Electro (Jamie Foxx) an ex-employee of Oscorp Corp.\naccidentally turned into a blue skinned person with electric powers,\nthat seeks revenge from Spider Man. At the same time another super\nvillain assembles, Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan), previously Harry Osborn,\nthe owner of Oscop Corp., that turned himself to overcome a\ndegenerative disease and also for defeating the protagonist.\nDifferently from the previous movie, The Amazing Spider Man 2 had more\nspecial effects, more complex action scenes and more differentiated\nsoundtrack, as Electro's electric powers requires this developments to\nbe better represented compared to Lizard's powers. Even being an\noutstanding movie, in a technical way, what contributed to this movie\nnot being as good as the first one in a general way was the fact of\nhaving two villains. In the limited time of two and a half hours was\nnot possible to both of these very differently characters have the\nnecessary development to the public understand or create some\nconnection with them. Most of the time some more detailed explanations\nwould be necessary, as for instance detailing more how the power of the\nvillain works, or how the studies of Richard Parker, Peter's deceased\nfather, were developed and connected to Spider-Man's fate or\nintroducing some flash backs of how Peter and Harry met and became\nfriends. Furthermore, Amazing Spider Man 2, even though not being\nanother master piece of Marvel productions, is an spectacular action\nand visual movie, enjoyable to the hole public, but just only if\ncharacter development or the plot quality is not your priority.\n"},
{"review": "\nHaving multiple villains was a good idea. And linking in with the\noriginal spider man films due to the special projects area. Such as\nprofessor Octopuses arms. <br><br>Most of the film focuses on Elector or Sparky according to spider man.\nThen near the end there is the green goblin(Harry Osborn)then at the\nend the guy in the rhino robot. Not seeing the end of the fight was a\ngood touch. <br><br>I expect that the next film will probably have like a documentary\nplaying on the TV showing spider mans previous saves.

{"review": "\nLet me start off by saying I'm a huge Marvel/Graphic Novels/DC both\ncomics and films. The thing is, many of the films falls short for real\nfans of heroes, be it because the actor was poorly chosen (the blatant\ncase of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker). AWFUL! Hugh Jackman is a GOOD\nWolverine for instance and Brandon Routh was a pretty Good as C.K.,\nhaving big shoes to fill! Andrew Garfield looked a little strange in\nthese two films he starred, but only for the first five minutes, which\nare usually filled with \u00abwoo- hoos\u00bb and an action scene to\n\u00abre-introduce us\u00bb to Spidey (as if we need to be reminded of who he is,\nlol). So OK, we get a \u00abhappy-go-lucky Speder-Man and a somewhat\nair-headed Parker. But this is just for these five minutes, until one\ngets used to the character. Passed that, he is a pretty convincing\nP.P., throughout the movie, and adds a certain depth that was\nneeded.Good work there! The villain (main) is a fairly good choice, and\nthere's a vast choice within Spider's foes in the comics to make pretty\ngood movies. This is by far the best Spider-Man of all so far, and I'm\nnot even a fan! And to conclude, I think that as far as a Superhero\nmovie goes, it's very well directed, not \u00abcrazy-cams\u00bb like in\nTransformers, where you don't even keep up with who's fighting who! All\nin all, 8/10.\n"},
{"review": "\nAs a fan of Marvel, Spider-Man is one of their best in my opinion. The\ncomics are great, the film adaptations, however, I'm not that fond of.\nSpider-Man was just OK, Spider-Man 2 was flawless, Spider-Man 3 was\nreally bad, and The Amazing Spider-Man was good, but not memorable. I\nwalked in the theater with semi-high expectations, because I read some\nreviews and was skeptical about it. However, it was actually fantastic,\nand is definitely going in the best Marvel movies ever made. I was\nsurprised by the performances of Dane DeHaan(Green Goblin), and Andrew\nGarfield(Spider-Man), both fitting their roles very well.The special\neffects are spectacular and imaginative, particularly the web-slinging\nscenes and Electro's skin.

{"review": "\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 is more of the emotional side of Spider-\nMan/Peter Parker as he is trying to figure what he wants with Gwen,\nwhat to do with Harry, etc. We also see a lot of things we haven't seen\nin previous Spider-Man films(although very small) like him repairing\nhis web shooters or him washing his suit. Although they are very small\nthings it gives us the feel of what we love so much about Spidey, he is\njust an ordinary person ,who deals with financial struggles and\nheartache,not just a superhero. <br><br>However what let this movie down is what the other character\ndevelopment. We learn more about what makes Harry Osborne/Green Goblin\nangry and hating Spider-Man than we do Electro,who is the main villain\nof the movie. Every actor portrayed their characters perfectly but was\nlet down by a script that wasn't to thought out.\n"},

How can you claim that the costume was not perfect?\nThe most important, how can you deny that it was a spectacular film?\nWith especially its Times Square battle and Peter Parker, I think this\nmovie was nearly flawless. <br><br>If we talk about Rhino problem, I believe it was the best ending that\ncould have ever been made. Guys, don't be afraid, Rhino is not over\nyet. I think the next movie will start with Spiderman fighting with\nRhino. <br><br>And I also think Sony should keep on making swinging scenes like these,\nin the future. They were awesome.\n"},
{"review": "\n17 April 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza, Dorchester Tonight - The\nAmazing Spider-Man 2 (3D) - Marvellous Marvel does it again. If nothing\nelse a Marvel film is entertaining, but this film was definitely better\nthan just entertaining. A mix of superhero, ordinary folk, internal\nstruggles and battles against the bad guys, this film also had quite a\nfew laugh out loud moments too. One of the most telling story lines yet\nthis episode deals with the internal struggles that Peter Parker goes\nthrough to balance his everyday life, with family, love of his girl and\nhis obligation to save the general population. I know as the audience\nwe are privy to all the secrets on the good side and the bad side, but\nit never ceases to amaze me that the person closest to him, his Aunt\nMay, has never discovered the spider suit which is just sitting in a\nheap in his closet, open your eyes lady, the guy you raised from a\nsmall boy is one of the coolest super heroes around. I quite like\nAndrew Garfield as Spider Man, he balances his fun side with the angst\nneeded to capture this story line to perfection. 3D gets better and\nbetter by the way!!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nI watched a lot of superhero movies and this one is in my top 3 along\nwith The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. I see all the bad\nreviews saying bad things about spidey, about Andrew Garfield and\ncomparing this to Twillight. I really do not get those people. Let me\ntell you why.<br><br>Firstly because Andrew Garfield fits perfectly for the role of Peter\nParker and also does Emma Stone for Gwen Stacy. A real, honest love\nbetween these two characters. It is so powerful that I felt it when\nthey look at each other, talk to each other and in every other romantic\nscene. I know you expect a great superhero movie with a lot of action,\nwith a good villain but this movie is something more than just a\nsuperhero movie. This is a really great romance that in the end it\nalmost made me cry. <br><br>Another thing about this movie is that I really like the villain and\nJamie Foxx was really good at being Electro. Not much action and\nbattles between spiderman and Electro but that is what makes this\nsuperhero movie so special.<br><br>And the last thing may contain a little spoiler(do not read it if you\nwant to watch the movie for the 1st time). It has an really amazing\ntwist at the very end when Gwen dies and like I said it almost made me\ncry. So I can not wait for the 3rd movie of this trilogy.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen I saw this movie I had very high expectations due to enjoying its\npredessesor. It surpassed them when I saw this on opening night. The\ntwo main villain arcs are very well done as are all the characters.\nThey are engaging and are what the directors clearly wanted to drive\nthis movie. That and the tense action sequences impressed me greatly.\nPeople say this is has too many subplots and here is the thing, the\nspiderman comic books are all driven by subplots with one huge plot\nhiding in the shadows and this film makes me excited for the sequels\ndue to its pitch perfect storytelling and perfect performances. I saw\nspiderman from the comics not people dressing up for halloween.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe original trilogy seemed incomplete but now, that incompleteness is\ncompleted by this new one. I love the background story of Spiderman\nshown in this movie, at least it has got one unlike the original. The\nstory of how Peter Parker ended up with his Uncle and Aunt, the story\nof why \"Peter Parker\" is the only one who could be Spiderman and no-one\nelse. It all feels complete now. A satisfactory plot for a superhero\nmovie.<br><br>Talking about the performances, I like the new Peter Parker, humorous\nand entertainer. I've started to feel the original 'Peter Parker' was\nactually boring. Really good job by the actors here. And with that\nSuperVillian : 'Electro', the movie becomes one of the best SuperHero\nmovies. Visual effects are quite good and the movie is perfectly\nentertaining. For me, this is the best version of Spiderman movie till\nnow. I don't care what the critics have to say, this movie is a good\none.\n"},

I'm glad since I can't imagine anyone else doing\nit so well.<br><br>Hope the next one will be even better than this,<br><br>Go see it, and enjoy!\n"},
{"review": "\nFor starters, let me say that this is not a perfect movie. The first\nact is rushed, and the plot loosens as the movie progresses. But this\nis what comic book movies should be like. Fun, action-packed, and\nbelievable performances are what make this movie good. It is not trying\nto be The Dark Knight, which I enjoyed. There are a few darker moments,\nbut the overall feel of the movie is light and fun. That tone is\nperfect for Spidey movies, and that is where I think Sam Raimi went\nwrong with his Spider-Man trilogy. He wanted to make a good film, not a\ngood Spider-Man film. Mark Webb is making good Spider-Man films, so\ncritics are not liking it because they view it the same as they would\nShawshank Redemption. And fans aren't on board because they want all\nsuperhero movies to be \"darker\". Ask Man Of Steel how that worked out.\nSo just sit back and enjoy a fun ride with beautiful visuals and\noutstanding acting.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was not excited about this movie at all. The trailers looked bloated\nwith CGI action and it reminded me of spider-man 3,with the overuse of\nvillains,and Dane DeHaan as the green goblin? That looked ridiculous. I\nthink its safe to say that this movie was one of the most surprising\nmovies I've seen in a while. It started out a bit cartoonish,but in a\ngood way,it felt like spider-man. They balanced out the 3 villains\nreally well and you believed Jamie,Dane and Paul as the villains they\nportray. Andrew Garfield absolutely owns the roll of spider-man,as we\ncould already tell back in 2012 with the first movie. Emma stone is\nstill killing it as Gwen Stacey and you really end up caring for their\nrelationship. This movie takes a lot from the Amazing Spider-man issues\n#120 and #121,so if you've read those devastating comic books you know\nabout the chilling end one of the main characters will face. In\nconclusion,the only people who wont enjoy this movie are either\nAnti-superhero tight-asses or people who generally hate fun. Enjoy.\n"},
{"review": "\nSo soon after Tobey Maguire's Spiderman Trilogy, the decision to reboot\nthe franchise may have been seen as bizarre to some. However, the first\nin this new series, Amazing Spider-Man, was thoroughly entertaining,\nand this second instalment has similarly impressed. In the film,\nSpider-Man has to deal with new enemies including Electro and the Green\nGoblin, as well as Rhino. The action scenes were refreshingly good and,\nalthough there were too many romantic scenes for my liking, which in\nturn made the movie slightly too long, they were humorous at times -\nthroughout the movie, there were scenes which triggered a few laughs\nfrom the audience which lightened up the production. Having said that,\nI don't think that it was as dark as the first instalment. All in all,\na film worth seeing.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen I watched the trailer my expectations is much higher but after I\nwatch the movie it didn't satisfy my all expectations. Of course it\ncan't satisfy everybody's all expectations at the same time. <br><br>The film is generally very good. In the way of Electro's creation is\nvery good, Green Goblin could be better. Harry did very less research\nabout secret projects it didn't mention there it can heal the body.\nAlso spider venom effect Harry very fast. It start to effect Peter in a\nday or less but effect Harry like 10 seconds. Also slow motions are\nperfect and it happened the time it should be. Fight with Electro and\nspecial effects were very good. It is good to see what happened to\nPeter's family. Gwen's death was shocked me. I don't understand how she\ndie. Is her back broken or is she hit the ground before Peter catch\nher. Anyway \u0131n my opinion she shouldn't be dead in this movie maybe she\ncan die in next movie or in the next movie she can go somewhere else\nand leave Peter. If it is go like that next movie Aunt May is going to\ndie. Comedy is good somewhere but somewhere it is unnecessary. Rhino's\ntype is little different maybe because I saw it only in Spider-Man\ncartoon. End credit scene could be about next Spider-Man movie.It was\nunnecessary to add a scene about X-men. <br><br>There are minuses but the pluses is more than that I suggest anyone to\nsee that film and it is far better than first movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was really surprised after watching this movie! Not only was the VFX\nextremely good, but the plot was also awesome and detailed.

I feel that Marc Webb (the director) has learned\nfrom his mistakes, no more wannabe spidey, no more trying to funny! And\nfinally, finally, we learn more about his parents. The story is\nrealistic, if you think about it in a superhero movie perspective. They\nshow you the sad part of spiderman's story, they show you the phycology\nof spidey and almost all the enemies.

{"review": "\nFirst off, I'd like to say that I really did not like the first Amazing\nSpider-Man, so my expectations were really low coming in to part 2. I\nwas pleasantly surprised by it though. This movie has action, comedy\nand drama in a perfect balance. I was worried that there would be too\nmany bad guys in this movie, but they did it just right. If I had one\ncomplaint, it would be that Harry Osborne's transition to the Green\nGoblin could have been done differently, it felt a bit rushed to me,\nbut the rest of the movie makes up for it. Another highlight for me was\nthe soundtrack and score of the movie. The music when Electro is in\nTimes Square is amazingly well done.<br><br>Overall I liked this movie a lot because it really felt like the\nSpider-Man I knew from the comics. <br><br>There was a mid credits scene of the X-Men: Days of Future Past movie,\nbut I really didn't like that scene.\n"},

If you have read the comic books,\nthen you'll understand where I'm coming from when you see this movie.<br><br>The only downside/s I feel this movie has is that Jamie Foxx, in my\nopinion, doesn't really fit his character and I felt that he didn't\nreally have a massive say in the whole film, it was more about the\nother villain - but what I did like is that having two villains didn't\nmake it feel like there was too much going on; it was very\nunderstandable and a pleasurable viewing experience, so the director\nreceives points in my book for his story telling.<br><br>This review is really brief as I don't want to sway your opinion on the\nfilm before you've watched it, but rather to change your opinion on\nwhether you should watch it, and I believe that you definitely should.\n"},

Although the plot get vaguely wrapped around between Electro and\nthe Oscorp, it is still interesting to watch the character development. <br><br>So what takes 2 stars away from me? It would be the complicated bonds\nbetween a young couple, Peter and Gwen, who just can't make up their\nmind by being hesitant, especially in the middle of the movie. I mean,\nit is normal for any couples to experience erratic emotions, but the\nwhole romance definitely can be succinct to intensify other aspects.<br><br>Despite a number of downsides, I would still strongly recommend this to\nanyone who is itching to watch a different type of feisty film. Because\nno movies can offer such a sticky, nifty, and vigorous action like \"The\nAmazing Spider-Man 2.\" Yes, it is as good as the first one, or like\nothers say, it is better.\n"},
{"review": "\nWith much speculation about the success of this film, it surprisingly,\nyet thankfully, lived up to the billing! With expectation high despite\nthe seemingly mediocre Amazing Spiderman it seemed impractical and\nimplausible to believe this film would be any different.

This was\nalready hyped up more so by the pretext of a more intricate storyline\nwhich was implied by the previous film's ending. So it proved.

They should've made a fun adventure Spider Man movie and a\nsappy romance, instead of horribly combining the two. The product\nplacement\u00ae(Sony) would be glaring for anyone not accustomed to it\ngetting shoved down their throat at every movie, like we all are. Mary\nJane or whatever her name is, dies near the end of the movie in a\nhorrible clich\u00e9 scene that made me burst out laughing. After that,\nRhino makes a brief appearance and then the movie ends exactly the same\nas the trailer did. The whole point of a trailer is to provide\nanticipation for things that will get resolved in the movie that they\nwant to sell to you, but they just cheap'd out and decided to not even\nfilm that scene. But don't worry, it'll all be in the next movie!\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Amazing Spider-man is a total failure before.. So this part 2 still\nfail quite bad.. I'm really sick of the whole plot.. There are no basic\nresponsible of a super hero.. He is trying to show off that he is\nspider- man every chance he had.. In part 1 he is taking off his mask\nvery often showing his face and showing off his new skills to people..\nNow wooing Gwen like a spoiled kid in his spidey suit trying to make\nher stay when she is leaving? And spinning a huge web saying I Love You\ntelling the whole world.. W T F? If he is wooing Gwen as Peter Parker,\nthat is still acceptable.. Wooing Gwen in spider-man suit makes him\nlook like a skirt chasing whim who tries to impress girls with his\nspider-man identity.. Totally spoils the image of spider-man.. Just\nwatch the Spider Man 1-3 by Tobey Maguire.. At least he brings out the\nspider-man with discipline and of some sense.. And not behaving like\nsome brat trying to show off and chase after some girl he had a crush\non with his spider-man suit.\n"},
{"review": "\nBased on the fact that I did not enjoy the first movie, I lowered my\nexpectations yet still tried to judge this film on its own merit. Even\nso, I have to classify this effort as an absolute film travesty. It is\nall kinds of awful.<br><br>I seriously am searching for something to like and I do absolutely love\nthe character. Spidey looks great and I really do like the cast. It's\ntoo bad they gave them such a dumb story and such a bad script to\nshoot. There are so many things wrong with this effort that it's tough\nto sum up my utter contempt for what I saw unfold on screen. What\nstruck me about an hour and a half in to the run time was the fact that\nnothing major was happening yet they managed to develop NOT one single\ncharacter. Everything feels shallow and most nothing connects. They\nbook end the film with cheesy Rhino moments that really deserve all the\n\"Batman &amp; Robin\" comparisons that I've read. (Spider-Man messing around\nin the opening truck chase should have gotten dozens of people killed\nfor no reason) Seeing New Yorkers standing behind instant barricades\nwatching gun battles and explosions happening less than 100 yards away\nas if it was some sort of Spider-Man sports contest actually made me\ncringe. That happens three times during the film. Electro was\nridiculous and again, the parallels to the worst films the genre has\never produced are real and tangible. Harry Osborn is yet another wasted\nand unbelievable cheesy character.<br><br>I do award a few salvation points for actually giving Aunt May a few\nscenes to shine (unlike the first film.) The action is completely\nforgettable except for the final Goblin showdown. That was well done\n(more salvation points). The slo-mo vibe is terrible and the soundtrack\nseverely detracts from everything. The dialogue is as bad as it gets as\nis EVERYONE'S motivation.<br><br>Overall, I'm a Marvel fan that is actually offended by how bad this\nturned out.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 was Just Awesome! good villains in the Movie\nLike Electro. played by Jamie Foxx who did very good playing as him and\nGreen Goblin &amp; Rhino at the end of the film. the film was good as the\nAmazing Spider-Man which had The Lizard in it.<br><br>and pretty all i have to say about this movie it's fun entertaining to\nwatch especially it's awesome fight scenes with electro and spider-\nman. and Andrew Garfield &amp; Emma Stone did great in the sequel too. Marc\nWebb's spider-man film series seems so much better than What you would\nExpect for a Better Spider-Man movie series. &amp; i know Sam Raimi's\ndidn't end not a good conclusion with spider-man 3 since it was not\nthat great of a movie. But Sill Like i said I Would Definitely\nRecommend this to anyone who is Spider-Man Fan. so the Movie gets a\nthumbs up and still good movie and i liked it when i First got to see\nit. just good! something i didn't expect for any Spider-Man Movie\nstill. But overall thumbs up for this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is really amazing whatever what critics or other said this\nmovie is really good, it may not be the best super-hero movie but it\nstill enjoyable to watch well i love this movie because the actors\nremind me the characters of the comics. Spider-man suits was like the\ncomics.<br><br>I think Andrew Garfield is the best Spider-man he pulled the spider-\nman from the comics perfectly with the perfect humour,Emma Stone as\nGwen Stacy was portrayed perfectly, Dane D. as Harry O. was really\namazing, he is the perfect Harry O. and a great Green Goblin i like the\npsychology in the scene were he appeared as Green Goblin and Peter was:\n''Why did you do that???'', he was more darker than James Franco (but\nhe was good either), Jamie F. as the electric blue villain was okay but\nthe special effects was really awesome.<br><br>the battle scenes were great and I really love the Spider-man(his\nfather use to work with Os-corp till he discovered that they were doing\nsomething illegal he is the good one) vs the Green Goblin(the son of\nthe director of Os-corp witch he's the bad one) both best friend\nfighting. <br><br>The ending with the Rhino was great to me (if it wasn't spoiled on the\ntrailer or even on the poster because the epic battle with the Rhino\nwas not in the movie) I also like the little kid scene it was very\ntouching, they had a cut scene/alternate ending in the DVD Blu Ray\nshowing that Peter's father was actually alive this was really more\ntouching I even cried for it it was so good.<br><br>This movie had great actors on it I just can't stand the Toby fan's who\nthink that Spider-man 3 is a lot better I mean never Spider-man 3 is\none of the worst super-hero movie I have ever seen in my entire life.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a little late for a review i watched this back in 2014 in\ntheatre with high expectations. Now lets talk about the film, it's the\nworst marvel film ever made. Wrong Portrayal of Peter parker By Andrew\nGarfield. In this Duology, Peter is a cool guy which he was not in the\nprevious films. Girls didn't talk to him, ignored him Just as in\nSpiderman 1,2,3 Same as in the Comics, in this film he is not Serious\nAt all. Taking everything Lightly and got gwen killed. Getting Back to\nthe film, a failure that cant be forgotten. They had many stories to\ntake from The comics but what the f**k is this S**t ? Terrible Acting\nfrom Jamie Foxx. I think he was Over-acting portraying Electro. The\nRemember the game was released back in 2012 during the first film but\nthe game was in fact the sequel of the film released the same year.\nThey could've followed the same story in which the cross-species virus\nspreads and the lizard returns.\n"},
{"review": "\nJeez, big spider-man fan here but boy this is the worst Spidey movie of\nthe lot. I know Sony had only one superhero blockbuster and were trying\nto milk this movie as much as possible by setting up future spin-offs\nthat thankfully didn't come into fruition. Starting with Andrew\nGarfield himself, his chemistry with Emma stone was kinda good and\npeople say he was a better spider-man than Tobey i just wasn't sold on\nhis performance. Then the elephant in the room, JAMIE FOXX AS\nELECTRO,this was one of the silliest villains ever put to film just\nbehind whiplash from iron man 2. His motivations were so lazy and they\nkept making up his powers as they went. Whats there to say, people that\nwatched this at the cinemas probably wanted their money back cause this\nmovies full of it\n"},
{"review": "\nStunning Spidey SFX and an impressive Production all around highlight\nthis Sequel that comes off, overall, better than the first one. But the\nenormous amount of Romantic Angst, combined with the Parker Family's\nsuffering from loss, is a bit much for a Super-Hero Movie and the\nMelodramatics and Emotional tugging bring this one down. There's just\ntoo much internal turmoil for this type of thing.<br><br>The Story outside the Personal Stuff is OK and there are layers upon\nlayers of interesting happenings. Jamie Foxx's \"Electro\" is flashy and\nfantastic at times. The CGI is bright, glaring, and gaudy, but works\nnonetheless. There are many other Characters in an around Osborn Corp.\nHarry (Dane DeHaan) shows up. So does His Dad briefly. <br><br>Oscorp is shown to be an Evil breeding ground for present and future\nSuper-Villains like Rhino, who makes a Cameo and there are hints of\nothers. Overall, an acceptable entertainment, but these Comic-Book\nMovies have become such a huge part of the Cinematic Lexicon that\nexpectations are high every time out and Fanboys are always pushing for\nperfection.<br><br>This one was considered a Flop, both commercially and critically, and\n#3 is a no go. Where is Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) headed? Search the\n\"Web\".\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 has technical merits. However, these merits\nare impossible to enjoy in a film drowned from beginning to end in the\nsickening narcissism of both its purported hero and supposedly tragic\nvillains.I give you The Amazing Spider-Man: a hero with no principles\nand no goals.by sometimes he only cares about his girlfriend and\nsometimes wants to know what happened to his parents, but day-to-day he\nreally only cares about doing what he wants to do-- which happens to be\nhelping people, it seems, because it gives them hope.Electro could have\nbeen a tragic Frankenstein villain. Instead, because a group of random\npeople roots for Spider-Man over him in his first public appearance, he\ndecides everyone should die. Yup--that's his motivation.I really like\nspiderman as a series, and I think Andrew Garfield does take on this\nmore gloomy and dark version of spidey/peter parker, it works quite\nwell and I hope that they make many more in the series.but Electro come\non, he should have died in that fish tank and not become this\nelectrical super freak evil bad guy. Give me the two other evil enemies\nat the end, Dane DeHaan really fits his part both as Harry Osborne, but\nalso as the Goblin it is really good. The Rhino that we briefly see in\nthe end is really fitting in my universe of spiderman and the evil\nfiends he has to battle, so for my sake those are the one they should\ngo for.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe latest Amazing Spider-Man 2014 + 2012 are Not a patch on the\noriginal Spider-Man 2002, 2004 + 2007 Not having a Web Gland just\nspoils the movies.

{"review": "\nWhereas the era of Toby Maguire's Spiderman was marked by a Peter\nParker wound up tighter than a coiled spring and on the verge of tears\non several occasions, Garfield's Spiderman is more at ease with\nhimself, and certainly more street-wise. He is tougher in some\nrespects, but also more likable as a character, which shines through\nquite a lot for me in this film.<br><br>The almost-forced love story between Parker and Mary-Jane in the first\nthree Spiderman films is replaced by a more natural, gentle portrayal,\nand the on-screen chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma is better\nthan that between Maquire and Kirsten Dunst. <br><br>The primary villain of the piece, Electro, is well-performed by Jamie\nFoxx but the character is a little clich\u00e9d and to be honest, doesn't\nget enough screen time either. I rather liked the new spin on Harry\nOsborn, who, like Parker, is less of an emotional wreck and, despite\nsome acts of petulance, is more likable than James Franco's\ninterpretation. His transition into the Goblin is motivated more out of\ndesperation than anything else, so he garners more sympathy than\nbefore.<br><br>The action sequences are well staged and manage to convey a strong\nsense of excitement and tension.

{"review": "\nFelt this was much better than first movie. Lot of stories in this one.\nMany parts are rather boring though. And watching the same spiderman in\noriginal storyline and after few years from Sam Raimi's version with\ntwisted storyline is pretty lame to watch. If this was a series\nreleased after a decade or so, then it would have better. And story in\nSam Raimi's version, though twisted and not close to original comic\nbook storyline, was very much likable. <br><br>Personally did not like acting skills of Garfield. Don't think he has\ndone well in scenes he as to engage with Emma Stone.

{"review": "\nI enjoyed The Amazing Spider-Man 2 for the most part. Andrew Garfield\nonce again proves to be a great Peter Parker/Spider-man and the\nwondrous Emma Stone returns as Gwen Stacy. These two are my saving\ngrace for the film, the chemistry between the two was superb, snapping\nbetween fun chit-chat to romantic interests was easily the biggest\nstrength of the movie. <br><br>With that being said, Spider-Man is about the VILLAINS, with such a\nwide universe of material and villains to choose from Sony opted to go\nwith Max Dillon a.k.a Electro, with Jamie Foxx leading the role. Foxx\nis chilling as Max, he is twisted, disturbed and straight up weird,\nunfortunately his performance as Electro isn't quite as impressive ...\nThere are some great scenes involving Spider-man and Electro\nspecifically the Times Square sequence, but his character is let down\nby some awfully cheesy dialogue, \"It's my birthday, time to light the\ncandle\" *cringe* <br><br>But aside from this scene there isn't much more of them both. This\nleads on to the films biggest weakness, it's convoluted plot. Director\nMarc Webb tries to set up an entire Spider-Man universe by creating\nplot points which will be resolved in future films in one film. This\nmakes the movie seem as just a prelude of what is to come, Harry\nOsborne and Peter barely get any development as friends and instead\nbecome sworn enemies by the end.<br><br>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't a 'bad' film like some people say ... It\ndefinitely isn't Spider-Man 3! In fact it's far from it, a couple of\nkey issues revolving plot and villain let the film down, but it is\nstill a fun experience.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe first Amazing Spider-man was decent but not outstanding. I wasn't\nreally expecting much from this film until I went to go see it, and it\nblew my mind. The acting was great. The music is way better than the\nfirst one, because Hans Zimmer took over. And the effects are pretty\ngood. The love story is great and actually makes you care about these\ntwo characters. The only reason why I didn't give this movie a perfect\n10/10 is because of the overload of unnecessary villains and the\noverall character development with Harry. The movie contains some\nhumour that doesn't ruin epic scenes like MCU sometimes does. Overall\nthis movie is worth watching.\n"}
