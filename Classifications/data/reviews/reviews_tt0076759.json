{"review": "\nStar wars made epic fantasy real. For a generation of people it has\ndefined what the cinema experience is meant to be. Today it is probable\nthat pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment\nsolution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic\nemotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better\nexample of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When\nyou think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at\nthe time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K\neconomic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army\ncollecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically\nadvanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars let\neverybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that was\nuncertain but ultimately good.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThere's not much to say about this movie this is *THE* movie that changed it\nall.<br><br>It's my favourite movie, and not only among the quadrilogy, among all\nmovies; it has everything that can be great in a movie, great characters,\ngreat story, great sights, great special effects (they don't show 23 years)\nand a mythological background that made us dream for decades now, and\nthat'll keep us dreaming for a long, long time. Maybe the characters I liked\nmost in this one are Old Obi-Wan Kenobi, wonderfully portrayed by Alec\nGuinness, and Han Solo, Harrison Ford's first important role, they're both\ngreat.<br><br>Not to mention John Williams' wonderful score, without of it, the movie\nwouldn't have been this great it's a perfect mix, that's what it\nis!\n"},
{"review": "\nI can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have\ndifferent effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my\nfavorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats\nStar Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different\ncreatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped\nin the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion\nthat has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most\nfascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still\na Star Wars nerd.<br><br>The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most\ntragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this\nnew universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the\nrun from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a\nsmuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my\nfavorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the\ncoolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start\nto feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice\nthat can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.<br><br>This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it\nwas the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for\nbeing able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for\nwhat was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films\never. <br><br>10/10\n"},

{"review": "\nStar Wars is great cinema. One of the great things about it is the\nvisuals, the opening shot where the Star Destroyer flies over while\nchasing the Rebel Blockade Runner is amazing. The music is also\nfantastic, it evokes early epic movie scores by the likes of Erich\nWolfgang Korngold and Miklos Rozsa and also hearkens back to Classical\nmusic in the romantic period, especially to Wagner and Holst. The\ncharacters and story are somewhat basic but that's part of whats great\nabout the movie, it has an archetypal, mythic quality.<br><br>Some have said that the only reason this movie is highly regarded is\nbecause of people who as as children and idolize it for nostalgic\nreasons, well as someone who saw for the first time at the age of 16, I\ncan attest that it's stands on it's own very well.<br><br>It does have a few flaws.

Comments have\nbeen made about the film that it has a simple story and that the movie has\nsimple characters.  While all of these claims may have some validity, to say\nthat the film has no depth is unfair.  When one studies how much thought\nreally was put in Lucas' trilogy, they should be amazed.\nWhile the film borrows from mythology, Lucas has made sure that each\nfilm has a major twist from its ancestors.  In the first film for example,\nLuke goes to rescue a princess, but instead she is the one that ends up\nsaving him.\nNot only does the story telling have a twist on classic mythology, it\nhas an underlying theme and many sub-themes that no other movie can match.\nAfter studying the trilogy, redemption is the theme most often explored.\nEvery major \"good\" character in the trilogy at one time falls and then\nredeems himself. The ultimate redemption being Darth Vader who will be the\nmain character in the new trilogy being developed as I\ntype.\nAs for the characters being simple, this seems unfair.  They are\narchtypes.  Characters common throughout all cultures.  Also, all the major\ncharacters have motivation for their actions unlike most good guy/bad guy\nmovies.  The bad guys in the films are bad because of human flaws such as\nthe struggle for power and greed.  They are not simple bad for bad's sake.\nEven the main villain of the trilogy becomes very human by the end of the\ntrilogy when he redeems himself.  The film doesn't show the bad guys only as\nsomething to shoot at, but as human beings that have been lead astray.  The\ntwo trilogies are ultimately about how a human being can become a monster,\nand that a monster is still a human being in the end.\nThe Star Wars trilogy has more depth than at first glance.

Kenobi tells Luke\nof the battle of the rebels against the ruling Empire and the spiritual\nenergy called \"The Force.\" Soon Luke, Kenobi, and a mercenary named Han\nSolo (Harrison Ford) join forces to rescue Princess Leia from the\nEmpire's mammoth warship, the Death Star, controlled by evil genius\nDarth Vader (David Prowse, with the voice of James Earl Jones).\n"},

The acting, directing, writing, production design, special\neffects, and anything else I've forgotten, is simply top-notch. This\nmovie did so many things for film, most notably the special effects,\nbut it also gave us three of the greatest young actors of the late 70s\nand 80s, Mark Hammill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford.

{"review": "\nThis film single-handedly changed modern cinema to what we know it to\nbe today. It is the ultimate modern fairy tale. A young knight runs off\nwith a wise old wizard to save the princess from the clutches of evil.\nOf course, it runs a little deeper than that, and makes the old tale of\ngood versus evil so much more compelling. Setting it long ago in a\ngalaxy far, far away is pure genius and it introduces us to a\nfuturistic galaxy of beautiful style and diversity that leaves us with\na fantastic space opera. Despite its unfamiliar setting, we can relate\nto all the characters. There's the handsome maverick, the beautiful\nheroine, the aspiring young knight, the wise old mentor, and the darkly\nclad villain. Even the droids are characters we can recognise and\nrelate to. What is so special about this film is that the distractions\nof things like politics, geography, and nationality are eliminated to\nleave us with simple humanity. This film has everything you could ever\nwant. The characters are great; the action's great; the story is\nmagnificent, and of course there's philosophy too.... Oh, what am I\ntalking about?

The success of Star Wars is\nultimately due to the wonderful imagination of its director and of\ncourse to the extremely well orchestrated cast.

Most action and sci-fi films aim to be\ncompared to star wars, a feat that is rare and, in my opinion, has only\nbeen achieved by Terminator 1 and 2, the lord of the rings trilogy and\nmarvels: the avengers.<br><br>A new hope works brilliantly as a first chapter to a saga, however, I\nfeel that it works better as a stand alone film.

Even if it's not the\nbest film in the series (it's not), Star Wars deserves its own place in\nthe history of cinema, as a work that changed Hollywood forever. It\nbrought back the grandness of the epic cinema of the 30's and 40's and\nmultiplied it, creating a new era of spectacle and excitement.<br><br>Unlike the rest of the films, there's absolutely no need for an\nexpanded universe or a complete saga to appreciate the original Star\nWars by its own right. It's a complete tale, a classic saga that takes\nits queues from historical epics, samurai films and serials, and\ncontains every aspect of the timeless hero's journey. The fact that it\ntakes place 'in a galaxy far, far away' is trivial - though it did help\nthe film have a bigger impact.<br><br>Star Wars has very little to do with science fiction; not much of the\nscience in it makes any sense, it might as well be magic. But that's\nwhat made it so powerful, and what made the prequels - that tried to\nexplain everything away - so disappointing.

{"review": "\nGeorge Lucas spent four years developing and working on the galactic\nfantasy Star Wars. This was after he directed the dystopian\nscience-fiction film THX 1138 (1971) and the rites-of-passage American\nGraffiti (1973). Star Wars was inspired by the Flash Gordon cartoon\nstrip. It cost $8 million to make in Britain with three little-known\nAmericans in the leading roles, supported by British actors. The story\nis a simple adventure yarn, and Lucas draws on samurai films, Westerns\nand every kind of myth, ancient and modern. The dogfights are based on\na close study of World War II films. Star Wars was an immediate\nsuccess. It became one of the great phenomena of cinematic history. It\nspawned two sequels, three prequels and endless imitators, creating a\ndemand for spectacular blockbusters that has not yet ended. Industrial\nLight and Magic, the special effects unit that served the film, became\na multi-billion dollar organization. Lucas himself also became and has\nremained one of Hollywood's most powerful figures. The film certainly\nstruck a nerve in an America recovering from the humiliations of the\nVietnam war. Ronald Reagan, elected president three years after Star\nWars was made, spoke of the Soviet Union as 'the Evil Empire' and gave\nhis proposed space-defense system the title Star Wars. The original\nStar Wars trilogy contributed to the worldwide renewal of the filmgoing\nhabit, but in creating an appetite for child-like blockbusters that\ndepend on special effects rather than on character and subtle\nnarrative, the film unfortunately played a key role in what was to be\ncalled 'the dumbing down' of America and popular culture.\n"},

{"review": "\nA low budget sci-fi popcorn flick that changed movies and Hollywood\nforever!<br><br>I don't know where to start with this film as it changed the world. We\nhad had some SFX in old fantasy films like Sinbad or Jason and the\nargonauts or space oddessy 2001 but when I sat down I the cinema for\nthe fist time nothing could prepare me for what was about to happen!<br><br>The opening sequence where the camera pans down to the planet followed\nby the rebel ship and then the star destroyer flying over your head. No\none had seen or imagined anything like this was possible let alone\nwatching it right before their eyes! And it kept on getting better!<br><br>it was like having a black &amp;a white TV and then suddenly walking into a\n3D IMAX! You couldn't comprehend what was actually happening. <br><br>There is often a debate about the greatest movie of all time. Some say\nCitizen Kane or Shawshank to name a few but for me it's Star Wars and\nEmpire Strikes Back. <br><br>The score is ahead of its time. To be honest nothing has ever come\nclose. It makes a massive impact on all 3 original films. <br><br>Let's review it by breaking it down:<br><br>Story - classic story which had stood the test of time Special Effect -\nabsolutely amazing Set design - original, faultless and imaginative\nMusical score - absolute classic Pace of the film - spot on<br><br>When I first saw this film I was blown away! I had never seen anything\nlike it and come to think of it I really have. for me it's an all time\nclassic that changed the movie industry for ever.<br><br>If you're sitting at home reading this, rake it out and watch it now.\nIt will put a smile on your face and that's what it's all about.<br><br>For those who haven't given this a 10 I can't understand it. <br><br>The movie that is the definition of 'a movie'\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie has defined a generation, and spawned a multimedia empire.\nWith its now classic scrolling text, it created a new genre of film -\nthe space opera. Influenced by Joseph Campbell, Lucas created a space\nwestern that hadn't been re-created since in any serious way. Even the\nmuch loved Firefly never had the same cult following. Star Wars'\ntimeless feel resides in its classic archetypes the white hats. black\nhats to boo, and a classic princess to be rescued. It has a John Ford\nfeel, with comedic relief in the twin yin yang feel of the droids R2-D2\nand C3P0, the teacher with Obiwan, the lovable rogue Han Solo, the\nsidekick with a heart of gold Chewie, the student Skywalker and the\nlove interest with a kick Lea. This is one film series that will end up\noutliving us all.\n"},
{"review": "\nI remember when I was 9 years old when this movie was repeated on\nchannel 10 and I found it really enjoyable to watch. The story is very\nstrong for a SCIF movie. The costumes are very good for the aliens and\nthe robots too. The most likable characters are Luke sykerwalker Han\nSolo and C3po and R2D2 But I think its the droids are the ones who\nsteal the comedy in this movie As always the story always go for a part\n2 so their is always a little more more to the story and secrets being\nrevealed latter on in the series. Overall This is another classic\nmasterpiece that is wroth watching. <br><br>10/10\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat really stood out to me after watching The Force Awakens a couple\nof times and coming back to A New Hope was how focused it is. It's\nconfident in the world it's building and it doesn't try to rush\neverything. It's not afraid to be weird. I mean it has robots, who\naren't even the main characters, walking around in the desert for 5\nminutes. Few, if any, blockbusters have that kind of confidence these\ndays.<br><br>I'm amazed at how much the film expects you to accept in just a short\namount of time, but it works because it allows the audience to take in\nthe world. In comparison, TFA has ADHD (not that I hate it).<br><br>Yes, some of the special effects are dated and some of Luke's lines are\ncringe-worthy, but it is full of heart and that can be felt throughout\nthe film.<br><br>People laugh at the poor choreography of Vader and Obi-Wan's final\nduel, but in my opinion it is still one of the best in the series. Not\nbecause of how they are fighting, but because of why they are fighting.\nAlmost every line in that duel is classic.<br><br>Another good thing is that ANH can stand on its own. It's\nself-contained and it tells a relatively complete story. These days, a\nlot of movies that are meant to spawn franchises suffer from\nsequel-baiting. While the possibility of a sequel is hinted at, the\nfilm itself doesn't hinge of having one.<br><br>It's a shame we can't get a proper restoration of the original version,\nbut despite all the additions, ANH still maintains its essence.<br><br>That I've watched it so many times and still haven't gotten bored of it\nis a testament to how good it is. Few films have ever left an\nimpression on me like this one. I don't think it can just be nostalgia.\nMany films that I liked as a child I later realized weren't as good as\nI remembered, but not A New Hope.\n"},

Now lets start with the New\nHope: It opened on May 1977 and after that the world as a whole changed\nbig time. This movie is even studied as the archetype of the hero\njourney and made the words like ,lightsabers, the Force, Jedi and names\nlike Lya ,Luke , Han Solo and of course Darth Vader known world\nwide.Every science fiction flick or TV series after 1977 is in, one way\nor an order, a child ,godchild or imitator of Star Wars. From Guardians\nof the Galaxy to Rick and Morty and almost anything in between. The\nimpact can be seen in movies or series from totally different genres,\nfor instance due to its success studios decided to invest in the\nsuperhero stories that inspire George Lucas to create this\nunforgettable saga and from that it came Richard Donner's Superman ,Tim\nBurton's Batman and the 1992 X-men series and Batman the animated\nseries ,which are the fathers (spoilers) of the superhero genre ,which\nnow dominates Hollywood. In simple ,no Star Wars, no Superheroes!! If\nyou have not watch it ,I feel sorry for you and go do it now!!\n"},

{"review": "\nOh, boy. Reviewing a film that so many critics have been writing about\nis so hard, but also deserves a try for sure. The original Star Wars is\nnot that kind of movie you love because it's so well made or so complex\nand deep; you love it because it makes you happy. George Lucas back in\nthe day didn't want to create the perfect sci-fi movie (he says so in a\nRolling Stones review), as that was \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" in his\nopinion; he wanted to make something special in its lightness, a space\nopera not focusing on space (as did its future rival, Star Trek), but\non a very, very simple story of a rescue (and later on in the saga, a\nfamily). Each character is just perfect in his role: Luke, the hero,\nwith his strong sense of duty; Han Solo, the roughneck, a guy whose\nrole in the universe is not yet written but soon will be; Princess\nLeia, a role model for girls at a time when a woman leading a group of\nadventurers was just fantasy. And this is just the main squad. I won't\ndwell on the amazing comedic commentary by the two droids (one of\nwhich, without a single word, became the favorite character of many\nfans!), the ominous figure of the mysterious Darth Vader and the mentor\nObi-Wan Kenobi, with the delicate role of introducing us to the\nmystical side of this world, the Force. No movie is perfect for me, and\nin this case I'll have to state the one, unimportant flaw in the whole\noriginal trilogy: the acting in itself isn't great and some points of\nthe plot are off. That said, the chemistry between the actors is\npalpable and the story is so funny, you don't need to stress every\naspect of it.<br><br>When every single scene in a movie is canon, you know you're watching a\nmasterpiece. 9/10\n"},

{"review": "\n1977 was the year that kicked off an iconic batch of stories set a long\ntime ago, in a galaxy far far away. From the dynamic mind of George\nLucas, 'Star Wars' is a monumental piece of sci-fi greatness, in which\nit is a film that all aspiring sci-fi writers and directors have looked\nat for inspiration. With a creative plot and characters that only a\ntrue imaginative mind could've created, a stage was set for much\nbeloved film trilogy.<br><br>The casting was great, I don't think anybody could ever imagine the\ncharacters introduced in this film being, acting or sounding any\ndifferent to how they do here. Leading the way is Mark Hamill as Luke\nSkywalker, closely followed by the other main protagonists Han Solo\n(Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) which led to a\nstellar cast allowing their chemistry to grow as the movie went on.\nAlso present and profound were Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anthony\nDaniels and Kenny Baker playing droids C-3PO and R2-D2 respectively,\nPeter Mayhew as Chewbacca the wookiee, and David Prowse as Darth Vader,\nvoiced by the legendary James Earl Jones.<br><br>But enough about the actors, what really makes this movie special are\nthe visuals, graphics and special effects that nobody had so\nimmaculately achieved at this point in time; the TIE fighters scenes\nand the soaring planetary landscapes must've been so breath-taking, in\nwhich case they still are today. Along with excellence in special\neffects, there is also excellence in original score-writing, in which\nmost will agree that John Williams' best work lies within this movie.<br><br>Dynamic, creative and at times very funny (mostly because of C-3PO),\nStar Wars lives as a real innovative turning-point in cinema, though\nthe emphasis on the effects and visuals almost overshadows the fact\nthat this is one of the greatest and most lovable films of all time.\n"},
{"review": "\nI think that this movie is definitely one that I am sure that at some\npoint in their lives EVERYBODY has seen.

The Star Wars Universe is one that fans of fantasy or\nSci-fi might be drawn towards (I say \"might\" for a reason that there\nare some people who don't like this). John Williams music score is\nfantastic. The acting is great, especially from James Earl Jones as\nDarth Vader, Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan\nKenobi. The other acting ranges from good to decent.<br><br>So this movie is a good one to sit down and watch for an entertaining\nnight.

{"review": "\nI saw this as a kid, and I have to say, this is a great start to the\nStar Wars franchise. Star Wars does a great job of introducing all of\nthe characters that are so important to the Star Wars films. Luke\nSkywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, and\nHan Solo. They all are great. Also it establishes the main conflict of\nthe film right off the get go. Because of how great they do of\nestablishing characters and conflict it allowed the sequels to succeed\nas well and further continue from this film.<br><br>Also the story is awesome in this film. Luke Sky-walker, a farmer,\nbecoming a Jedi knight and going on an adventure to help rescue the\nprincess. This is a great story about how someone who thought they were\nnothing becomes something that is truly needed.<br><br>The action is legendary. There is plenty of laser fire in this film and\nwho could forget the epic attack of the death star towards the end of\nthis film. Films like this show that you do not need constant action\nthrough the whole film at every part. There is great setting up of\nevents prior to much of the action taking place. This helps establish\nthe conflict and allows for the audience to understand the situation\nand why the action must take place.<br><br>Music is awesome as well. Star Wars always had the best music of any\nfilm. However Star Wars does not have nearly as good of Music as \"The\nEmpire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\".

{"review": "\nJust an opinion. Star Wars.

The death of Darth Maul may\nhave been the scene of more thriller saga, and even had blood. I say\nthis tongue in cheek, but of course shocking scenes of thriller genre\nare not part of Star War, and should not do. The complexity of the\nlifestyle of a Jedi is a portrait of a disciplined good nature. The\nStar Wars universe has no doubt, makes sure the existence of force and\nit is proved in all the skills displayed by the knights, it has the\nForce not as a god, but as something that connects everyone and made\nthem everything. The trips are simple in hyperspace! I think George\nLucas portrayed much our world in Star Wars, however left the dark side\nof the force less obscure than ours.\n"},

The\nother day I watched Avatar, and at the end, when the dragon-like\ncreature flies off into the sunset, its wings formed an X and I said,\n\"oh hey, they totally ripped that off star wars.\" The\nsave-someone-by-flying-in-from-above from seemingly nowhere move came\nfrom Star Wars and the Millennium Falcon, the list is endless. The\nwhole idea of \"the force\" has been re-manifested in so many ways,\navatar being a recent example, again. The more I think about it, the\nmore groundbreaking this movie was.<br><br>And I haven't even gotten to the special effects breakthroughs, which\nis what the movie was known for at the time. I'm not really an expert\non that stuff but suffice to say Star Wars had the best special effects\nby far of any movie at the time it came out.<br><br>The Acting was terrific, and though the sequels were almost as\nastounding, they couldn't quite match the first one. A truly special\nfilm that every person should see before they die.\n"},

Its Star Wars, if you are one of\nthose uptight snobs who haven't seen then check out it, it will blow\nyour mind and make you feel young again. It will remind you will people\nlove films. Without Star Wars there would be Alien, Terminator, Indiana\nJones, ID4, Matrix, Avatar and about 75% of the movies that are still\npopular today. It is the beginning of the modern age of film making. It\nhas aged well and even though Lucas sorta botched Han shots first, he\ndid a good job of fixing some of the errors of the special effects for\nthe time.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen George Lucas was writing Star Wars he certainly had the force with\nhim, a truly inspiring force that led to the greatest masterpiece of\nall times. For many this movie may be thought as another good vs evil\nsci fi movie, however this is not the case, Star Wars changed the\ncourse of film history,it gave a whole different meaning to the word\nsci-fi, enchanting visuals, great costumes, great plot and great\nacting. The actors were like they were born to play these roles, Marc\nHamill as Luke Skywalker, the heroic kid that has never met his\nparents, loses his aunt and uncle yet with the help of Obi-Wan, played\namazingly by Alec Guiness, he starts his journey to fight against the\ndark side, together with his friends, Harisson Ford who perfectly fits\ninto the shoes of the arrogant captain Han Solo and Carrie Fisher who\nplays the beautiful and decisive princess Lea. I am 18 and it's really\nashame because i listen to my friends etc talking about star wars and\nconsidering it a piece of crap, it's really ashame because those as\nmany other people judge because of the new trilogy, however the\noriginal sw trilogy deserves everyones respect because we are talking\nabout an epic, people say that the story is nothing new and they have\nseen a similar one many times, however think just think of how original\nthis movie was back in 1977, it was a turning point in history. I\nbelieve that all true movie lovers should watch the original trilogy\nbefore daring to judge this cinematic colossus that has lived its mark\nin the history of movies. We all owe respect and appreciation to Lucas\nand all the people that helped for this movie to be made and for young\npeople like myself and millions of others to be talking for it even\nthree decades later.\n"},
{"review": "\nGood clean fun. This movie didn't ask you to think about any deep and\nweighty subject matter. It was good vs. evil almost literally in black\nand white. And when you left the theater, you didn't have to digest\nwhat you had just seen. To top it off, it reached out and grabbed you\nin the opening scenes with a fantastic shot of two ships in space doing\nbattle. Even the bar scene was believably because the weird characters\nwere not computer generated. They were played by real people in\ncostume, and the viewer knew it and could live with that.<br><br>It was clear at the end that Darth Vader had escaped the destruction of\nthe Death Star, but it was unclear how the small, one-man fighter he\nwas in could have traveled far enough on its own to be rescued.\n"},
{"review": "\nTo this day, all of the original 3 (4 thru 6) still excite me to no\nend. I was surfing the satellite TV selections and came across the\nbeginning of the move.

Granted, if you want to be one of the\nfirst to see a film... you know what I'm getting at.<br><br>Star Wars, and all of it's later incarnations, are masterpieces from\nMr. Lucas that can never be denied in their place of glory in American\ncinema.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's difficult to look at this film without offering the comparisons of\nEmpire and Jedi. Sure they had much bigger budgets and a more intricate\nplot in the case of Empire. But Star Wars must be viewed for what it\nwas intended as, the opening of a whole new world. As a cynical 33 year\nold I watched Star Wars for the first time in years and thoroughly\nenjoyed it. It's true that some of the dialogue is stupid, the effects\na little shaky and even the acting (Hammil's especially) is wooden in\nplaces. But film is craft and to imagine one mans vision crafted it is\namazing. It could have been terrible, it could have been a stinker but\nhe put a team together that to me, pulled off miracles. The story is\nnot original, it's a composite of every fantasy adventure written but\nit makes for a dazzling spectacle. John Williams, the man who made Jaws\nthe tension filled thriller it is, scores a dramatic, fan fare opening.\nIt's as if he knows how important this film is. I have to love it. More\naccessible than Lord Of The Rings and a pure piece of pop history. Star\nWars is not the greatest film ever made, but it's certainly an\nimportant one\n"},
{"review": "\nI seem to remember that many years ago George Lucas admitted that the\nbasic core idea for the movie was wholly derived from the Seven\nSamurai. Just as the Magnificent Seven had lifted that plot and\nre-located it from Japan into Mexico, so Lucas took the very same idea\nand re-located it into Outer Space. Count the heroes: Obi Wan, Luke\nSkywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3PO. Seven,\nright? And they have to take on the whole menacing force threatening a\nnice, peaceful civilisation and restore order and justice. Which of\ncourse they do. OK, that basic plot is hugely embellished and adorned\nwith highly impressive special effects (even now they still look\ngreat), but at the heart of it the original Star Wars film is\nessentially a hi-tech sci-fi re-telling of the Seven Samurai. BTW, I\nstill can't bring myself to think of it as anything other than Star\nWars, \"in brackets the first one\". How can it be Episode IV when it was\nthe first one to be conceived? Is Lucas ashamed to admit he's just\nmilking his cash cow? Or ashamed to admit he's not really done anything\nelse of note outside of the Star Wars franchise? As for earlier\ncomments about this movie having changed the world - or even just the\nworld of cinema - all I can say is get real, get a life and get out\nmore. It's a couple of hours of entertaining fantasy, and not all that\noriginal at that.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is the first star wars movie that earned ambitious George Lucas an\nOscar nomination, and millions of dollars. This was the launch to\nvarious sequels , toys, games and defined the star wars mythology like\nno other. I have to give it to Lucas, the story is amazing. The\ncreativity is awesome, the excitement is average (because the special\neffects in recent movies have more zest) but nonetheless it will still\nhave it's place in the history of great movies. Luke Skywalker lives\nwith his boring uncle Owen who aspires for Luke to continue the family\ntradition of being a farmer and to take care of their land when he\npasses away. But Ben Kenobi, an old \"hermit\" opens Luke's eyes for\nsomething more adventurous. He helps Luke go on an amazingly stellar\njourney to rescue a tough princess from the bad but likably powerful\nDarth Vader. To get there, he meets the cocky but handsome spaceship\npilot Han Solo and his hairy buddy Chewy. Also, bringing in the humor\nare two smart-ass pieces of machinery, C-3P0 and R2D2.\n"},
{"review": "\nLately, I have been writing reviews on some of my favourite movies when\nI realized I had not reviewed or even seen Star Wars in great some\ntime.<br><br>Star Wars is very fast moving with great acting performances, lines and\nthe feel that the people enjoyed what they were doing.

This is another great example of a movie that has not\nbeen expected to do well in cinemas but has anyway. Out of the few\npeople who have not seen this, or there has been a large gap since your\nlast view, you should immediately go and get your hands on a copy of\nthis fantastic movie.<br><br>Overall, this movie is a service to all great movies.

{"review": "\nThis is the movie that probably changed sci-fi and fantasy films of the\ncinema, full of action, imagination, nostalgia, character development\nand charm.

{"review": "\nYes, the original can still stand head and shoulders above the\ncompetition. One of the all-time biggest box office titans, the first\nfilm in the original STAR WARS trilogy is a 24-karat film classic in\nthe same vein of such cinematic masterpieces as The WIZARD OF OZ (1939)\nand CASABLANCE (1942). Even the decades of sequels, lame knock-offs,\nand crass commercial tie-ins cannot dim the sheer brilliance of the\nultimate space opera. When re-watching the film all these years later,\nit remains impossible not to get caught up once again in the film's\nirresistible sense of adventure and excitement.<br><br>Much of what makes the film special (and what director/writer seems to\nhave forgotten when creating his uneven prequel trilogy in the\nlate-nineties/early-2000's) is the relative simplicity of the entire\nproject. This is not to deny the various technical merits of the film,\nas Lucas is a true pioneer in large-scale effects-heavy film-making.\nThe still-impressive special effects designed by Jonh Dysktra and John\nStears set a new standard for film visual effects, and the production\ndesign and Rick Baker's make-up effects are top-notch without being\noverdone. Impressive as the film's technical merits remain, however,\nthe film's true heart lies in good old fashioned story-telling.<br><br>In the end, STAR WARS excels as entertainment simply because it is a\ngreat story told in an fresh and inventive manner. The characters have\nall justifiably become pop culture icons, especially Mark Hamill's\nquintessential put-on hero Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford's quick-witted\npilot Han Solo, and everyone's favorite bickering robots, C-P3O and\nR2-D2. The perfect amount of sophistication is brought to the\nproceedings by screen legend Alec Guinness, who delivers a performance\nof great nuance and indisputable class. Best of all is the infamous\nDarth Vader (sinisterly voiced by James Earl Jones), who remains one of\nthe silver screen's greatest villains.\n"},

Luke Skywalker came\nto be a childhood hero for me. The magnificent score by John Williams\nonly hightens it's brilliance. <br><br>This movie for me is the best of the trilogy and I'm sure will stand\nthe test of time as with all great movies.

{"review": "\n\nStar Wars is the stuff of legends, mainly because it finds its inspiration\nin countless folk legends and archetypes, but also because it became the\ninspiration of an era. It was probably the first ever cinematic cult\nphenomenon and one can measure its power by the sway it still holds 27 years\nafter its release.<br><br>The story couldn't be simpler frankly so do dwell on this detail would be to\nmiss the point entirely. The backdrop is the main character of the film and\nit is nothing short of miraculous! The alien vistas and locals while\notherworldly have a worn look that makes them unbelievably real (unlike the\noften fake-looking CGI of the prequels). The technology looks real. This\nauthentic look gives the action scenes a power almost transcendental. It\nsurpasses anything we've ever seen because despite it's otherworldlyness it\nall works. So the world Lucas creates more than makes up for the bland\ncharacterizations (these are only archetypes after all so don't expect too\nmuch depth, that's a advantage Empire Strikes Back has over the entire saga)\nand acting, although veterans Alec Guiness, Peter Cushing and James Earl\nJones give this more dignity and weight and there's a very welcome cynical\n\"this can't be real\" look from Ford that means the film doesn't take itself\nall too seriously (something lacking in the prequels).<br><br>This vision of fantasy has it's flaws but it still solidly deserves cult\nstatus for it's gargantuan strengths: a legendary score by John Williams,\nera-defining special effects, a mythology and fantasy that rival anything\never imagined by a film-maker, great action and a pure naive heart that\nmakes it impossible to resist and is seriously lacking in today's\nblockbusters.<br><br>Star Wars is more than a film: it is in itself a reason to love movies.
