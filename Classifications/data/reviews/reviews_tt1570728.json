{"review": "\nMy initial reaction is that this film is the best romantic comedy that\nI've seen in years. The genre has been pretty devoid of quality lately.\nSo, I don't know if that plays a part or not and I really don't care at\nthis point. I enjoyed everything about this movie. It has tremendous\nheart and charisma and it's so very easy to get caught up in to the\nlives of these characters. A certain degree of patience is required\nwhile viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary\nto the story are worth getting to know. Steve Carell's character is the\none everyone empathizes with and when the movie shifts away from the\n\"A\" story you wonder why and start to think that the \"B\" story is going\nto be muddled or clich\u00e9 or one to endure. Well, they're not and\neverything comes together in a wonderful fashion. The entire cast here\nis perfection. The overall message may be one to debate but it doesn't\nmatter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so well\ndone.\n"},
{"review": "\nYou know usually I'm not into romantic comedies, as I find that most of\nthem fall short &amp; are extremely cheesy. I really liked this movie\nthough. One of the great things about it, is the acting is great.\nEveryone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel for\nthem in their individual situations. Usually when I think of Steve\nCarell, I think of a jokester. He was great in his serious scenes\nthough, very believable. And Ryan Gosling, Oh my goodness, Ryan\nGosling. He has always been one of my favorite actors. He plays a\nladies man in this movie, trying to get Carell back on his feet after\nsplitting with his wife. The two of them have great chemistry together\nand provide plenty of laughs, along with touching moments. I just saw\nthis movie yesterday and I already want to see it again. That almost\nnever happens that I want to see a movie again right away. Very cute.\nThis movie has a little bit of everything and I think that most people\nwould enjoy it. 9/10!\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this expecting an amusing, albeit predictable, movie. Boy was I\npleasantly surprised! <br><br>Steve Carell plays a man, Cal, blindsided by his wife's sudden request\nfor a divorce. While wallowing in self pity at the local bar, Jacob\n(Ryan Gossling) decides to turn him into a project, and introduce him\nto the wonderful world of womanizing.....But you've seen that from the\npreviews right? What comes next is a great look at love, from first\ncrushes to long term marriage.<br><br>This movie is the perfect blend of funny and sweet (the entire theatre\nwas laughing throughout). Great performances from the whole cast,\nincluding a surprisingly refreshing change for Steve Carell. The\nwriting was perfect, the pacing was great.... A perfect date movie! Not\noverly sappy and not typical \"chick flick\" drivel.\n"},
{"review": "\nI will admit from opening bell, that I do enjoy sappy love movies. It\nwas a movie that made you laugh,cry,wonder and cover your eyes. Steve\nkeeps true to his on screen character and his own real life strength\nbut never forgetting to mumble some sort of funny line even in his most\n\"sappy-est\" of moments. I give this movie two thumbs up for its twist\nat the end and keeping it out of viewers sights so well! I do however\nwish that they would have developed a little more back story with\nRyan's character but still, a movie to be enjoyed by all. Emma delivers\nsome nice side humor along with her friend in the movie as well! I\nbelieve Steve may have surpassed expectations of his ability to play\nthat main love role and still maintain his \"funny guy\" image.\n"},
{"review": "\nI wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie at the theater,but I am\nreally glad I did. The characters are well played out, not very likable\nat first, but after you get to know the cast, you really feel for\neveryone. I thought Julianne Moore &amp; Steve Carrell had great chemistry\nwith their relationship. Super script, nice directing, great casting\nwith Robbie, the son. This movie will surprise you at how good it is. I\nloved how you saw the characters at work, at home, at the bar &amp; with\ntheir friends. This was very well played out &amp; comes together in the\nend extremely well. Ryan Gosling is very hot even when he is sleazy.\nGreat date night movie!!\n"},
{"review": "\nI feel compelled to write as I can't believe the rating this movie has.\nWe've seen it all before many times and this movie brings nothing new.\nOK let me begin, the first 40 minutes are funny, if it ended there it\nwould be 10, Carrell &amp; Gosling give good performances and really gel as\na duo but like so many comedies it loses it's way and the mid section\ndrags only to find that the finale is a big sentimental schmaltz that\nreally shouldn't be present in a comedy. Why do American comedies\nalways do this (Sandler, Carrey)? It's better than Just go with it, it\ncouldn't be any worse!, and the performances are all first rate, it's\njust a pity the project is wanting.\n"},

{"review": "\nThere is a moment (or two), where the movie is close to lose its way or\nget off its track. But it's only a momentary thing that will go away\nalmost instantly.

It is rare\nthat a romantic comedy can be as good as this.<br><br>And while other movies try to up the ante on raunchiness, this one\nalmost goes the opposite direction and does a great job in doing so.\nWith Carell, Gosling, Stone, Moore and Tomei you have excellent actors\nwho can convey almost anything, if the material is right.

{"review": "\nOverall this is a terrible romantic comedy. But jokes and acting\ncarries you through.<br><br>The plot is really stupid, and at times very unpleasant. Some will\nobject to the underage sex angle, some to the stalking, some to the\nwomanizing. What I found most grating was the idea of a sex-class\nsystem, where a girl should date someone not on her class level. And\nthe story hinges on a girl dumping a guy for not realizing he is not on\nher level.<br><br>On the plus side though, the acting is mostly solid, and there are a\nlot of really funny moments scattered about.

The script relies on a basic story, but well developed,\ndynamic, without overlong passages; the dialogues are well written with\na good dose of humor.

The\nwhole Steve Carrol and Ryan Gosling character relationship and\ndevelopment was a hoot. This is probably Steve Carrol's best movie to\ndate and thanks in no small part to Gosling. Carrol is more or less in\na reprieve of his usual character, but the script helps uplift him.\nThereare unfortunately the occasional almost forced scenes of\nsentimentality too that feel mis-placed. Especially a lot of the\nDad-to-Son talks, and wife and husband talk - which I patiently waited\nthrough as the heavy-handedness of those scenes would abate.

{"review": "\nThis is a very funny movie, but it also has serious content. We see two\ncharacters, who represent two kinds of \"crazy, stupid love.\" Jacob is\nconstantly picking up girls at bars, taking them back to his apartment,\nand having sex with them. This is shown as a silly way of living when\nhe finally meets a girl who ridicules his tactics. On the other hand,\nCal has been in a marriage for 25 years and considers himself to have\nfound his soul mate. But there seems to be no basis for why he should\nbe together with his wife - they just reminisce and talk to fill the\nempty space. There are several scenes in the movie where the idea of a\n\"soul mate\" is made to sound incredibly silly. So if both these kinds\nof love are silly, where are we left to go? Is there any kind of love\nthat is not silly? Perhaps the relationship between Jacob and the girl\nwho ridicules him shows some way forward. They both seem to be happy,\nat least.

{"review": "\n**No Worries, No Spoilers** Crazy, Stupid, Love is a perfect title for\nthis movie! It's all about love obviously, and how it can vary between\ngender and ages. In the beginning, I thought it was funny, but was kind\nof wondering where it was going. Well, if you go to watch it, don't\nworry about it, because the end shows all the connections in a\nhilarious way. It has to be one of the best endings to a movie that\nI've seen in a while. Steve Carell is a great actor and shows his\nsofter, sad side, but does it in a quirky, funny way. Ryan Gosling also\nplays his character to perfection! It's a fun, light-hearted movie,\nwith an outstanding cast. I would and have recommended it to friends!\nWorth your money just for the ending and to see Ryan Gosling with out a\nshirt!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis was strangely one of the best films I have seen in recent years. I\nwent into it expecting it to be just another \"chick flick\". I came out\nwith almost completely the opposite feelings. First off, what a stellar\ncast in this movie! Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma\nStone, and Marisa Tomei?! I was expecting it to be very similar to \"Dan\nin Real Life\" (a disappointing watch). Crazy, Stupid, Love incorporated\nall the elements of what a romantic comedy should be. The name itself\nis enough to summarize the story. Ryan Gosling portrayed a very\ndifferent role that we know him to be; an unhappy, rich-boy who has an\nepiphany and meets the right girl. His normal role is one who starts\nout happy or sad, and just dives deeper down the rabbit hole (Stay,\nDrive, U.S. of Leland, etc.). Crazy, Stupid, Love was an incredible\nmovie that evoked numerous emotions out of me (which is hard to do) and\nwould probably everyone else who gives it a shot.\n"},
{"review": "\nMajor let down. I watched this movie enticed by the stellar cast. I\nthought \"how bad can it be?\". Turns out it can be pretty bad. The only\nbright point is some funny moments close to the end of the movie. I\nfind it annoying that it tries to be profound, but actually doesn't say\nanything that hasn't be said before about love, relationships, divorce. <br><br>Ryan Gosling is very convincing in the beginning of the movie and the\nphotoshop line that Emma Stone utters is one of the best I have ever\nheard. The son is pretty good as is the babysitter, but the \"lead\"\nactors, aka the married couple, never convinced me that they were\nstruggling with their marriage.\n"},
{"review": "\nI loved this movie. It was funny, sweet, heartfelt and showed character\ngrowth and maturity. I love Steve Carell and he does an amazing job as\nper usual. Ryan Gosling's character's transformation was amazing.\nJulianne Moore's character did a great job showing the difficulties and\nhow confusing love and marriage can be sometimes. Emma Stone was sweet,\nfunny, cute and did a great job. The young son of Steve Carell was\nheartfelt, adorable and really added to the movie. The ending actually\nsurprised me, not sure if it was just me but I am never usually\nsurprised in romantic comedies. Nothing too sappy, nothing too\ninappropriate or raunchy. The movie was almost 2 hours long but did not\nfeel like it. For a large cast they pulled all the characters together\nvery well. The character's stories are realistic making it a great\nmovie. Not a chick flick just for women, Gosling and Carell's\ncharacter's relationship is funny for all. This is a great movie for\nanyone to watch and portrays how crazy people really are when they are\nin love.\n"},
{"review": "\nWell i saw Crazy, Stupid, Love wasn't expecting much but this movie is\nso funny. I always had liked Steve Carell for his funny acts but in\nthis movie his funny and emotional both and i really like it. Ryan\nGosling at its best. I didn't liked much his Drive movie but in this he\nis awesome, cool and funny too. Emma Stone the cute and cuddly though\nsexy has given good performance. Jonah Bobo as Steve Carell's son in\nthis has his own issues of love.<br><br>This movie is related among some characters who are tit-tat related to\neach other. One of the ending scene is seriously funny.<br><br>You should definitely watch it.......\n"},

The Office lost its\nsteam once he left, he is someone who can carry an entire cast, he is\nthat good! <br><br>And Ryan Gosling, he was quite good in Drive, and he does it again\nhere. I think we have another huge actor coming up here and we will be\nseeing him in a 'lot' of movies for the next 20 years.<br><br>Emma Stone (Easy A), another excellent performance.<br><br>The entire cast is good.<br><br>This is one heck of a stylish movie, very well directed and\nchoreographed.

{"review": "\nA surprising movie on many levels. Sassy humor mixed with grounding\nreality.

Yes, there is crude humor--it seems to come with the\nterritory in Steve Carell movies--but that is not the basis for what\nmakes this movie great. Nor is it \"great\" in the sense that I expect it\nto land a bunch of award nominations. But if you're looking for a movie\nthat mimics life, but presents it in an entertaining way, you'll\nprobably enjoy this one.

{"review": "\nRealistic in its unpolished perspective towards love and uniquely\nentertaining in its raw, disorganized humor, \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\"\nstrays far from being a regurgitation of all other artificially sweet\nromantic comedies by a considerable amount. As predicted, Steve Carell\nadds his one-of-a-kind, awkwardly amusing touch that goes so well in\npractically any comedy, this one not being an exception. Steve Carell's\ngoofy attractiveness, conjugated with the more gallant and serious mien\ndemonstrated by Ryan Gosling adds a pleasantly balanced overall mood to\nthe film. \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\", unlike most others in its category,\ncenters its focus on both the blissful side and utterly disgruntled and\nhavoc-filled side as well, such an encompassing approach is what yields\nthe positive differential that sets it apart and incorporates an added\nlevel of excitement.\n"},
