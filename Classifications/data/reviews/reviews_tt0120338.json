IF you\nmissed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss.  The rest\nof us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think.  I am a\nthirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this\none stands in its own entity, in my book.  It was not supposed to be a\ndocumentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night.\nIt is the most amazing love story ever attempted.  I know that it is the\ncynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on.\nSomeone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How\nlame is that?  It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the\nplanet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.  I will gladly side with\nthe majority this time around.\nOkay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am\ndone.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nFirstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go\n see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor. \n Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame\n script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and\n the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I\n actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time\n they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them. \n But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me\n tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates\n was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine\n like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo &amp; Juliet).  But ultimately,\n the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He\n didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it\n crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third\n class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they\n were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that\n point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels\n of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and\n the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie. \n Very impressive job.\n"},

His portrayl of Cal was so evil\nthat despite being an awful person, you couldn't help but feel sorry for\nhim, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much.<br><br>James Horner's music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he\nworks on to the ultimate level.<br><br>Kathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few\nof the laughs of the film. <br><br>Everything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were pure\nmagic.<br><br>This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Century\nand one that will never be forgotten.\n"},
{"review": "\nJames Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, \"you\neither love it or hate it\", I for one love this film, yes I know it's\ngot a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the\n3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional\nand beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was\none of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and\nvisually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the\nBritish original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close\ncontender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic\nis a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and\nLeo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film\nnowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made\nalongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is\ndefinitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully\namazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's\neyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting\nscore that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply\nperfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop\nversion. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully\nspectacular film that will live on.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's a crying freaking shame that this outstanding movie's rating has\nbeen dragged down by small people who hate it because it was\nsuccessful. You should be ashamed of yourselves. <br><br>When I first saw it I thought it was the perfect movie, and it's still\none of my favorites 8 years later. It's got sexual tension, action,\nsocial commentary, and the acting doesn't suck. It's even got Bill\nPaxton, one of my top 10 criteria for a great movie. What's so horrible\nabout it that it deserves an aggregate 6.9? The only reason I can think\nof is this perverse habit people have of hating anything that makes so\nmuch money or is otherwise successful that it makes them doubt their\nown worth. That's just sad, and you shouldn't take it out on an\ninnocent blockbuster.\n"},
{"review": "\nThirteen years after Titanic launched and all it takes is the first few\nbars of that haunting music to transport me back to my first time\nwatching the movie in the theater.

I bought the books, read the history\nbooks and found myself immersed in all things Titanic.<br><br>I didn't hurt that my great, great aunt was on the ship and survived.\nIt makes it a little personal for me. In fact, I happen to own one of\nthe only objects in existence that came off of the ship into a lifeboat\nand did not go into the water.<br><br>Love the movie - it still is #1 in my book.\n"},
{"review": "\nI've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of\nkids, 14 to 22 put on the DVD of \"Titanic\" on a fantastic state of the\nart mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them had\nactually seen it before. But they all had seen the moment of Kate, Leo\nand Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the\nwhole movie. Shortly after the epic started, they started to get\nrestless, some of them left asking the others -- \"call us when the\niceberg appears\" Over an hour and a half into the movie, only the two\ngirls who had seen the movie before, were still there. They started\nshouting: iceberg, iceberg. A stampede followed, they all came back to\nsee the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed, emitting Ohs and\nfar outs. So, just like I thought when the movie first burst into the\nscene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing\nto sink but what about the rest of the of it. Dr. Zivagho, for\ninstance, had a similar running time, but think how much takes place in\nthat film within the same period of time. In \"Titanic\" Leo teaches Kate\nhow to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the, supposedly, creme de\nla creme in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at the\nhistorical details, if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that\nthey have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to\nsink. The real sinking here is of film standards. All the efforts are\nfocus on special effects and opening week ends. The film went on to\nbecome the highest grossing movie of all time so, what do I know?\n"},

I was completely wrong on\nthat. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever\nwill see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by\nthe end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where\nthe orchestra played \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" and the end when all\nthose perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack.\nThis movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over\nagain.\n"},

{"review": "\nTitanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy\nwho has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but\nthis movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. <br><br>We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?)\nbut the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence,\nassurances of it being \"unsinkable\" - tease the audience, almost to the\npoint where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'<br><br>I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about\nthe characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time\nto introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful,\neven beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First\nOfficer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when\nyou see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total\nchaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take\nher to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish\nmother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The\nviolinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage.\nAnd the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at\nthe end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled\nher promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met\nanyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.<br><br>Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great\nacting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic,\nenduring film.

The\ncharacter's interactions and emotions about the situations and\nconflicts they were faced with were also depicted well. Leonardo\nDiCaprio (one of my favorite actors) and Kate Winslet play amazing\nroles as Jack and Rose, and they do it justice! The connection and\nrelationship between the two is a story in itself within the film as\nwell as the ship's tragedy.<br><br>As a young girl I watched this movie many many times with my\ngrandmother.

Its plot\nis\nun-original (boy meets girl, falls in love, than heartbreak), its script is\nun-original and its acting is mediocre.

{"review": "\nTitanic is my all-time favorite film. This film breathed life back into\nthe Hollywood epic. Sadly, many people don't see it as an epic. They\nsee it as a romantic chick flick that only focuses on the love story.\nBut contrary to popular belief, the film focuses just as much on the\nship as it does on the love story. It blends fact and fiction so well\nin a way that you rarely ever see on film. Movies like this are very\neasy to make, but there's very hard to make well and almost impossible\nto make great. It is also probably the most emotional moving film I've\never seen. It's the only movie that made me genuinely cry. It also has\none of the important life morals: only life is priceless and making\neach day count. Although, I do have to admit that the dialogue is\npredictable and at times stilted.

{"review": "\nJames Cameron creates a head spinning tale of romance and despair with\nthe characters of Jack and Rose and the tragedy of the Titanic sinking.\nThis movie is still captivating people everywhere over 15 years after\nits original release. <br><br>If one is searching for a solely historical account of the Titanic\nsinking, then this is not the movie for them. While tying in key\nhistorical elements, Cameron has stated that Titanic was not meant to\nbe a historical account but a love story. He does a wonderful job of\ncombining the tragedy of the sinking and the story of forbidden lovers,\nbut some historical events are not included. For example, many\nreviewers ask why Cameron did not include the Californinan shutting of\nits radio for the night. This scene was in fact filmed but then cut due\nto Cameron feeling that \"If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a\nmicrocosm for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be\nself contained.\" <br><br>However, if you are looking for a beautiful, heart wrenching love story\nwith a historical setting, this is the movie for you. You can't help\nbut to be swept up in the elegance of the period. The costumes and sets\nare lavish for the upper class and realistically drab for those of the\nlower class. The dialogue is excellent, seamlessly creating a beautiful\nstory line. The special effects used along with gorgeous camera work\nproduce shots upon shots of heart stopping images. Winslet and DiCaprio\nhave undeniable chemistry and are extremely convincing in their roles\nof wealthy and poor, respectively.<br><br>Overall, this film is a must see classic for people of all ages.

{"review": "\nThis is going to be a short review for Titanic.<br><br>Plot: The plot of the film is really amazing. If you want a three-hour\nlong love story, this is the movie for you. Another movie worth\nwatching is \"A Walk to Remember\", starring Mandy Moore and it is a\nmovie that I have seen and it is spectacular. The entire 196-minute\npicture centers around two lovers: one rich girl named Rose DeWitt\nBukater and poor artist Jack Dawson (portrayed nicely by Kate Winslet\nand Leonardo DiCaprio) as members of different social classes who fall\nin love aboard the ship during it's ill-fated maiden voyage.<br><br>Characters and Story: James Cameron wrote a story that shines out, but\nthe dialogue is very clich\u00e9d and cheesy in a few areas.

James Cameron wanted to make a\nmovie about the Titanic and it shows, with it's $200 million dollar\nbudget and he made this movie historically accurate as possible. The\nship's sinking scene is one of the coolest thing they could do with CGI\nand practical effects and it is awesome.<br><br>Sound / Music: The music is awesome and fantastic.

So why did Cameron opt to give\nthese\nREAL people bit parts and invent two shallow characters? <br><br>Good acting and high production values go a long way to cover up a poor\nscript, and Titanic is proof of that with the Oscar frenzy that surrounded\nit (However, it was the first film in a long time that did not earn a\nscreenplay nomination and won best picture).  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate\nWinslet both did excellent jobs acting as did Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates.\n They all deserved an Oscar in light of what they had to work with on the\npage.  How conventional, shallow and contrived does this sound?  Rose is in\nwhat is for all intents and purposes an arranged marriage, but she is really\na free spirit ready to fly away from her upper-class roots.  If it wasn't\nfor her darn mother.  Now to make this issue even more clear, her fiance is\ncontrolling and abusive.  The decision is clear.  She has to fall for Jack,\na fellow free spirit who shows her real love.  Alas, Jack must be\nsymbolically sacrificed so she can avoid being drowned in her life and truly\nfind freedom in the new land.  Not only are the mechanics of the script\nclear, but the story is old and tired.  Titanic works because it plays on\nstereotypical conventions and latent emotions; it does not earn its\nemotional climax on its own merit.

{"review": "\n\nTitanic is a fairly good movie, but I personally think the historical part\nof the movie seemed to be more touching and overall better then the love\nstory between Jack and Rose. Their relationship seemed to have all of the\naspects that every Hollywood romantic-fantasy has: the two young lovers are\nbreaking the social code to be seeing each other, they're both young enough\nto pass as teenagers..(which, in this film, I think they are) , there is a\nsteamy scene, and it has a touch of tragedy. Well, it's all very predictable\nbut James Cameron did a wonderful job with the story of the ship Titanic. I\nfound that part more touching and realistic than the love story. You really\ncan see the passenger's terror and panic during the sinking sequence. Its\nall very saddening to watch because, as you watch it, you know that it\nactually happened many years ago. The amount of detail put into it was\nincredible, from the \"woman and children first, first class first\" to the\nmusicians staying aboard to play, the fireworks... all very nice to watch.\n\n"},

I did not care about any of the\npassengers James Cameron took the time to introduce us to.  In fact, we know\nnone of the true heart-breaking tales of the R.M.S.

We already know many fools clamored around the graves of\nanyone known as Jack Dawson.

{"review": "\nBest version since the old \"A Night to Remember\" (1953). With all those\nreviews, I only need to \"touch\" on the synopsis of the film. 101\nyear-old \"Rose\", long thought to have died in the disaster, reappears\nas the wreck is examined and it's contents rescued yet again. The\n\"explorer-scavenger\" is fascinated both with the story and romance of\nit all, but especially the recovery of the romantic 58 Caret\nheart-shaped diamond necklace known as \"The Heart of the Sea\" which is\nworth more than the Hope Diamond. Did such a gem exist, or is it the\nproduct of the screenwriter's vivid imagination? It is a well-told tale\nand the time passes so fast that it doesn't seem like a 3 hour movie at\nall. Superb cinematography combined with seamlessly beautiful special\neffects and the best shipwreck ever filmed. Models and the CGI are most\nconvincing. The Oscar-winning musical score and audio are amazing. The\nships motors and interior looks entirely authentic. Kathy Bates has a\nwonderful \"minor\" role as the \"Unsinkable\" Molly Brown, and, as MGM\nused to say, \"a cast of \"more stars than there are in Heaven\". Billy\nZane plays the deliciously mean and arrogant fianc\u00e9e of 17-year-old\n\"Rose\",who is being forced to have pre-nupual sex, and marry a man she\ndoes not love, for his money. She hates it and is almost driven to\nsuicide. One nude scene of a beautiful woman-child will offend only a\nminority of the viewing audience. (Rated PG-13. Also a few choice swear\nwords.) Best ending ever (warning-huge spoiler) as \"Rose\" slips the\nhuge blue diamond into the sea. The original DVD is letterboxed and not\n\"anamorphic\". Buy a later version, which is remastered for 16x9 TV. It\nis remastered to 1.78 format. I like to stop it around chapter 18 for\nan \"intermission\". <br><br>I also highly recommend seeing \"Titanic-The Artifact Exhibit\" as a\nroadshow or Las Vegas attraction.\n"},

To tell the\ntruth, I wasn't really interested in another adaptation of the tragedy\nof the Titanic, either. The movie was over-hyped and overpriced, so I\nthought I'd give it a pass, but I finally gave in to peer pressure. I\nleft the theatre raving about the movie myself.<br><br>It has remained one of my all-time favourites to this day. Titanic is a\ntrue masterpiece that combines a great real-life story with an equally\nheartbreaking imaginary one and has such visual grandeur and emotional\ndepth that very few movies have managed to bring to the screen. It\ndeserved every single Oscar it was given (save for the score, which is,\nfrankly, a shameless and unimaginative rip-off of Enya's music) and it\nshould have been awarded more. It is a shame that Kate Winslet's,\nLeonardo DiCaprio's and Gloria Stuart's stunning performances were\nshunned.<br><br>It is very sad that since then it has become fashionable to dismiss the\nmovie as a 'corny, boring melodrama', because it is anything but.\nTitanic is an impeccably written and directed, wonderfully acted and\n(from a technical point of view) superbly realised, timeless\nmasterpiece.

The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in\nparticular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's\nmother.

Especially for a 90s film! Some scenes were just\nnot necessary, like the scenes which the old gran was telling the\nstory. Why can't it all be set back in 1912?<br><br>Overall it is a fantastic film, and definitely worth seeing!<br><br>My score is a 9.3/10\n"},
{"review": "\nRarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so\nwonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that\ntranspired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved\nand the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the\ninfamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten,\ndisplays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. <br><br>From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with\nits enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio\nand Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and\ndemonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad.\nThroughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins\nwith Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack\ntirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an\nunderstatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like,\nand is far from your generic love movie. <br><br>I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing\nits numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will\ncertainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I\nrecommend for anyone and everyone to see.\n"},
{"review": "\n'Titanic' is my favourite film for many reasons. 1. It has Leo DiCaprio\n(hottie!)in it ;-D 2. It is one of the most romantic love stories ever\nmade 3. It is the one of the only films that has ever made me laugh and\ncry. 4. It touches your heart more than you'd ever want to admit. <br><br>A lot of people dismiss this film, saying it's got rubbish acting,\nuninspired directing, overlong, whatever. I can guarantee that none of\nthese things are true. Titanic truly is a masterpiece, a landmark in\nthe history of film. I first saw this film last year. I'd heard about\nhow good it was, but thought it might be a little disappointing. But\nhonestly it was breathtaking. I won't say anymore, just go watch it.\nWatch. It. It is one of the best movies you will ever see. Maybe even\nthe best. And be sure to watch it on it's re-release in 3-D in April\n2012.\n"},
{"review": "\nOne of the well-known ships that became an disaster at sea was the\nTitanic. It sank in 1912 on its voyage out to sea. Disaster struck when\nthe ship hits an iceberg and cause it to sink. The passengers of the\nTitanic were trying to survive. Many of them died. Some of them were in\nlifeboats. Now, James Cameron brings back the mighty ship. In his film\nTitanic, a man named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He goes\non the Titanic after winning an poker game. Also on board an beautiful\npassenger, played by Kate Winslet and her fianc\u00e9, played by Billy Zane.\nDiCaprio and Winslet fall for each other in love as the Titanic\nventures out to sea. Then, the iceberg hits the Titanic and that is\nwhen chaos begins. Passengers are frightened as the ship slowly starts\nto sink. The ship's sinking isn't about the passengers screaming and\npanicking, but it gives an realistic dramatization of the ship. Real\ndocumentary footage of the real Titanic appear on the opening credits.\nWinslet's character Rose, now old, is played by Gloria Stuart, who\nremembered what happen that night. The movie's visionary of the Titanic\nsinking is wonderful made with the special effects. As for Winslet and\nDiCaprio, they have great performances as Rose and Jack. The film\nitself is a tragedy of what happened. Titanic is one of the best films\nof 1997. An great, true Hollywood Epic. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 4 stars.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film never sinks. From the opening few shots to the final moments\nof the film, everything about it is simply wonderful. It's majestic,\ncharming, sweet, thrilling, suspenseful and most of all heart\nwrenching. The pacing of the film is perfect and the special effects\ntowards the end of the film are also top notch. The story is about two\nyoung lovers Jack and Rose. It really is a beautiful love story as we\nsee them overcoming the odds in order to be together. But don't be put\noff by the love story element, as there's plenty of action and\nexcitement come the second half of the film and the film never sinks\nfor one moment. Like I said, the pacing is perfect and I must say this\nis probably the greatest story telling ever put to celluloid - James\nCamerons a genius. <br><br>All the actors/actresses are great, but for me it's Leonardo DiCaprio's\nmovie as his character Jack, demonstrates his self worth at every turn\nand goes to extraordinary lengths in order for him and Rose to be\ntogether and ultimately stay together i.e survive the catastrophe that\nmay fore-go their destinies. <br><br>To conclude, phenomenal.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have seen the movie so many times that i remember the dialouges now.\nAnd every-time i see i feel like there is something new to it. It is\nthe most amazing, wonderful movie i have ever seen. James Cameroon\ncould not have got better actors than Leonardo and Kate Winslet to this\nmovie. I have fallen in love with Jack since the first time i saw this\nmovie. Never really occurred i could write a review about it, but today\nwhen i am watching it again and had my laptop just next to me thought\nof opening my heart. The music, gosh i have never loved background\nscore of any movie as much i love Titanic's. The band that plays when\nship is sinking, the song my heart will go on- well nothing needs to be\nsaid about that. I have been fantasizing this kind of love and romance\never since i saw this movie. It is one grand movie ever made, you\ncannot not like even a single part of this one. I really want Titanic\nto have a sequel in which Jack would come alive somehow with some logic\nor something. This movie took my heart away, its astoundingly beautiful\nand mesmerizing. Jack Dawson is my love and Titanic will remain my\nfavorite movie ever.\n"},
{"review": "\nI absolutely adore this movie and i have done for years. It was only\nwhen I looked it up on the internet that I realized many people don't\nlike it, which was news to me as everyone Iv spoken to about it loved\nit. It seems people on internet forums etc. think that by slating\nTitanic they will look ''cool'' and look like their ''in the know''\nabout films. Ha, please don't make me laugh. Slating Titanic and\ncalling it 'the worst film ever' (which Iv seen many people call it)\njust makes you look absolutely clueless. This is a brilliant film and I\nwould highly recommend it. Watch it for yourself and don't let ''movie\nbuffs'' comments sway your own opinion.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am breathless and out of words for THIS film. No, its not the best\nfilm I've seen, but it certainly comes close to being.

This film is pure art and will never\nbe forgotten. It is filled with extravaganza effects, worthy\nperformances, and a simply adorable soundtrack.<br><br>Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances in his career. He\nis simply perfect as Jack; simple, yet humanized. Kate Winslet is even\nbetter, playing Rose with Gratitude, courage, and efficiency. This is\nalso, simply her best performance in her career.<br><br>Effects are simply breathtaking. James Cameron provides with stuff that\nyou would have never seen in the 90s. As for his direction, also\nbenefits because of his stretchy camera angles and glorious sights.\nThis is seriously Cameron at his BEST and there's nothing more\nwonderful than that.<br><br>Small things like soundtracks don't usually matter in films, but this\nfilm has the best I have heard in my life! Racy, touching, and\nemotional; there isn't anything like it.<br><br>Overall, I have no words for Titanic. Almost everything is near-perfect\nin this timeless classic. It is also an unforgettable cinematic\nexperience; as well as a benchmark in history for visual effects.

{"review": "\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are young lovers on the doomed\n\"Titanic\" in this 1997 film directed, written, and edited by James\nCameron.

The entire time I\nwatched it, I kept thinking of the people on the planes and in the\nWorld Trade Center on 9/11.<br><br>There have been several films about the Titanic but none so lovingly\nrecreated and so powerful emotionally. Kate Winslet is exquisite as\nRose, the upper class young woman engaged to a brute (Zane), who falls\nin love with third class passenger Jack Dawson (DiCaprio).

And I don't care\nif you say its too depressing to watch. I watched it a second time and\nI cried just as much as I did as the first time. And you know what, it\nwas great. If you have a girlfriend/wife, and if neither or one of you\nhasn't seen it, go see it together. She will cry (maybe) but you will\nget laid. How do I know this; experience.

{"review": "\n\nI personally found the movie to be extremely well\ndone from a technical perspective, meaning: \neffects, sound, camera work, etc.  However, I felt\nthat the acting was forced--the accents being some\nof the worst I've heard since Costner tried his \nhand at Robin Hood--and the script was atrocious--more\nresembling the banter of modern high school students \nthan what I would expect out of an early 20th \ncentury debutante and orphaned pauper.  Cameron may \nbe an exceptional director, but he's no writer.  <br><br>Of course there are many that would disagree, \nbut I think that most of this movie's more staunch \ndefenders have simply allowed themselves to be lulled \ninto complacency by the stunning visuals and the \n\"feel-good\" love story.  I admit that the movie\ndoes evoke a warm and fuzzy feeling if you allow \nyourself some suspension of disbelief, but for\nthe pickier among us (we like to think of \nourselves as having a more \"discerning\" or \"refined\" \nsense of taste) it simply fell short of being a \n\"great\" movie.  <br><br>I personally found the circumstances of the \"love \nstory\" between Jack and Rose to be exceptionally \ncontrived.  How did Jack manage to get himself from \nbeing a poor orphan in the Midwest, to a starving \nartist in Europe?  How convenient for him that \nRose was a being forced into an unwanted marriage \nto \"save her family\" thus providing him a \nperfect opportunity into her pants...err..heart...  \nThe bottom line is that this particular love story \nwould have been fine in a less pretentious movie, \nbut this was a 200 million dollar reenactment of \na horrible tragedy brought about by hubris, \"God\nhimself couldn't sink this ship,\" and exacerbated \nby classism.  Not exactly the proper venue for an \nexposition on teenage rebelliousness and hormones...\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nToo bad about the cheesy special effects- at least the storyline and\nacting\nwere good. I firmly believe this film winning best film is the most unjust\noccurrence at the academy awards, along with CITIZEN KANE not winning best\npicture, and Marlon Brando for best actor in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. The\nscreenplay and the acting are the most important aspects of any film, and\nsince Titanic was deficient in both areas it should not have received the\nhonour of best film. Granted, the special effects are wonderous and should\nbe honoured, but as a whole the film was not a masterpiece, it did not\ninspire, and they took far too long to die. There were far better films in\n1997, due to their superior screenplay and acting talent, but they were\nsnubbed because of this. It really makes one question the credibility of\nthe\nacademy. \n"},
{"review": "\n\n  I admit I enjoyed this film.  The grandeur of it all was impressive.  The\nfact that James Cameron let this film get to a 200 million dollar budget is\nalso very impressive.  However, once the grandeur is taken away there really\nisn't much left.  The plot is a simple romance.  And since the story is so\npredictable, it puts some heavy pressure on a three hour\nfilm.<br><br>  The direction is superb.  My distaste for this film doesn't extend to\nJames Cameron's technical direction.  His technical direction is on par with\nSpielberg's.  However, his human/emotional part of that mix doesn't rate\nvery well.  The acting also is not consistent.  I didn't find DiCaprio's\nperformance bad, but his character seemed to be very easy to play and wasn't\nthat complicated.  Winslet, who's performance in Heavenly Creatures stunned\nme, is mainly okay here.  The best performances belonged to Gloria Stuart\nand Kathy Bates.<br><br>  The score also rates with the best, and the soundtrack is one I highly\nrecommend.<br><br>  In the end, I think this film is more comparable to \"Cleopatra\" than to\n\"Gone With Wind\".  The budget and the problems making the film end up being\nmore interesting and more entertaining than the film itself.<br><br>  Did this film deserve best picture? No.  But it's nomination was also like\n\"Cleopatra's\" nomination.  The big budget and the absolute vastness of the\nfilm was enough.  \n"},
{"review": "\n\nI liked \"Titanic\". Its a good old fashioned adventure/romance/epic with a\nstrong storyline and definable characters. Sure the tacked on romance is as\nstock as the characters, but that is still better than the alternative\nserved up by most modern movies: ie--no plot and no characterization at\nall.\nThe thing that bothers me about this version of the Titanic sinking is that\nwriter/director Cameron takes full credit for the screenplay, when so much\nof it was directly lifted from a 1958 film about the event, \"A Night to\nRemember\" (also a book, and a previous film).\nAnd I'm not talking about the fact the Titanic sunk, or any of the other\nfactual details of the story--obviously those will be the same. I'm talking\nabout virtually identical scenes, events, and dialogue that could not be\ngathered from public record.\nScenes such as the ship's builder standing alone in the tilted ballroom,\nlooking at the painting on the wall as the ship goes down. Or the rich ship\ncorporation a**hole being told that yes, his ship is going to sink, no\nmatter what he says. Or identical scenes of the steerage rabble breaking\nthrough the gates. These scenes, and many others, are mounted and shot in\nso\nsimilar a fashion to the previous film, with such similar dialog, that I\nbelieve they cross the border into plagerism.\nRent the 1958 version of \"A Night to Remember\", watch it, and tell me I'm\nwrong.\n\n"},
