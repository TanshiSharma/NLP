{"review": "\n\nThank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the\nfilm!!\nMost reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much\nabout the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid\ncinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br><br>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater\nafter the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they\nthought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain\nteaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even\nafterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this\nyear, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br><br>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his\nshort term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now\nhe's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You\ndon't need to know anymore.<br><br>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are\nconstantly\nput into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy\nPierce.\nCarrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This\nfilm is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing,\nand especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these\ndays.  Four Stars!<br><br>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the\nmovie--you'll be thanking me later.<br><br>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too\nwill give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty\nimpressive.<br><br>\n"},
{"review": "\n\nSo the \"innovative\" concept of filming out of sequence has been cliche for\nat least a few years now, but here's a film that makes it work far better\nthan its been shown in a while.<br><br>Having read the reviews and talked to others who saw it, I thought that I'd\ngo into the movie figuring everything out right away and declaring the\nconcept unworkable.  I couldn't be further from the truth.  This movie does\nthings to your head that are illegal in some countries.  Portrayed (for all\nintents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that\nour lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than\nusual) does.  Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember\nanything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped\nand killed his wife.  Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before\njumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered\nin the same way.<br><br>Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great\nperformances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and\nrevolting.<br><br>Overall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I'm still\nnot sure.  This film noir concept shouldn't work, but it does so\nwonderfully.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nA man with no short term memory tries to solve a murder.  The scenes in the\nmovie are played in reverse.  Sounds like yet another run of the mill comedy\nbut in reality is one of the best suspense/dramas I've seen in\nyears.<br><br>While some may claim showing the scenes in reverse is just an annoying trick\nto make a simple plot confusing and add a plethora of twists, I\nwholeheartedly disagree.  Any good story teller knows it's not what you say,\nbut how you say it.<br><br>By playing the scenes in reverse you experience the confusion Lenny\nundergoes throughout the film.  Showing some of the scenes in chronological\norder (BTW, the use of B&amp;W instead of color to make the time distinction was\ningenious) creates suspense which builds as the two timelines converge.  The\nsomewhat rushed pace (compared to a written format) doesn't give you enough\ntime to adequately analyze the events during the movie.  This has two\nadvantages: firstly you're going to talk about it after you leave the\ntheater adding to experience immensely,   and secondly  you don't have time\nto think about what has happened (will happen) so you're experience better\nfollows that of Lenny.<br><br>While many might find the movie rather confusing, it flows wonderfully for\nanyone familiar with writing styles that constantly jump around a timeline\n(e.g. Catch 22).\n"},
{"review": "\n\nYes, it's true.  The entire movie is based on a gimmick.  However, I\nhonestly feel that this does not cheapen the picture in the slightest bit.\nI loved every scene; discovering information as our lead character\ndiscovered it. It demands a second and third viewing, as there are many\nsubtleties and quick flashes that may not be picked up on the first time\naround.  Its one of the most original films ever made, and for people who\nscoff at the concept of not having a short-term memory, it actually is a\nreal condition. Watch this movie. And, please pay attention. The\nperformances are wonderful, and its structured magnificently.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nIf you hate reality-based film-making this is awful. If you hate Film Noir,\nthis is ugly. But for me, Nolan has convinced me he is one of the most\nimportant directors out there. I was even thinking, \"It must be easy to edit\na movie so that it's all backwards.\" But it's not, it's not any easier - and\nhe leaves you straining and watching from scene to scene, searching for the\ntruth. Even the final revelation will affect each viewer and leaves them\nsearching for their own \"ultimate truth\" according to their own experience.<br><br>Most people comment about manipulation in connection with this movie, but\nafter watching the last scene, I'm convinced that manipulation is not the\nmain theme at all.\nI don't want to spoil it for you, but the basis of unfolding backwards in\ntime is that you are enlisted to scrutinize the film trying to discover some\nset of motivations behind each character's actions later in time that makes\nsense. If you think you would enjoy this sort of puzzle, I think you will\nenjoy this excellently crafted film.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nIncredible, riveting and powerful.  What else could I say?  This movie has\nall of the qualities of classic film noir as well as the magnitude of an\noriginal, unique concept that has been tried and tired before but works\nhere.  <br><br>Guy Pearce has been underrated for years (just think back now to Priscilla\nand can you believe this is the same guy) and finally might get the\nrecognition here that was at least well-deserved of him back for LA\nConfidential.

{"review": "\n\nI saw \"Memento\" in the early afternoon, a fact for which I am thankful. \nWhy?  Because it then proceeded to dominate the majority of my thoughts for\nthe rest of the day.

Then I went back to bed and starting\ncontemplating \"Memento\" AGAIN.  Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, I went to\nsleep.<br><br>This is a movie that gets in your head and will not get out until you figure\nit all out.  And that can only be done with extensive internet research. \nReading \"Memento Mori\", the short story upon which the movie is \"based\"\nhelped, too.<br><br>\"Memento\" is nothing short of a phenomenon.  And a brilliant one at\nthat.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf the director of this independent film tried to make us feel really\nconfused, like the main character, he did it wonderfully. There are\nonly a few movies like this one, the kind of movies that makes you pay\nattention to every minute of it. Obviously that doesn't work all the\ntime, but this case is the exception. Really well directed with a\nwonderful photography and excellent cast. The main actors' performances\nare great. We really root for the guy as we hate the ones who try to\ntake advantage of him.<br><br>Original films like this one always stand out. Perhaps it didn't caught\nmuch attention at first but now it is in an important position at the\nIMDb top 250 and that means that most the people recognize great movies\nwhen they see them.<br><br>As I said before, this movie is a little confusing because it runs\nbackwards while the black and white scenes run in chronological order.\nBut that wasn't a cheap trick to make the movie more \"intelectual\", it\nwas its strength. A rare film that shouldn't be missed.\n"},
{"review": "\nBefore I rant on the absurdity of Memento being currently ranked #14 on\nthe Top 250 list, I'll say what I liked about it. Yes, it was an\nextremely entertaining, original and well-done all around film. The\nacting was first rate, the story decent, and the film makers did a\ngreat job putting it all together.<br><br>However, I may be crazy, and I'm sure the \"film snobs\" will grit their\nteeth at this, but at the end of the day, isn't Memento just a gimmick?\nA water cooler novelty? I mean, basically they took a slightly above\naverage plot and did something new, and granted inventive, by editing\nthe film structure in reverse. For the most part, the movie is pretty\nmuch shown from end to beginning. Yes, they did enough to make things\nmake sense in between, but essentially it was an exercise in \"hey,\nlet's make a movie, and then edit it so everyone will talk about that\nreverse movie\".<br><br>I don't care what anyone says. That's the bottom line, period. I've\ntalked with plenty of fellow movie buffs who I consider to be\nreasonably intelligent, and some are even the snob-types mentioned\nabove. And none of us can figure out what all the fuss is about. Maybe\nwe ain't that smart.<br><br>I hate to get into comparisons, because it's difficult to compare\ndifferent types of movies. But be honest, if you can tell me with a\nstraight face that Memento is an overall better film than \"Apocalypse\nNow\", \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Goodfellas\", \"Fight Club\",\n\"Jaws\", \"Chinatown\", \"Raiders of The Lost Ark\", \"American Beauty\",\n\"Silence of the Lambs\" and a large chunk of the other 230 films ranked\nbelow it, than you just need to sit back, take a deep breath, reel in\nthat massive \"I'm a nonconformist art-house movie aficionado\" thing and\nget a reality check. It was a good movie, but it wasn't that good.\n"},

Go\nout and rent it. Go and watch it. Go out and buy it. you will not be\ndisappointed. This movie is about a guy who loses his short term memory\nand tries to hunt down his wife's rapist and killer.

{"review": "\n\nAnother cleverly done example of backwards story telling, from the Pulp\nFiction school..  Unlike Pulp Fiction, the backwards element got annoying\nand tiresome fast in this film.

I suppose I could get a bit\nmore out of it with repeated watchings, but I don't really care enough to\nbother with that.

{"review": "\n\nWhat I generally look for in a good movie is character development.  If\nnothing changes in the characters' personalities, I have trouble enjoying\nthe film, as it loses a certain sense of realism.  One method of character\ndevelopment that I particularly enjoy is that of the \"revealing\" method,\nfinding out more about a person's personality by being shown information. \nMany people mention The Usual Suspects when reviewing Memento and I can't\nhelp using it as well.  This method of character development is used very\nwell in that movie also, in the twist at the end.

{"review": "\nFirst time I saw this movie, I got a little confused, but, at the same\ntime, I was amazed by the director Chris Nolan's work. The history is\nso fantastic and the format of the movie is so audacious that i became\na real fan, bought the movie and watched it every day for like two\nweeks.<br><br>Nolan talks to us in the movie through the little details. The space in\nLenny's chest is one that becomes interesting in, at least, three\ndifferent moments: when he shows it to Natalie at her place, when he\nsees himself pointing at it in a Polaroid picture and in the end, when\nhe remembers his wife while going to the tattoo shop. In this last\nscene, the space appears filled with the message \"I've done it\". I\nbelieve this blank space summarizes his pointless odyssey, I mean: it\nwill always be blank, although he knows, deep inside, that it should be\nfilled with that message. It is a proof that he won't stop.<br><br>The way Lenny feels his hand aching as he speaks to Natalie (after\nbeating her), the way all people use him to their own purposes, the\nlittle details that prove that Sammy Jankins' history is his own (the\nscene with a needle that flashes his mind as he lays on Natalie's sofa\nand the talking with Teddy in the end/beginning), his deepest\nreflections about his condition (\"How am I supposed to heal if I can't\nfeel time?\" or \"I can't remember to forget you\"), all those elements\nare the ingredients for this real masterpiece. A movie that proves to\nus in a weird, yet ingenious, way how we lie to ourselves to live, how\nfar can we go to give our lives a meaning and face the awful truth.\n"},

You see things from the perspective of\nour main character who suffers from a bizarre memory loss condition.\nRather than explain the plot, I will just say that if you plan on\nwatching this movie just once, get ready to change your plans. You will\nneed to watch it twice to fully GET it. It moves too fast for the\nviewer and by the time it's over you will tell yourself that you GET\nit, but you don't.<br><br>To those who say there are no holes in this film I scoff at you.

Personally, I'd rather watch a movie that just makes sense on\nit's own and no matter what you say, this one doesn't. \"Memento\" tries\nto do what \"Pulp Fiction\" did but takes itself way too seriously. The\nviewers are treated to a narrative from the character Teddy at the end\nwhen he has to explain the situation to Leonard thus explaining the\nmovie to us.

However, it never comes together -- when you reorder the\npieces\nthere are too many glaring plot holes.  So, though it's very entertaining\nwhile your watching it, it leaves a vague sense of irritation at the\nend --\nit's a cheat.  It's keeps promising that it will eventually make sense,\nbut\nit never does.  \n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie is so wonderful conceptually that I almost feel bad about writing\na bad revue of it.  The backwards timeline to reveal memories is a very\ninteresting idea, and throughout most of the movie it is handled\nbeautifully.  Also the plot twists are all sharp and interesting, save the\nend twist which destroys any chance for catharsis on the audience's part. <br><br>But more than the ending of this movie bothered me.  Guy Pearce is a horrid\nhorrid actor.  He is able to look brooding and that's about it.  Perhaps\nwith a more skilled actor (Edward Norton would have been perfect) this movie\nmight have actually achieved some emotional power.  But Pearce is only\ncapable of looking brooding and cold.  He brings no emotional depth, which\nis why the ending didn't work because ultimately the audience doesn't care\nabout his character.  Also the writing takes a turn for the worse around the\nmiddle of the movie.  The prime example of this is Guy Pearce's incredibly\ntrite \"the bed is cold\" speech which begins with boring sensory detail and\ndelves into painfully bad rhetorical questions.  <br><br>Ultimately, this movie fails to bring a payoff to the audience.  It starts\noff as a beautiful film noir that melts into your mouth like a piece of dark\nchocolate.  but the bitter aftertaste will get you.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nMemento is an original idea in filmmaking, but it doesn't provide a\nsatisfying end.  The story builds up to a point where the audience is\nexpecting a major climax, but it never happens.  That lack of a finale makes\nthe journey much less rewarding in hindsight.  5 out of 10\nstars.\n\n"}
