{"review": "\nIt's simple. If what you want is a live-action version of the Disney\ncartoon, or a remake of those old \"Me Tarzan, you Jane\" camp fests,\nthis isn't the film for you. If you don't like the character to begin\nwith, this isn't the film for you. The vast majority of critics who\nthus far have given the movie unfavorable reviews fall into one or both\nof these two categories. It's disheartening, and it's so obvious they\ndon't really know anything about the character and don't care enough to\nlearn.<br><br>If, however, you have yearned for the day in cinema when Edgar Rice\nBurroughs' epic hero is treated with the gravitas and respect he\ndeserves, and if you enjoy epic jungle adventure with a heart, by all\nmeans GO SEE THIS MOVIE! It is phenomenally good! Think of it like you\nwould a dish of food. Let's say spiced curry. If you don't like spiced\ncurry, you won't like it no matter how well it is prepared. This movie\nis for those who enjoy spiced curry. For those who love it, this is the\nmost delicious dish you're ever likely to taste.\n"},

{"review": "\nI am really surprised at the mediocre reviews so far of this film.\nHonestly when I first heard about the film I had little interest in\nseeing it, but the trailer was better than I expected, and when has\nChristoph Waltz been anything short of terrific in every role he has\nplayed, but particularly when he is a bad guy. (Come to think of it has\nhe ever been a good guy?) The whole cast is solid, and I really liked\nthe historical setting concerning the Belgian King Leopold and his\nexploitation of the Congo. <br><br>I found all the animals and the CGI to be surprisingly cheesy.\nUndoubtedly the weakest link in the film, but that factor did not\nsubtract much from a constantly entertaining and solid story.

Trying to\nsqueeze the Tarzan legend into that narrative as well? Why not write\nyour own damn stories and leave ones like this in the past. So, we have\nevery single non-white person heroic; every single white person\npsychopathic (except Tarzan, of course. Even Hollywood can't write the\nnarrative which puts Samuel L Jackson into the actual Tarzan role.\nYet). I resent having to pay for this ludicrous propaganda. I studied\nAfrican history for my degree. Where do you think the slave trade\noriginated? Who stopped it? Yeah, go do some research and answer those\nquestions for yourself. I think at the end of this movie (I don't care\nif there are spoilers ahead; this film is THAT bad) Tarzan and Jane\nhave opted to stay in a squalid African hut to have their baby because,\nya know, who'd want a huge manor house in England with servants and\nhygiene?

{"review": "\nReally one of the top ten worst films I've seen in my life. The plot\nwas paper thin, if there was a plot at all. I knew going into this that\nit was going to be mostly about the digital gorillas, the babe, and the\nhunk. What I didn't expect was the flimsy dialogue, scenes unconnected\nto the \"plot\" and such miserable drivel coming out of the mouths of the\nactors. I was also surprised by the pseudo environmentalist doctrine\nthey weave into the plot. The babe is being taken away by the bad guys\nto her death and the only thing she can say is, \"Promise me you wont\nhurt the animals.\" Really? The best line in the movie is when the black\nguy says, \"Can we just stop this?\" My sentiments exactly. The overly\nsensitive, crying, cannibal warlord was a bit too much.\n"},
{"review": "\nI wasn't sure what to expect with Tarzan. I thought it might be cheesy\nor the special effects would look ridiculous, but surprisingly a\nmajority of the time, it looked really good!

However, I found a good chunk (about 85% IMO)\nrelied on realistic scenery, makeup and special effects. I mean...\nthey're not going to use real gorillas or lions with the actors, but\nthe CGI ones looked really good and will have you mesmerized by the\ndetail. Personally found the movie very enjoyable, action packed and\nbeautiful to watch. The director and actors did a phenomenal job. I\nfound myself glued to the screen for a majority of the film.\n"},

{"review": "\nThe core Tarzan story is not only iconic, it speaks to something deep\nwithin us. It is at the same time the ultimate Romance and the ultimate\nAction tale.

I have no doubt that after I am\ngone, producers and writers will continue to be attracted to it and\ncontinue to \"make their bones\" by bending it to their unique style.<br><br>That said, this one is not especially good. After a great opening\nscene, there is the filmic equivalent of \"dead air\" for about 35\nminutes and when the script does finally get in gear it stumbles and\nfalls, subject to a wildly disjointed narrative and equally bizarre\nediting.<br><br>Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd has been impressive in other films (a race driver,\na superhero) and I think with different material and a different\ndirector he could have connected.

This film does by far the best job of capturing the\nspirit of Burroughs' Tarzan of any film to date, particularly the idea\nof nature (English nobleman) vs. nurture (his jungle upbringing). <br><br>More importantly, The Legend of Tarzan is a terrific, engaging story,\nwith great characters and pacing and plenty of action, but not so much\nthat it seems like overkill. The story's focus and presentation has\nbeen updated from Burroughs' first 104-year-old story, as has been\nstated in write-ups and interviews. But note that the issue that draws\nTarzan back to the jungle in this film is essentially the same one that\noriginally brought his parents there, as described in the first two\npages of that first novel. <br><br>Yates and company have done a superb job of crafting a good\nold-fashioned adventure, retaining the look and feel of the Africa of a\ncentury ago, and combining it with a plot and theme that is relevant\ntoday, aided greatly by the addition of real life character George\nWashington Williams. The scenery and special effects are first rate. As\nnoted above, the spirit of Burroughs' Tarzan is beautifully captured.\nThe few detail changes from Tarzan's backstory are minor and serve to\nsupport the story. For example, Jane is more feisty than we are used to\nin previous films and in the earlier books, but in my opinion that\nmerely improves the story. A must see!\n"},

These action sequences\nreally make this a true Tarzan film. The cgi is so good. It looks\nincredibly realistic thanks to technological advances. It makes the\nanimals look so cool, and realistic it makes it hard to tell it is cgi.\nThere are a lot of brief flashbacks in this film, all of which help to\nput the story together so that everything that has happened makes\nsense. These are all quite exciting and really help the move the story\nfurther. These were a good idea for the film and I am glad they were\nadded in in different places throughout the film. The only flaw is that\nthe plot goes a bit slow at first, but it picks up quite quickly and\nall the good stuff happens. So overall, I enjoyed this film, it is a\nvery exciting, action packed adventure that you should definitely see\nbefore it is too late.\n"},

{"review": "\nI was really disappointed to see such an absolute waste of a good idea.\nThe premise was okay. \"A Tarzan remake?

(Although remakes, s***ty horror movies,\nsequels, and movies based off books seems to be all there is anymore.)\nThe problem is that they turned this idea into very poor excuse of a\nmovie.<br><br>Visuals: Visuals were great. Nothing wrong there. Scenes had good\natmosphere, lighting, and effects. Some of these beautiful scenes were\na little unnecessary but I guess they needed the run-time. <br><br>Story: Boring. Boring boring BORING. The beginning before the title of\nthe movie was shown was exciting and full of mystery in a way, but\nafter the title, things went down hill. The story started becoming more\nbland, boring, and confusing. It was hard to keep myself from falling\nasleep or sighing whenever I expected something exciting to happen but\nnothing did. Coincidences and clich\u00e9s appeared very often and just left\nme sighing and cringing.<br><br>Characters: Ugh. Tarzan is the clich\u00e9 brooding hero. Jane is just an\nannoying character. Washington Carver didn't really seem relevant? The\nothers I guess were...\"okay\"? I just wasn't feeling any joy or interest\nwatching any of these people. I don't know if that was what the writers\nwere looking for but I didn't like it. <br><br>I know this review is very broad, but I like short reviews that are to\nthe point.

{"review": "\nThe legend of Tarzan isn't the movie we were all expecting it to be. It\nis a boring film filled with way too many flashbacks and some dialog\nthat just makes no sense. My major complaint coming out of this movie\nwas it tries to be a new version of Tarzan but tries to input the\norigin of Tarzan into the film. Another major complaint is that the CGI\ncompletely sucks. The gorillas don't look real they look as if they're\nstraight out of a ps4 video game. There are two good things and that is\nMargot Robbe as Jane, now of course she is a damsel in distress but out\nof all the characters in the film she had the most well written dialog\nand another good thing is the Sam L.Jackson character. They are the two\npositive things about this film. All and All this movie is stupid and\nnot interesting by the end of the year this will be in my top 5 worst\nof the year.

All the sequences\nlook like they've been shot on a Disney world ride. The plot is\nsooooooooooo predictable and sooo boring. They basically make a joke of\nactual African tribes too.

Revenge,\nredemption, and retribution play out in a fast paced cinematic treat. <br><br>We has a true to life evil villain doing horribly bad things, we had an\nequally good historic witness interact with Tarzan and Jane to stop it.\nFilmgoers see Tarzan and Jane as a believable couple in love with each\nother.

It\nwasn't until about 75% of the way through the movie I understood what\nwas going on. The action scenes throughout the movie were intense and\nwere able to keep me entertained but I definitely would not go see this\nmovie again. <br><br>What I enjoyed most about this movie was how realistic the animals\nwere. Being that this movie was not animated I did appreciate that the\nanimals did not talk but were, actually, frightening at times.

The\ndialog is severely under-written, and the acting isn't much better.\nThere's absolutely nothing here to draw-us in and care about any of\nthese characters. And where the time-jumping helps in certain areas, it\nhurts in others. <br><br>Christolph Waltz is a fantastic actor, but not even he can do anything\nwith this dreadful script. I've only seen about 20 films from 2016, but\nthis is the early front-runner for the worst film of the year - that\nI'll see anyway. Watching the last hour was like sitting at the airport\nduring 4-5 flight delays. Just get me outta here.<br><br>If you like surfing wildebeasts it might be your bag. Margo Robbie is\ngorgeous, but her efforts here are even more futile than Megan Fox's in\nJonah Hex. Yes, even Jonah Hex is better than this Tarzan film. <br><br>I hope that saves you some time. <br><br>Tons of little problems, but the big problem is the dialog, which is\nbare as the desert, and dumb as a rock.<br><br>I would defo pass on this.<br><br>You might like this if you LOVED: peter jackson's KIng Kong,\nTranformer's Revenge of the Fallen, or Indian Jones and the Kingdom of\nCrystal Skull. And this would be the worst among those.\n"},

Or stupid? it all seemed very predictable. I did\nlike Christopher Waltz, who played his part well, even if the character\nwas just too unbelievable. Samuel L Jackson did we even need his\ncharacter in the film at all? He added nothing to it, and I do like him\nas an actor. CGI was good. But I just found the whole film, boring and\npredictable with a rubbish story line, it was a sort of non film,\nnothing much going on, Tarzan had just the one look, he had no\nexpressions whatsoever.

He finds his way back due to\ncertain events and has to save his people from greedy Beligish\ncolonizers.<br><br>I liked how the story focuses on a more worldly Tarzan who is not the\nape-man he once was. I think that, given to the right people, this\nmovie could really have been something really great, but unfortunately,\nthe movie goes astray and loses it's direction.

Samuel L.

{"review": "\nThere were 25 books written about Tarzan, and I've read them all\nseveral times. He's one of the great fictional characters of the 20th\ncentury, and many later characters were created using the basic\nframework created by Burroughs; every time you see one lone man face\nimpossible odds and win, (Bond, Eastwood westerns, Die Hard, etc.)\nyou're seeing the hero type Burroughs created. This movie is by far,\nthe best Tarzan movie ever made, and the first to depict the hero as\nBurroughs invented him. Several \"reviewers\" try to dismiss Tarzan and\nthis movie as \"racist\"; clearly, they know little or nothing about the\noriginal character. If a fictional character survives long enough, they\noften become lampooned and reduced to comic status; this doesn't mean\nthat the original character isn't great; sadly, we seem to delight in\nmarginalizing our heroes. If you want to see a well made and\nentertaining film that depicts the character as his inventor intended,\nthis is a movie you should see.

But, if you are going to make him\ncentral, give him strong content. With this i come to Tarzan, GIVE\nTARZAN SOME STRONG CONTENT. All i saw was a person mixed in a lot of\nstories, had no clue about other characters, was trying to be part of a\nlot of clan/tribe/family.

{"review": "\nBland is the only real word to describe The Legend of Tarzan. Alexander\nSkarsgard certainly looks the part and has some charisma as Tarzan but\nhe is consistently undercut by a half-cooked script. The same goes for\nMargot Robbie as Jane who's only purpose in this film is being the\ndamsel in distress. Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz are also hung\nout to dry with their one dimensional characterizations as the comic\nrelief/sidekick and mustache twirling villain, respectively. <br><br>The film is also very unfocused as it constantly shifts to flashbacks\nand present day. This can be an effective technique however in this\nfilm the flashbacks bring any momentum the film manages to get to a\nscreeching halt. The pacing of this film is the biggest issue that this\nfilm has. I was a huge fan of director David Yates' Harry Potter films,\nbut with this movie he seems unsure with the kind of movie that he\nwanted to make. To move on to a more positive note, the cinematography\nis simply gorgeous. The lush landscape of the jungle makes for some\ngreat visual moments.

{"review": "\nSome of the online photo-stills make \"The Legend of Tarzan\" look pretty\nhokey, so I was a little hesitant about paying to sit through it in the\ntheater. Having now taken the chance, I can happily say that this film\nis definitely not another feeble disappointment like 1984's\n\"Greystoke.\" Though purists may dislike the fact that it's not directly\nbased on any one of Burroughs's novels, there is still basic loyalty to\nhis Tarzan mythos, and the way it incorporates some true history\u0097King\nLeopold's exploitation of the Congo Free State, poaching of its game,\nand horrible enslavement of its natives for profit\u0097adds a great deal of\nrelevance for a modern audience.<br><br>While it's obviously intended mainly as plain old entertainment, \"The\nLegend of Tarzan\" meshes humor and heartbreak very well, and the many\naction sequences are riveting without going too far in asking us to\nsuspend disbelief. No, it doesn't all make perfect sense, but perfect\nsense can hardly be expected of a fantasy of this kind. The visuals and\nanimation are quite arresting; most of the animals look real, the one\nglaring exception being the Mangani apes. But then again, this film\nreminds us that the Manganis are NOT gorillas or chimps. As in\nBurroughs, they are a separate legendary species--a missing link of\nsome kind, perhaps? The script is generally decent even though many of\nthe lines sound more 21st than 19th century. Good acting by all the\nmajor players, but those who play the native Africans steal the show.<br><br>Some budget constraints are evident, and it's an ambitious storyline to\npack into two hours: The whole pace of the film is a bit hurried.\nRegardless, anyone who's interested in seeing another Tarzan film in\nthe first place should not be disappointed and may really love \"The\nLegend of Tarzan.\"\n"},
{"review": "\nThe story of Tarzan is more a tragedy in today's world. It is a sad\ntime where we rape nature, destroy balance and revel in our\ndestruction. When I used to read ERB's books, it did transport me to\nfantasy land. A land where everything was in harmony. In balance. In\nsync. Where the circle of life was complete. This movie, did remind me\nof our rapacious nature. It signaled the unstoppable nature of human\nappetite for destruction. But as a standalone move, it could have been\nbetter.<br><br>I read somewhere in trivia that Tarzan was a superhero. Well, not\nexactly with super powers, but definitely super human. He was supposed\nto have these extraordinary capabilities. He had been able to even\ndefeat the great apes. The story teller or the director may have wanted\nto show the vulnerable or weaker side of him, but to me that was not\nTarzan. For him to be defeated physically, his foe would have had to\nalso been subject to character development. Tarzan is a character that\nis meant to challenge our physicality. If it were intelligence, I would\ngo for, off the top of my head, 12 Angry Men, JRRT's LOTR and Peter\nJackson for imagination, Star Wars for effects. I would have really\nliked to see Tarzan fighting and winning physical fights. <br><br>At the end of the day, Tarzan won. Simply because of his brute force in\nthe sensitive universe of Africa. Not politicking. I hope the next\nstory stays in the glorious fantasy world of ERB and brings out the\nphysicality of Tarzan with a poignant touch. We don't really need\nrealism here, but brutality. I want to see magnificent fighting. I want\na contrast of nature with our modernity. I want the star of the movie\nto be Nature, her beauty and what might have been. <br><br>PS. It may have been interesting to see why Tarzan transitioned from\nnudity to loin cloth/pants!\n"},

I ended up leaving the cinema\nthinking that Alexander Skarsgard's accent was much better than I\nthought it would be and that Margot's wasn't at all half bad. I feel\nthat there should be no reason to say just how good Christoph Waltz was\nas a psychological villain. Even Alexander Skarsgard, who would have to\nbe my favourite actors at the moment, was out shined in certain scenes\nby Djimon Hounsou. That man(Djimon)is one of the most heartfelt and\nunderrated actors I've ever seen, he can move from so many emotions so\nquickly and can make you feel for his characters with the smallest\nchange. (See Blood Diamond) To conclude, it's easy to assume that by\nreviews from critics that this film might be a flop, but without\ngetting your hopes up I can safely say that it has a solid story line\nand has no direct relation to the 1999 cartoon, but rather the Edgar\nRice Burroughs novels.

Though while it's plot may be far from original,\nthat doesn't deteriorate the film from being fun and exciting even when\nit gets dark, suspenseful and energetically adventurous. The pacing\nwasn't all too much of a problem for me, as the flashbacks used were to\nre-establish some of the well known details about the character (How is\nit any different to the way it was used for Batman or Superman for that\nmatter). The only thing I found to be off-putting was the overuse of\nCGI for almost 'all of the animals' present in the film, and don't\ndeteriorate from the entertainment factor of this film. For one it's\ndefinitely one of the better 'Tarzan' films made to date, a little more\nrespectable adaptation of the character than Disney's 1999 film, John\nDerek's horrible 1981 film and that 2013 motion capture crapfest for\nthat matter. Finally, the performances from the cast are great,\ndefinitely couldn't of picked a better cast for such a picture. If\nyou'd like to take a different look at the character of Tarzan and are\ncurious to see an entertaining and adventurous re- rendition of the\ncharacter, this film will definitely be worth your time.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had to tell you all about one of the surprise fantastic films of the\nsummer. I must agree that \"The Legend of Tarzan\" was an action-packed,\nscenic epic with great character actors and a dramatic musical score.\nThe story has Tarzan (portrayed by an amazingly swelt, Alexander\nSkarsgard - AKA Eric from TrueBlood) Margot Robbie is a spitfire Jane,\nand Christoph Waltz is fantastic as the bad guy. The film starts with a\ncivilized Tarzan, already a part of high society, who is asked by\nSamuel L Jackson (also a great addition to the cast) to return to the\njungle for a special mission. The mission is exciting, and the animal\nspecial effects are the best I've seen. (and yes - animals and humans\nmeet their demise, but neither are innocent of wrongdoing and all are\ncreated by CGI) Now this was a great summer movie! (as apposed to the\ndisappointing Independence Day -Resurgence)In fact, I thought it was\none of the best epic films in many years.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe plot of the classic adventure tale has been reconfigured and \"The\nLegend of Tarzan\" is unexpectedly entertaining. The story is simple\nenough as the Tarzan fights slave traders to rescue his kidnapped wife,\nin a full of special effects jungle adventure. Unfortunately David\nYates with the mix between present day and flashbacks, can easily\ndisorientate the viewer, but the fans of \"The Jungle Book\" should enjoy\n\"The Legend of Tarzan\". It has the same type of computer generated\nanimals and a dark, exotic jungle that makes boys act like men.\nAlexander Skarsgard is uninteresting as Tarzan and altogether, \"The\nLegend of Tarzan\"may look great and try to take itself seriously, but\nit's really just a popcorn movie. Treated as such, it's plenty of fun.\nnikisreviews.com\n"},
{"review": "\nAn excruciating attack against common sense. <br><br>Stupid plot, boring dialogues, clich\u00e9s everywhere; was there anything\ngood in this movie that I have missed?<br><br>Did the director lost his minds or something? Did they all smoke pot\nwhile creating this? Did anyone watch this movie before releasing it?<br><br>The purpose of art is to help viewers to experience their emotions:\n\"Tarzan\" showed me how embarrassment really feels.<br><br>Do yourself an favor: when someone lures you into seeing this file,\njust run and never look back. <br><br>I still wonder who have it 10/10? Were they paid for this? Should't\nIMDb check whether they are legit?\n"},
{"review": "\nIt took me a couple of minutes to realize \u0096 this is one of the movies I\nwill tell my children to not spill their time on. I cannot place it in\na category- it is not a historical movie- it is not near by fantasy\u0097\nSci\u0096fi? No way- but I could live with that- What it is killing my joy\nis a terrible script and a poor acting- there is no bloody reason for\nan admitted aristocrat to go back to the place he will never belonged\nto! And the accent and the love story????? ! I am not a huge fun of\nTarzan at all, but I have expected at least something better than a\nDisney interpretation. It is way worth. The script is lame. I feel\nnothing between the main actors or any figures of the movie at all. BAD\nBAD movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Legend of Tarzan is the epic version of Burroughs' story. Many\nscenes are similar to the opening scene in \"King Kong\", with mist and\namazing scenery and savage tribes to bring back a mysterious past of\nlittle known areas of our planet. The movie makes justice to the raw\nbeauty of the African continent. The script cleverly weaves in\nhistorical facts little known about the destructive control of the\nEuropean imperial powers over the African continent. Even though at\ntimes the computer generated imagery and action becomes obvious, if you\nlet yourself carried on by the story you will end up with a wonderful\nsensory experience rich in amazing imagery and epic music.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have been a fan of Tarzan since childhood when I read the stories in\nthose Whitman Book editions. While I was a big fan of the Ron Ely TV\nseries, I never felt that the Tarzan movies ever captured the essence\nof the iconic character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs.<br><br>Until now!<br><br>What a wonderful film filled with adventure, romance, and morality that\nworks on so many levels.<br><br>Kudos to director David Yates and his team for doing such a marvelous\njob of distilling ERB's vision in such an exciting and entertaining\nway. <br><br>Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd reminds me of Ron Ely and Margot Robbie joins\nMaureen O'Sullivan as the ultimate Jane. Samuel L. Jackson and\nChristoph Waltz provide outstanding support.<br><br>I cannot praise this film enough.\n"},
{"review": "\nGood story, backed by appealing visual effects, impressive direction\nand solid performance - what more did you expect from \"The Legend of\nTarzan\"..and guys, you are missing the point, the 1st half of the story\nportrayed a civilized John Clayton who initially refused to go back to\nthe wild as Tarzan. As the story unfolded, John did visit Congo on an\ninvitation (from King Solomon) orchestrated by a mercenary (Capt Leon\nRom) hired by King Solomon who was exploiting the Congolese people and\nthe rich mineral resources of Congo. The true intention was to trade\nTarzan off to an enemy Tribal leader (his son was killed by Tarzan) and\nget precious diamonds in return, to fund the King's Army. Tarzan\nhowever believed in his instinct and went to Congo to see for himself,\nthe wrath brought upon by King Solomon on his tribesmen and Congolese\npeople. The story takes an interesting turn when Capt Leon abducts\nTarzan's wife Zane as a compensation (also as a hostage) after his\nfutile attempt to capture John aka Tarzan. The rest of the movie\nreveals how John Clayton transforms himself into his wild avatar Tarzan\nand rescues his wife and eventually saves Congo from slavery and\ntyranny imposed by King Solomon. A must watch !!\n"},
{"review": "\nI loved it. The story line was well done. The Chemistry between the\nactors was dead on. Samuel L Jackson brought his quirky quick wit to\nhis role which as usual was awesome. Christoph Waltz doesn't matter\nwhat role he plays he is always awesome in it. Margot Robbie was not\njust beautiful but gave her role a real personality that the role of\nJane has not had in past movies. Alexander Skarsgard, being a fan of\nTrue Blood whom I was in love with the character Eric Northman, fell in\nlove with him even more he did a fantastic job as giving Tarzan a more\nreal like personality. The Chemistry between Robbie and Skarsgard was\nscorching. I was very impressed. Great movie it is a must see!\n"},
{"review": "\nDefinitely worth seeing on the big screen. <br><br>Special effects were believable and the acting was very good. Alexander\nSkarsg\u00e5rd was a perfect choice for Tarzan! His range of being an\narticulate English Lord to a fighting powerhouse of fury was totally\nbelievable. Margot Robbie did well as Jane, but I think a lot of\nactresses could have played that part with equal skill. Christoph Waltz\nis so good at playing the evil villain because I think that is the only\nrole he ever plays. And of course Samuel L. Jackson (who is always\nterrific) as George Washington Williams (who was a real life person\ntrue to the character in the movie). The story was different than the\nnormal Tarzan stories so that was a plus too. I would highly recommend\nwatching it.\n"},
{"review": "\nTarzan was flawless in breathtaking IMAX 3D. The acting was spot on\nthis was one of the best action films I have seen the whole year so\nfar. If you are going to see this movie you will need to see this in\nIMAX 3D. Your family will enjoy this new take on a legend of all time\nbeing. Jane was as gorgeous as ever and she will also be Harleyquin in\nSuicide Squad. This was the best Tarzan since the original actor back\nthen this movie was flawless I loved ever second of this triumph movie\nthat will be a classic in the IMAX 3D vult the IMAX 3D team should be\nproud of how the results came in the IMAX 3D format. IMAX 3D rocks the\nmovies and it shows in this movie it was great I loved it and I hope u\nlike it as much as j did the best part of this movie was the acting\nyour kids will love the action acting and expect ally the IMAX 3D\n"},
{"review": "\nTarzan is not as bad as some critics/reviewers would make you believe\nin their writings.<br><br>Tarzan (like Jungle Book) is a very good action/adventure movie that\nyou could take the family to see. Today's critics raze it because there\nis no F-bombs floating around, no nudity, no excessive blood and no\ncussing. It is refreshing to see an action movie that holds to the\nideals of the movies of my younger years.<br><br>The good: the scenery is fantastic. The jungle comes alive and it does\nnot overshadow the film or the performances. The CGI animals look\nwonderful and the interactions with Tarzan are very well done. The\naction is filmed nicely and the film has very good action scenes\nwithout having to utilize ridiculous feats of prowess.<br><br>The bad: there is not much that would be considered bad in this film.\nThe beginning is a bit bland, but it sets up the story. The acting is\nnot top notch, but it is sufficient to the film and to the setting. I\nactually thought that the film could have been longer and had more\ncharacterization in it, but that is the only negative that I had seen.<br><br>I have seen so many Tarzan movies and most were complete bombs. I had\nexpected this movie to be as bad as Greystoke, but I was pleasantly\nsurprised. I was very entertained and will be adding this movie to my\ncollection when it comes to Bluray.<br><br>Recommended.\n"},
{"review": "\nWe just saw The Legend of Tarzan in Imax 3d. Both the story and the\nproduction are amazing. The sound is very detailed without being\nobtrusive, especially the gorilla vocals, and the Tarzan yell is\nawesome. The 3d picture is the clearest and most realistic 3d I have\never seen. Having seen all the Tarzan movies going back to the old\nJohnny Weismuller Tarzan movies - I can say that this new version takes\nthe story into a much deeper and darker zone than ever before. I can't\ngo into more detail without dropping a spoiler. Alexander Skarsgard is\na great brooding Tarzan with attitude. Chris Weitz is truly evil.\nMargot Robbie is gorgeous. And the African animals are awesome. Check\nit out.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis was fantastic. I was shocked with some of the scenes because they\nwere so real to life. Although I saw Tarzan as a child in the 50's on\nT.V. with Johnny Wiesmuller and Jock Mahoney, this was so clear and so\nreal it looked like a million megapixels because of the clarity. I did\nnot like the character in the white suit. I wanted to put my fist in\nhis face myself. Saw him before with Brad Pitt in WW-II movie as an SS\ncolonel (\"Inglorious Bastards\" and I hated him there too. Jane was\nbeautiful and next to Tarzan they would make a nice couple in real\nlife. Loved the movie and it was so real and beautiful that I intend to\nbuy the DVD for my collection. Highly Recommended. 10 stars!!!!!!\n"}
