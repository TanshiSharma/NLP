{"review": "\nHow can so many people get this this movie wrong, especially the\ncritics? The high point of the film is the performance by Emelia\nClarke. She is hair-brained, and scatty, completely adorable and\nwonderful.The camera-work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second to\nnone.<br><br>Lou (Emilia Clarke) gets a job as a carer to a man (William) who is\nparalyzed more or less from the neck down. A budding friendship/romance\ndevelops; and this is 90% a feel good movie.<br><br>The criticism of the movie that it depicts a life with profound\ndisability as almost worthless is completely mistaken. The movie\ndepicts William's life as worthwhile and precious. It is William's own\njudgment that his life cannot go on as it is, and that he would prefer\nto die.<br><br>With regard to this, the movie does tend to downplay the pain and\nsuffering that William experiences. Instead it focuses on the good\ntimes and precious moments he spends will Lou. And as already stated,\nthe character of Lou is completely adorable. I am in love.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film is getting mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. A very\nbittersweet film that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same\ntime. I never read the book that which this film is based on. But\nsometimes movies are never has detailed has the books they are based\non.<br><br>A beautifully well made story, it about Louisa(Emilia Clarke) a 26 year\nold who finds a job taking care of Will(Sam Claflin) a young\nbillionaire who is permanently confined to wheel chair after an\naccident two years earlier, the use of his arms and legs are gone. At\nfirst Will does not want Louisia there, and she does her best to put up\nwith him. But soon the form quite a friendship, she teaches him to\nenjoy life again, and he shows her to be adventurous in life. But the\nquestion is will this last? <br><br>I like the chemistry between Claflin and Clarke, at no point it feels\nforced. I really bought the affection they feel for one another. At\ntimes Clarkes performance feels overly cartoonish, but still good in\nmost of it. Claflin is believable, and the question is how would you\nfeel if you where in his shoes. I don't care what the critics say, this\nwas a perfectly well made bittersweet film.\n"},
{"review": "\nI admit that I have read the book and so when the movie came out, I\njust HAD to go see it. So I drag my poor husband and we went to watch a\nlate show that was relatively full. I didn't tell him anything about\nthe movie and I watched him watching it. He actually really enjoyed it.\nThe movie was lovely. The movie itself was beautiful. The scenery was\nset somewhere is rural England. There are green pastures, a castle and\nbeautiful stone walkways. <br><br>We first meet Lou, a beautiful,charming, bubbly girly girl who is a\nstrong character but maybe a little too comfortable with her current\nlife and then we have Will. Dashing Will! Sarcastic, funny, a little\nmean at first. They are world apart but through fate ( and Will\ndisabilities) they met and slowly realize what one possessed, the other\nneeds. Even if they never really knew it. <br><br>As the movie progress, they falls for each other and we all fall for\nthem. I loved Emily as Lou and Sam as Will. They played their roles\nperfectly and the chemistry between then was undeniable. I think\neveryone should go and watch this movie if you love romantic comedy. It\nis hilarious at times and yet sweet. I assure you that you'll feel\nevery emotion out there with this movie. It's so beautiful. <br><br>Go watch it and judge yourself. For me, this is an amazingly beautiful\nlove story.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie really was adorable! I knew exactly what to expect since I\nread the book, but I loved the adaptation. <br><br>What helps the movie most is that the novelist, Jojo Moyees, wrote her\nown screenplay. She did a great job transitioning the story from paper\nto screen. Little things that were left out of the novel weren't really\nneeded to move the story along. <br><br>Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafin were excellent. Her facial\nexpressions were amazing and her insane eyebrows deserve some type of\naward all on their own. <br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack as well.<br><br>Don't listen to critics and go see this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nEmelia Clarke's work on Game of Thrones is the only reason I watched\nthis movie in the first place. She is occasionally transcendent in that\nrole, where she must keep her eyebrows restrained, and I wanted to see\nwhat would happen if her amazingly mobile brows were set free ... free\nas her dragons.<br><br>There are a lot of solid things about this movie. The story (of a young\nwoman who cares for a quadriplegic young man) is strong, the direction\nand cinematography good though not exceptional, the screen writing also\ngood-not-exceptional, the supporting cast (especially Janet McTeer and\nCharles Dance)and leading man (Sam C.) quite good, and the emotional\nnotes it hits, though all predictable and often a bit overwrought (cue\nswelling, heartwarming music...), ring true enough for an unabashed\nromance.<br><br>So, not really my type of movie. But I am happy to say that I was\n(almost) completely taken by Clarke's performance. Her character here\nis nothing like her GoT role, but is in many ways an equally\nfantasy-based role (but with clumsy shyness and striped leggings\ninstead of fireproof skin and dragons) -- and Clarke manages to pull\nthis character out of romantic fantasy into believability as\neffectively as she brings to life her role as Mother of Dragons. She\nhas the combination of charisma, physical beauty, character-acting\nchops, and inner luminosity to pull a fairly nice, 7-of-10 heartwarmer\nup to a 9-of-10 charmer.\n"},
{"review": "\nDon't get me wrong. I like a weepy, romantic chick-flick as much as the\nnext guy. But this one is so manipulative and over-the-top that I felt\nmyself getting hostile about a third the way through. It took\nself-control not to make rude comments at the screen.<br><br>Part of the problem is Emilia Clarke. He character is modeled after the\nBrigit Jones style of self-consciously, klutzy, heart on her sleeve\nheroine that holds appeal to many viewers. Clarke's acting is filled\nwith so many facial tics it almost becomes unintentionally comic. If\nyou shaved Ms. Clarke's eyebrows, she'd convey no emotional range. But\nwith them, she'd be a natural silent movie actress. Her eyebrows\nliterally stole every scene they were in.<br><br>The music, especially the segments used between scenes goes beyond\nintrusive. It is downright offensive. If a character is about to die\nand is falling in love, do we really need an overwrought vocalist\nsinging \"Oh poor me, I'm falling in love, yet I'm about to die.\" This\nis like a Greek chorus with one eye on the AM playlist. I'm\nexaggerating here, but the point is real. We don't need treacly vocal\nmusic to mimic what we've just seen. Most of us got it the first time.\nYou need a break between scenes? Instrumental segues would work just\nfine, thank you.<br><br>I've given this a \"2\" out of 10. In every way this big budget film\ndeserves a rock bottom \"1\" for its manipulative and overdone approach.\nI've given it the extra point for the lovely location shooting. At\nleast the castles don't have eyebrows.\n"},
{"review": "\nI loved this movie. It stayed very true to the book and I love the\nbook. I think Emilia Clarke was born to play her. I feel like she was\njust playing herself cause she has a personality like that in real\nlife. It was pure joy to watch her play Lou. The expressions she makes,\nthe way she talks and most of all, her amazing clothes! I loved every\nsingle outfit she wore. This film made me laugh and it made me very\nemotional, just like the book. I think Sam Claflin was also born to\nplay Will. They had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film and\nthe rest of the cast is also spot on. There are of course some parts\nfrom the book that were left out but nonetheless, this film was still\namazing. I also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie is\namazing as well.\n"},

{"review": "\nAt times I feel that humanity has forgotten, or never really knew, what\nit is to really love someone. Jojo Moyes obviously isn't one of those\npeople. Love isn't the lust we feel at the beginning of a relationship.\nIt's not the thoughtful vision we compile of what the future could be\nlike or how compatible we are. It's not about how financially\nsuccessful a prospective partner is. It's certainly not all about sex,\nalthough it would be hard to come to this conclusion when the media\ngenerally plays strongly to that idea. It's the undeniable,\noverwhelming pull from our hearts that grows only when we really let\nourselves care about someone unselfishly. <br><br>Thank you Jojo for playing this out so beautifully. Thank you Emelia\nand Sam for either knowing this experience or fabulously, convincingly\nportraying it on screen. This movie is a treat to watch and a glimpse\nof what it feels like to be a person who lives their life with a moral\nconscience, an open mind, a respect for beliefs that are different than\nyours and a desire to see the best in the world. <br><br>I feel absolutely cleansed of negativity after watching this and my\nhope for the world is renewed.

{"review": "\nOnce again, Emilia Clarke does not disappoint. The acting truly was\nbrilliant. Both on her part and on Sam Claflins part. The film reminded\nme of The Untouchables a bit.

It is nice to\nsometimes be able to empathize with the characters as well. I can't\nreally think of anything negative at this point either. Maybe that most\nof the movie was kind of predictable.

{"review": "\nI have never read the book so did not know the ending of this story\n(which I will not give away). I suggest however, that nobody watch this\nfilm without at least reading the synopsis so they know how it ends -\nit may change your mind about watching it in the first place or at\nleast prepare you for one of the most tasteless endings in a film ever.\nThe problem is that the movie is so sweet and monotoned that the\ndepressing ending both assaults you and offends. It is not giving\nanything away to say that the male character is contemplating Dignatas'\nservices. With no judgement whatsoever on this it is important to note\nthat this is a compassionate organisation, but according to all media\nfar from luxurious. The book may have dealt in detail with the realty\nof disability so deadly or degrading that the sufferer feels deeply\nthey need release. However, this movie treats the illnesses associated\nwith the male character's disability as intermittent blips in an\notherwise improving quality of life. It leaves such a bitter taste in\nthe mouth because the conclusion is that a valuable life must be\nexpansive and in an able body! Being close to parents, loving\nunconditionally, life unexpected are failures. It is a shame as the\nperformances are great - if the movie was a real romcom with a joyful\nending or a serious drama with a tragic twist this story could have\nworked - unfortunately, it was neither; rather it was an amusing film\nthat meandered off the side of a cliff with a thud...\n"},

{"review": "\nMe Before You is an outstanding adaptation of Jojo Moyes' novel about\nLouisa taking care of the moody and pretentious Will Traynor.

Even though some may see\nthis as a clich\u00e9 movie where Louisa finds Will love and expresses it\nthroughout the movie whilst adding a lot of humour, it's the ending of\nthis movie which changes a lot of views and perspectives. For me\nespecially, I found it very emotional as did many who watched it\nbecause you expect there to be a happy ending.

I will be very curious to see if this\nreview will even see the light of day and if not then I will never\ntrust or even come to IMDb for movie reviews.<br><br>As for the movie... I had great expectations after seeing the trailer\nbut was such a disappointment. First... there is no love story in this\nmovie. The whole movie is about a rich paraplegic man who is so\nimmersed in self pity about loosing his \"tremendous\" past life that is\nincapable of any emotions for the people around him. OK... and a girl\nwho gets attached to him... but settles for some money reward for her\nbroken heart. The movie is predictable, pathetic, has no real drama or\nmessage. The actors have potential but are not believable due to the\nlack of a true love story in the script. What a missed opportunity, I\ncould close my eyes and imagine how this movie could have been written\nto be one of the best, a real dramatic struggle between love and\nphysical pain, rich and poor, life and death.\n"},

{"review": "\n23 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Me Before\nYou. When quirky Lou Clark loses her job in a tea shop she is left\ndesperate to get a new one to help support her family. Along comes the\nTraynor family. Will Traynor, a quadriplegic needs a carer although he\ndoesn't think he wants one, at this point Lou comes into his world and\nturns it upside down. Will is set on ending his life, Lou discovers\nthis and embarks on a scheme to make him change his mind. Adapted from\na book (which I haven't read yet) we are introduced to two very\ndifferent kinds of people, Will who yearns for the old life he lost and\nsees every day as an empty glass, and Lou who's bubbly personality and\ninfectious smile lead her glass to not only be full, but positively\noverflowing. This is a story of hardship, and of hope and also\nintroduces us to the ethical and very personal struggles of people not\nonly considering assisted suicide but also the family and friends who\nhave no say in the matter but want very much to get involved. It was a\nvery emotional journey, there were many light hearted moments and a\nvery fitting soundtrack.

I cannot\nthink of another actress that will portray her character, well Daisy\nRidley can because Emilia Clarke's performance did remained me of her.\nSam Claflin was serviceable, he can easily be replaced. The story is\nreally what drives this movie to the top. The relationship between Lou\nand Will is great, you really believe that they are in love. The music\nis used appropriately, only one time it annoyed me but it was once and\nit did not take me out of the film. The cinematography was great as\nwell as the production design. The biggest problem i have with this\nfilm its is 3 act. It is really cheesy and makes the clich\u00e9 that one\nperson gets mad with one another, and you know they're gonna get back\ntogether and its just lazy writing. Its not awful but it ain't good\neither. Also since Emilia Clarke is so fantastic as her character, its\nreally distracting when she is not in a scene, and you kind off get\nlost in the story.

{"review": "\nI loved this movie \u0097 so much so, that I've watched it five times so\nfar!<br><br>I am usually very critical of movies, but not this one. It is a bit\nformulaic at times, but I think the director also shows a great deal of\nrestraint. For example, Will Traynor's mother and father (Janet McTeer\nand Charles Dance) start out as caricatures of British aristocrats \u0097\nstuffy, aloof, unfeeling, even a bit mean. But as the movie progresses,\nyou see them more and more as human beings with deep feelings, and you\nsee that they love each other and their son very much, and that they\nstruggle to do the right thing by their son. They are also very kind to\nLouisa, and despite the class difference, they never betray the kind of\nsnobbery you might expect to see in a less sophisticated treatment. <br><br>There seems to be some criticism of Louisa Clarke (Emilia Clarke) as a\nBridget Jones-type character \u0097 kind of silly, offbeat, \"chatty,\" and so\non. I find her utterly charming. (But then I also find Bridget Jones\nutterly charming.) Louisa is a believable character and not one\ndimensional.<br><br>I love the chemistry between Lou and Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). Will's\ntransformation is not sudden. He actually is intrigued by Louisa from\nthe get-go but doesn't realize it \u0097 he's too busy putting on his act\nand being sullen and angry and self-absorbed \u0097 so it's only when she\nsnaps at him, that he begins to be pulled outside of his emotional\nbubble. It's actually shocking for him to see this other side of Lou \u0097\nthat she's not rigidly upbeat but is capable of anger \u0097 and so this\nmoment triggers the start of a deeper connection. <br><br>I think all the characters are well done, and the only character I\nfound a bit cartoonish is the boyfriend, Patrick (Matthew Lewis). <br><br>It's a beautiful movie, and I highly recommend it.

Sharrock decided to give the audience the real\ntruth about life. We would want to hope for the best and think that\nthere are such things as happily ever after's; but truthfully that\nisn't the case.

I think that Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin were perfect\ntogether in this film and so great chemistry. That's why the film was\nso good. People that didn't like this film must have a cold heart. Film\ncritics are always writing about the film so they can't get into the\nfilm and follow the beautiful story line that has been created.\n"},
{"review": "\nI completely disappointed by the movie. I am really crazy about these\ntypes of movies with a heartbreaking love story. But as a fan of\nromantic movies, the message of this movie is so negative. There are\ntwo bad messages in the movie. <br><br>First, the movie is saying to people with real disability that it's\nbetter to die than to struggle in life problems and their disability!!!\nThere are many examples of successful people such as Stephen Hawking\nand Paralympic winners even with a worse disability which proved the\nworld that disability is not a limitation for them. I can't believe how\nthey showed that a disabled person with a great love and very good\nsocial situation killed himself!!! <br><br>Second, another bad message is that money can buy love! They fall in\nlove when they used lots of money and I think it is not reasonable as a\npure love.<br><br>On the other hand, as a positive point, I can mention that the movie is\nwell acted. Specially Emilia Clarke and her facial expressions were\nexcellent and amazing.\n"},

It tried to be\ntouching, but it wasn't whatsoever. and the soundtrack was bad, i love\ned sheeran, but using such popular songs kind of ruins it, and\n''photograph''didn't fit in that scene at all, and that romantic comedy\ntype of music didn't help. Some of the camera work felt odd as well.

And, i don't think the movie delivered the message of being\nbetter off dead, some people just cant overcome their disability. It\ndoesn't mean all disabled people are like Will.\n"},
{"review": "\nMany times we have seen this in the past: A successful author teams up\nwith inexperienced director, add some well-known faces and you are in\nfor a insignificant piece of film making. The story for this one, I\nbeen told, is much more believable and interesting on the pages of the\nbest seller book by the same author that wrote the script. And that's a\nbit confusing as why would a successful piece of literature would turn\ninto a very sloppy, cheesy, inconsequential film. The main problem I\nhave with it is, however, the amount of clich\u00e9s that keep coming one\nafter other. I found myself guessing all the time which clich\u00e9 would be\nthe next, which scene would show that this film was no more that a\ncollage of clich\u00e9s that murder the narrative. The scene when Luisa's\nboyfriend tells her about his plans for a holiday that include all his\nfriends just sums it up. And then there's the characters - small town\ngirl from working class parents that talks with a public school accent\nan has an infinite wardrobe. When I look at the characters I can only\nsee the actors, and that's not good. In fact some of them (Charles\nDance, Jenna Coleman, Joanna Lumley and Diane Morgan) seem to have been\nsigned up only to add well known faces to the cast list - they add no\nvalue as actors to the film. And there's more that I could add that can\nexplain the disappointment of watching these 109 minutes without\nfeeling that you are wasting your time, but I leave it here. In summary\n- Sloppy story telling, questionable casting, poor acting, clich\u00e9s,\nclich\u00e9s and clich\u00e9s. Avoid.\n"},

It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in\nit. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch\nexpecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it\ndelivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill\nand alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall\neveryone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.<br><br>Anyway, the film avoids the usual clich\u00e9.

Basically, if you observe closely the both\ntwo lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life.\nParticularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to\naccomplish her undertaking.<br><br>On the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us\na cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a\ngood watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs,\nsexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme\nis something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people.\nOther than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.<br><br>7/10\n"},

Ms Clarke is annoying; the movie is\noverly long, it is predictable, and I have little sympathy for any of\nthe characters. Clarke does not stand up to her unemployed father and\nsister who wants Clarke to work to support the family so the sister can\nescape.

Moreover,\nhe and his family have more money than Trump.<br><br>The story is an old one. Quirky young woman cares for person with\nphysical problems.

{"review": "\nThis was shaping up to be a realistic and powerful story, especially\nwhen Louisa told Will that killing himself was selfish.

There can be no peace in that. There\ncan be no peace for those who witness that. I am reminded of the young\nwoman who wanted to kill herself because her mother had never loved her\nbecause she was a girl instead of a boy. Those who were so caught up in\nthe culture of death though it was such a wonderful thing that she\ncould be free to end her life.

In the first 30 minutes of the movie, I already saw this was\ngoing to be great. Emilia can show so many emotions in her face without\neven trying, which makes it clear why they chose her. The way she lived\nLou in the movie was just amazing, real and definitely sincere.<br><br>This is a must-see movie, not only today, but tomorrow, next year and\nin 10 years as well.<br><br>Rating : 10/10 for sure!\n"},
{"review": "\nI don't usually go for this type of film, I'm a superhero film type of\nguy. But because the beautiful Emilia Clarke starred in it, I forced it\nonto my screen and boy I'm glad I did! Some people say bad things about\nEmilia Clarke and her acting, but yet again, unsurprisingly she was\nperfect. Through my heightened sense of empathy, I could imagine how a\nparalysed man would feel, and Sam Clafin performed the role to\nperfection. For a soppy romance movie, this was great. 8/10, it's\nmissing two for the silly reason that it is a romance film, I rated The\nFlash a 10, so rating this 10 would go against my core values. In\nconclusion, even is this movie is not something you'd usually watch\nbecause of its genre, I'd give it a chance anyway, because...Emilia\nClarke, even in her dorky dresses was absolutely sublime, and it's\nworth watching just because of her, well, it was my reason anyway.\n"},
{"review": "\nI don't care what anyone says I loved this movie. The movies always\nmiss things out when they are based from books so I will defiantly be\nbuying the books too.<br><br>The cast where the perfect pick I don't think anyone else could have\nplayed the roles to well, the soundtrack also was really nice defiantly\non my download list.<br><br>I personally thought the movie was amazing and utterly heart breaking\nat the same time I was an emotional wreck close to the end. Its a movie\neveryone can relate to in same way or another and at the same time was\nvery thought provoking. It has humour, romance and everything you could\nwant form a tear jerker<br><br>Officially one of my favorite movies of all time.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have to say this is one of the best films I have seen in a long time,\nignore the critics and see this film. I cannot express how good it is\nand how heartwarming the story is. I have seen some heartbreaking films\nin my time like Beaches for instance, but this film from the beginning\nto the end was truly pulling at the heartstrings, top notch\nperformances from everyone, this film is definitely a must see, if you\nwant a Sunday afternoon tear jerk-er look no further than this film, I\nwould give it more than 10 if I could. Sam Claflin was by far fantastic\nin this film along with Emilia Clarke, the soundtrack goes great, I\ndon't want to say anything about the film or spoilers, but see for\nyourself how amazing this film is, you will agree it is really a top\nnotch film for 2016.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is a copy / remake of French movie 'The Intouchables'\nreleased in 2011, which was also remade in Tamil language as'Thozha' in\nMarch 2016. Correct me if I am wrong. I will remove my comment /\nreview.<br><br>The Tamil movie had Nagarjuna, the Telugu super star in the lead role\nas a rich disabled man. Kathik, the leading hero from Tamil as being a\nconvict of petty cases in the province of Tamil Nadu being a care giver\nby chance. He falls in love with the lady who is managing the affairs\nof the billionaire. Then the story spins around how, the rich finds his\nemail companion and the care giver finds his love realised and blessed\nby the rich. This movie resembles the same. Let me k ow, whether, my\nstatement is true\n"},
{"review": "\nOkay, let me start with the positives. This firm is well acted and is,\non one level, a reasonable, weepy romance. However, the relationship\nbetween the leading couple seems unrealistically intense because the\nactors are not given sufficient screen time or dialogue to develop it.\nThat said, my biggest problem with this movie is it's message.<br><br>At this point I should briefly explain that I was born disabled and I\nam unable to walk. I will remain this way for the rest of my life. I\ncope with this in one very simple way, I focus on what I can do and not\nwhat I can't, what I have got, not what I have am without. So, I found\nthe fact that the leading man in this film decided to take his own life\ndue to a paralysing accident hard to accept. He had so much to live\nfor, a supportive family, a great house that had been adapted to suit\nhis needs, a specially adapted vehicle and loads of money! However,\nthis was clearly not enough as he is still really unhappy and has a\nmassive chip on his shoulder, as he waits, counting the days until he\ncan end his own life! Then this gorgeous, kind, lovely young lady comes\ninto his life, they fall in love, she practically begs him not to go\nthrough with it but to no avail. <br><br>This is such a negative message, which is offensive to people living\nhappy lives with disabilities. It also serves to reinforce negative\nstereotypes surrounding disabilities. I wanted to see the ending in\nwhich she made him realise his life was worth living. Now that would\nhave been living boldly!\n"},
{"review": "\nI watched this film and really enjoyed it, which is strange for me and\nit being a \"chick flick\", and it wasn't until the end that I realised\nshe was Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones because she is so\ndifferent in the roles.<br><br>Great script with lots of both funny moments with the humour and\nserious moments with the story behind it. It was well put together,\nbrilliantly cast and beautifully filmed in all the various lovely\nsettings.<br><br>I might not be Oscar material but nonetheless it totally captivated me\nand entertained me which is why I watch a film in the first place.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat would you do if your life wouldn't be the same? If you shall be\ntotally depending on another person? This is the tragedy that the\nprotagonist has to face when his life is devastated by an accident.\nMovie with good rhythm, deeply sad. I couldn't hold back the tears... I\ndidn't read the trailer, and for the first 30 minutes you don't really\nhave a clue of where the story if going eventually. Incredible\nexpressiveness for Emilia Clarke. She can really make the difference\nwith her touch, even if her character is a bit too emphasized and her\nstory isn't thorough in the end. Eventually we all should be glad of\nwhat we have in our life.\n"},
{"review": "\nA fairly good story by Jojo Moyes gets deep-sixed by awful, awful,\nmusic cuts and transitions infesting scene shift after scene in what\ncould've been a good albeit maudlin script of \"Me Before You\". Fault\nlies mostly with editors and director Thea Sharrock for completely\nover-indulging singing music cuts. Sorry Sharrock, in editing with film\nwhen it comes to music and audio, less is more. Kumbaya might be OK for\ncampfires, but not for stories of paraplegics or cinema. MTV is its own\ncategory. There's a time and a place for it, but not in supposedly\nserious subject matter. Clarke and Claflin are not at fault and do a\ngood job in this movie. Too bad directors and editors cannot fathom or\nrecognize their own tacky and poor soundtrack editing. 5/10 cannot\nrecommend.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe book wasn't great,but i liked it anyway (shame on me :D ) and so\nwanted to check out the movie. The movie is disgustingly bad... The\npacing feels unnatural and rushed,the love story somehow feels forced,\nthe use of music is so sooooo bland and tasteless, the acting of both\nmain characters is embarrassing, especially Emilia Clarke's.I kind of\nthought she would be a good actress since she's on Game of Thrones, but\nshe was atrocious in this movie! Trying to make big puppy eyes, smiling\nbig and raising her eyebrows to oblivion did not make her adorable, it\nmade her punch-able.<br><br>I will never recommend it to anyone, will never re-watch it,bad movie,\nwill forget it in....yep, already forgot.\n"},
{"review": "\nEmilia Clarke is awful in this. Not real acting here...who else agrees\nwith me on this? <br><br>Her eyebrows are crazy and so are her facial expressions. Very amateur\nfake-ish acting, couldn't even watch the movie. Tried watching it right\nafter I read the book, tried watching it again on the plane today. Just\ncould not finish it. There is also no real chemistry or good portrayal\nof some sort of chemistry between them. All the other actors are okay-\nish....not too interesting. <br><br>She cannot play innocent and docile. Much better as the mother of\ndragons in GOT...\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was decent - definitely a big tear jerker.<br><br>Will, his parents and his carer were all very good characters - so well\nacted but Lou? To me she just seemed wet and a constant pushover. I\nwasn't a fan of her or her family. It bugged me how she couldn't just\ntell her boyfriend why she was doing all the things with Will she was\ndoing.<br><br>A lot of people say this is a feel good movie - to be honest I just\nfinished watching and I feel kinda depressed by it - he wanted to die\nand nothing was changing his mind, that's it really. Nothing feel good\nabout that ...<br><br>Still, if you want a good cry - watch it...it'll do the job there.\n"}
