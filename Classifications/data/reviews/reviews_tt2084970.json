{"review": "\nBrilliant adaptation of the story of Bletchley Park and the\ncryptanalysis team, ran by Alan Turing, that cracked the code of the\nGerman Enigma Machine during World War II. Featuring an outstanding\nstarring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as war hero Turning and\nsupporting acts from a brilliant cast including Keira Knightley,\nCharles Dance and Mark Strong, 'The Imitation Game' is a powerful and\neminently well-made biopic that illuminates the facts whilst respecting\nthe story it is based upon. The English-language debut of 'Headhunters'\ndirector Morten Tyldum, this British World War II thriller is a highly\nconventional story about humanity that creates a fascinating character,\nanchored by a hypnotically complex performance.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'll make my review short. Go see this. It has all the elements of a\ngreat movie from the acting to the score by Alexandre Desplat.\nExcellent script and delivery. It was well received at TIFF 14 where it\nwas named People's Choice. The cast members really gelled on screen. It\nwas well edited because the pace of the movie did not lag at any time.\nWhen watching this you will quickly realize that these actors (Benedict\nCumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Allen Leech)\nwill be around for a long time entertaining us. If you like A Beautiful\nMind or even Good Will Hunting, you will enjoy this. It comes out in\nNovember 2014. Don't miss it. This one is Oscar worthy.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis is THE movie for anyone who wants to learn about the birth of all\nmodern computing and cryptography. It also provides a deep commentary\non the ignorance of people who hate those who do not fit in. I wish the\nfilm could have gone into more detail about Alan Turing after the war\nwhen his deepest personal struggles were in full force. However, for a\ntheatrical film it would have been far too long. This film illustrates\nhow far we have come as a society in terms of accepting gay and\nlesbians and their contributions to society. I will not spoil the film\nbut for the cypherpunks out there you will be a little uneasy if you\ncompare the MI-6 tactics to those of today's NSA and other three letter\nagencies that spy on our every digital move. All in all a brilliant\nfilm with great actors that will move your hearts and minds.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt is a shame this movie is a stack of lies.First time polish broke\nenigma it was in 1932, 1933 they created first working example of\nEnigma, and first anti-enigma device, narrowing settings combination to\n105 456. In 1936 Germans changed the design, and Polish answered with\nRejewsky bomb, machine with 6 enigma connected together,breaking new\ndaily code in 2 hours.Another German changes required building 54\ndifferent machine designs, and Poland didn't have enough money so they\nasked allies to help.July 1939 Uk and French representatives visited\nWarsaw and got all documentation how to break ENIGMA.After beginning of\nthe war, polish encoders moved to Paris, and British started Bletchley\nPark operation. Unfortunately, Polish people are always forgotten,\nbecause they are not part of US/UK/France/Germany nation.Shame on you\nBritain.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film, while entertaining, aims mainly to be a purely twenty-first\ncentury anti-bullying parable, regardless of the historical truth about\nAlan Turing. While I have been more firmly opposed than most to\nboarding school bullying, in this case, the nobler the goal, the worse\nthe writing. The film tries unsuccessfully to make Turing both a\nfriendless quasi-autistic lone genius, and the head of the entire\ndecryption project; neither point has any relation to reality, and\nbarely cohere to each other. (I admit to some bitterness about this\nslur on my grand- supervisor, since it implicitly denies the existence\nof my graduate-school supervisor.)<br><br>The film also does disservice to Joan Clarke's genuine contributions,\nsubstituting a muddled and completely ahistorical subplot about her\nprofessional dependence on, and mathematical superiority to, Turing,\nwhile seeming more concerned with her appearance than her intellect.\n"},
{"review": "\nI really enjoyed watching the movie, however left the cinema\ndisappointed! Fantastic story, great Alan Turing - pioneer of computer\nscience. BUT - German military texts enciphered on the Enigma machine\nwere first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December\n1932. This success was a result of efforts by three Polish\ncryptologists, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki and Henryk Zygalski,\nworking for Polish military intelligence. Alan devised a number of\ntechniques for breaking German ciphers, including improvements to the\npre-war Polish bombe method. Shame Polish Intelligence was omitted in\nthe movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have just one comment. Why is a movie founded on a lie such a huge\nsuccess and even nominated for an Oscar? Alan Turing was not the first\nguy to crack the code. He and others at Bletchley Park were merely the\nsmart folks who used Polish groundbreaking cryptography methods to\ntackle Enigma. Turing is portrayed here as a hero and the success as\nsolely his, all according to the sneaky writers of The Imitation Game.\nDid they forget to carry out a proper research or was their mission to\nundermine Polish part a deliberate thing? Brits often forget about\ntheir 2WW allies, ascribing all the war effort success to themselves.\nBut hey, even 'bletchleyparkorg', the official website, says \"The Poles\nbroke Enigma in 1932\"...In 1939 with the invasion on Poland imminent\nthe Poles reached out to Britons for help and thus Bletchley Park\nbecame the centre where cryptographers were unscrambling the code.

{"review": "\nIn a way its difficult to write a review on this film about the life of\nAlan Turing, perhaps after Einstein the greatest scientist of the 20th\ncentury.The difficulty is the character of Turing which is given a\nportrayal by Benedict Cumberbatch which is one of the finest I have\never seen on screen. Turing invented the Turing machine which all\nmodern digital computers have their foundation,but is Turing actually a\nmachine himself? He is almost like DATA from Star Trek, in this very\nspecial performance. Alex Lawther as young Turing is also absolutely\nbrilliant. This life story of Turing is shown in three parts, swinging\nbackwards and forwards. The only weakness is when we get to the major\n\"faction\" part of the story concerning the Soviet spy John Cairncross.\nAnybody that knows the true story concerning Cairncross knows that this\ninteraction with Turing is a load of fiction. The rest of the Enigma\nstory is fair enough, although the way how the \"cribs\" such as Heil\nHitler were discovered is treated in the film, with lets say a poetic\nlicense, which is OK by me.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat an absolutely riveting watch this is! There is some superb acting\nin this imagined story giving an explanation of Turing's role in the\ncode-breaking efforts at the secret Bletchley Park. Even Cumberbatch's\nbright blue eyes give us a story - pinched pupil's at the moment he\n'separates' from Joan Clarke (Knightley), for example. Thankfully,\nKnightley gives us a better performance than she has done for some\ntime, though, some dialogue could have been better formulated. I might\nalso quibble with the less than believable hat-less and cap-less\ncharacters at times - Charles Dance's luminous white bonce should often\nhave been under a hat and, there should have been more Brylcream in\nevidence. But, hey, this is a really engaging film. Motives, scenes and\nquotes quite likely filched from other stories are used to set the\nscene - and set the scene they really do. We don't necessarily have to\nbelieve them though. Turing is, in this presentation, given an\nAsperger-like tic - well, true or not, it helps this particular story\nalong very well.\n"},
