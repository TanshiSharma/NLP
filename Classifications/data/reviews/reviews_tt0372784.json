{"review": "\nChristopher Nolan (and cast) have pulled off what I hadn't dared to\ndream - a Batman every bit as good as Burton/Keaton's vision - and\neradicated the camp, feverish memories of Clooney, Kilmer and (cough..)\nO'Donnell.<br><br>The story is as good an origin story as you'll find - covering all the\nmajor (true-to-the-comic) events, and not wasting ages on them. We see\nWayne's all-important training period (previously ignored), and his\nconnection to the Tibetan shadow-ninja clan led by Ra's Al Ghul. We see\nBruce come up with ideas for his symbol, his costume, his gadgets, his\ncar, his cave - IT ALL FITS SO PERFECTLY.<br><br>That's not all - Liam Neeson is perfect (as ever, when Lucas isn't\nwriting his lines), Batman's first mad nemesis (the Scarecrow) is\ngenuinely frightening; with some outstandingly scary 'fear' effects..\nGary Oldman looks just like a young Commissioner Gordon (and doesn't\ndominate), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer give solid heavyweight\nsupport to the boardroom machinations at Wayne Enterprizes. I love\nMichael Gough(?) but Michael Caine is great as Alfred. It's only Katie\nHolmes who didn't ring true for me - not because of her performance,\nbut simply because she looks all of 15 years old (sorry Katie). I am\nalways blown away by Christian Bale, and this is no exception.<br><br>The fights are great, the Bat-gadgets all there, the car is amazing,\nthe plot is thorough and exciting, Gotham looks great, Batman really is\nfrightening &amp; menacing (and lethal!).. And the scenes with the bats\nthemselves FINALLY get across the idea of how scary they can be.<br><br>There is some humour, but it's fairly dry. The soundtrack, like all the\nbest original soundtracks, is excellent - you hardly know it's there,\nbut the emotions of the scene are enhanced and boosted. For the most\npart this is a serious Batman film, with plenty for long-time fans.\nThis NEW Batman is one I'd like to see again. Bravo Mr Nolan, bravo.\n"},
{"review": "\nI got a chance to see 'Batman Begins' just this past Friday evening. I\nmust say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the\n'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the\nmovie, I turned to my date and said to her, \"This is it! This is the\nmovie!\" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros.\nfinally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film,\napart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's\ndecision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really\nexist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another\naspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus\nbeing on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's\namazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and\nthe creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie\npossible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes\nand the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager\nplaying grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you\nreally don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I\nfelt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too\nquickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was\ngoing on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this\nto the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next\nfilm will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use\nthe martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from\nthose relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm\ndefinitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second\ntime. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.\n"},
{"review": "\nI just came back from a special screening of Batman Begins and I must\nsay this is the best movie I have yet seen this year. All of the\nblockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been\ndisappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film;\nit incorporates all aspects of genre: action, fantasy, drama, and even\ncomedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes\nand clapping &amp; laughing from the humorous lines that director\nChristopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed\nby the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming\nthat they wouldn't have been able to compete with and compliment the\ntalented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary\nOldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn't have asked for better\nactors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the\nintensity, physique, and charm you'd expect a Batman character to\nencompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even\ngive props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering\nher previous roles consisted of \"the young girl\" or \"girlfriend\". <br><br>I hardly ever see action films nowadays because I don't want to waste\nmy time watching a conventional, corny, over-digitalized,plot less\nfilm. To be honest, I gave this film a chance not because it was a\nBatman movie, but rather because of the talented veteran actors as well\nas being a fan of Christopher Nolan's previous films. Whether you're a\nfan of Christopher Nolan or just a Batman fanatic, you'll enjoy every\nsingle second of the movie. People of ALL ages will appreciate this\nfilm. The violence in this movie is not vulgar, but rather sends out a\nlot of great messages of loyalty, respect, and humility. Not only is\n\"Batman Begins\" the best of the Batman series, it is the most\nunconventional. This recommendation is coming from a person who mostly\nwatches art-house/independent films.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film easily trumps any live-action incarnation we've scene of the\nDark Knight before, borrowing heavily from both the comics and the Dini\nand Co. animated series. This is a hard, fast, driving, heartfelt epic\nthat draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you damn\nwell care. Batman doesn't play second-fiddle to the villains here like\nin the other films. It's his movie and that's the way it should be.<br><br>Much has been said of the film's \"reality\" quotient, and I'm here to\nsay it works. Nolan talks about how Batman's strong because he does\npush-ups, he gets around because of his gadgets, and by introducing\neach of them with a plausible explanation, we forget to quibble and go\nalong with it. The technology may be fantastic, but it's believable.\nAnd, unlike the \"reality\" of something like Daredevil, Nolan doesn't\nforget his ideals halfway though and start having Batman wire-jump\nthirty feet into the air.\n"},
{"review": "\nI've just come back from a preview screening of Batman Begins. I went\nin with low expectations, despite the excellence of Christopher Nolan's\nprevious efforts. Talk about having your expectations confounded! This\nfilm grips like wet rope from the start. I won't give away any of the\nstory; suffice to say it mixes and matches its sources freely, tossing\nin a dash of Frank Miller, a bit of Alan Moore and a pinch of Bob Kane\nto great effect. <br><br>What's impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise, Nolan\nhas managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie.\nThe story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half, and\nthere are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes. Parents thinking\nof taking their young kids along, think twice. When we left, a\nterrified 8-year-old boy was being comforted by his parents. Some of\nwhat's up there on screen really is the stuff of nightmares.<br><br>Of the cast of Brits chosen to bring this American tale to the masses,\nChristian Bale convinces in his dual role, while Michael Caine as\nAlfred comes up with the humour just when the film is in danger of\ntaking itself too seriously. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson provide able\nsupport, as does Morgan Freeman. <br><br>Most refreshing of all is the way that Nolan and co have come up with a\nway of bringing comics to the screen that does justice to the often\nadult source material in a way that, say, Daredevil, tried and failed\nto do (although the director's cut is better). If the Dark Knight\ndoesn't return after this, there's no justice.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt had some original stuff that displayed intelligence and thought with\nregards to his suit, car and weaponry. It did try to dwell on Bruce a\nlot more and convey some of his darkness but I found towards the end it\nbecame very Hollywood-ised. Sometimes filmmakers try to over complicate\nthings and this was a good example.<br><br>I don't know why they can't have a simple bad guy with a simple plan,\nwhy do they have to be so elaborate a plot leaving a growing feeling of\ninevitability that by the end there will be some big explosions,\nbuilding destruction, lots of flashing lights and Batman will prevail.<br><br>The inability of seeing the fighting was immensely frustrating. I don't\nthink I saw him actually land a single punch. It seems a fight scene\nwould be imminent and the makers would speed up the camera, ramp up the\nbass on the sound, scatter the scene with crunching thuds and smacks\nbut then forget to actually choreograph a fight. Maybe believing that\nif we heard the thuds and saw some activity on the screen that the\naudience would imagine the rest and think 'wow, what a scene'. I'd much\nrather have two or three clearly thrown punches or kicks than 1-2\nminutes of whirling cape, bangs and crashes and people falling to the\nground.<br><br>It's a shame that they re-launch the franchise in a blaze of 'this is\ngoing to be darker and different' which it certainly starts off doing\nbefore descending a little bit into Hollywood banality. Why not have\nthe courage to really shake things up, have the bravery to maybe end it\nbadly (taking T3's lead) or just not conform to the normal formula.<br><br>Showed promise, had some clever stuff and made more of an effort than\nsome in the franchise but still nothing to rival Batman:Mask of the\nPhantasm as the best batman ever made in my opinion.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have just seen The Dark Knight, and while I wanted to review it as\nfast as I could, I felt it might make more sense to at least review\nit's prequel, Batman Begins. It focuses on Bruce Wayne's beginnings.\nHow he became Batman, and why he did so. He reflects a lot about his\nparents' death from a murderer, and gets sent to jail after having his\nrevenge. In jail, there is a mysterious man that will bring to another\nmysterious man by the name of R\u00e2s-\u00c2l-Ghul, who trains him to become a\nwarrior. And, after harsh choices, Bruce Wayne then becomes Batman. The\ncast is unbelievable, the special effects are dazzling enough that they\ndon't steal from the story like in previous superhero films. Also\nunlike previous superhero films they don't hand the movie over to a\nmega-star actor as an over-the-top villain.\n"},
{"review": "\nSaw a free screening on Tuesday. I must say, I had my expectations low\nfor this one, as the previous Batman franchises was just cartoony, over\nthe top, and flat out mind dumbing. Why do studios continually think\nthat spending money on 'bankable stars' and special effects will make a\nton of money on box office receipts? Granted \"Batman Begins\" has a\npretty sizable budget, but they made the right decision with casting\nactors that can act and hiring a director that shares the same vision\nof the comic book. You will not see any caricatures of the comic book,\nbut rather be immersed in how Bruce Wayne has that internal conflict of\nmorality as he becomes Batman. Christopher Nolan takes his time\ndeveloping Bruce Wayne's character in the image that Bob Kane had with\nhis own flair to it. Anyone familiar with Nolan, Christian Bale, and\nCillian Murphy's work will not be disappointed with this movie. Make no\nmistake about it, it is a dark movie, which is what makes it so great.\nNolan uses CG effects very sparingly (thank God!).<br><br>I rarely give movies a 10 out of 10, as I am pretty brutal with\nratings, but Nolan resurrects a failed franchise. Personally, this is\nwhat Batman should have been all along - The Dark Knight! Anyone who is\na Batman, Nolan, Bale, Murphy fan will not be disappointed. I only wish\nI took that money I spent on \"Star Wars: ... Sith\" went to \"Batman\".\n"},
{"review": "\nBeing a fan of Nolan's previous work, I went into this with high\nexpectations, and yet somehow, my expectations were surpassed. My\ncongratulations to the entire cast and crew for making such a\nphenomenal film.<br><br>It all begins with the story. Nolan and Goyer didn't just adapt from\nthe comic book, they re- imagined and re-invented Batman and his world\nwhile staying true to it. I might even say what they did was in some\nways better than the comic book. Things in the comic book that would\nprobably seem preposterous in a live action film are brought to life in\nan intelligent way, like the reason for the costume, and the reason for\nthe villains and their costumes. I won't go too much into the story,\nbecause I think it's best for people to go into this film knowing as\nlittle as possible.<br><br>Christian Bale IS Bruce Wayne, and IS Batman. It will be hard to ever\nsee someone else play the role. The look on his face when Joe Chill\nwalks out of the courtroom... That demonic voice he gives Batman... The\nway he tries to hide his pain when he's told that \"the apple has fallen\nfar from the tree\"... an incredible performance. The rest of the cast\nis fantastic too, with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman dishing out\nsome great humor.<br><br>And the film looks great. Gotham actually looks like a real city (with\nnods to Blade Runner), the lighting is nice and contrasty, and Batman\nis believable as a flesh and blood character. Even the flying scenes\nare handled nicely. It's hard to talk about this film without giving\nthings away. If you haven't seen it, please see do. You won't be\ndisappointed. I'd like to thank Warner Brothers for letting an\nintelligent and talented filmmaker make this film without much\ninterference. Please make more like this one.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis new take on Batman just doesn't seem to work quite right. Nolan\ntries to basically get Shakespearean with the character and completely\nignore the first four films. In some ways that works but in other ways\nit veers off into a Batman universe that makes no sense and becomes\nbasically a movie that seems like he's attempting to have Batman seem\nmore realistic to being like a person in our real universe. This is\nwhere Nolan fails. The magic and fun of Batman evaporates quickly. A\nman dressing up as a bat and fighting crime has a humorous element to\nit that Nolan completely ignores with this incarnation and everyone in\nthis universe acts really dumb about it and their reactions to it make\nlittle sense especially Gordon's character. A lot of what Gordon does\nlacks logical sense and he never seems to really question the mental\nstate of the person he first sees dressed as a bat. He's portrayed like\nsome idiot willing to eventually put complete trust in someone he knows\npractically nothing about running around in a bat suit. His reasons for\nbeing so trusting are never clear. Does he know something everyone else\ndoesn't? Bale's performance was pretty average but not as compelling as\nKeaton or Kilmer. He also tries to have a Batman voice that sounds\nridiculous. The only reason for this film's critical success is that it\nstruck a cord with the comic book fan die hards. It certainly didn't do\nthat impressive box office numbers. Now with news that Nolan is going\nto present The Joker in a sequel, I see a potential disaster waiting to\nhappen.\n"},
{"review": "\nSorry to upset die-hard Batman comic book fans, but I really hate and\ndetest this movie. It is an insult to the 'Batman' I love and remember\nfrom my childhood. The Burton/Schumacher pictures were marvellous fun\nbecause they did not take themselves seriously. All I got from this one\nwas a king-size headache and a sore bottom where I was bored senseless\nfor the best part of two hours. Chris Nolan thinks 'Batman' should be\ntaken dead seriously. A rich man who goes out at night in a rubber suit\ndesigned to resemble a bat? Oh, come on! Putting the Caped Crusader in\na film like this is like making 'Austin Powers' the star of a Daniel\nCraig-type Bond film. Worse, the chief villain - The Scarecrow (\nCillian Murphy ) - is another nut, only this one runs round with a sack\non his head! Michael Caine's 'Alfred' cannot hold a Bat-candle either\nto Alan Napier or Michael Gough. The story of this film...well, was\nthere one? All I saw was a lot of fighting with nothing in-between. It\nhas been announced that Warner Bros. are rebooting the franchise once\nmore. Good idea. They need to use the Burton/Schumacher movies as a\ntemplate for any further entries. This one hit the big screen with all\nthe force of a wet lettuce. Ker-flop!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis latest Batman film disappointed a lot of people....but not me. I\nappreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence, didn''t have a\nstupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and fount it an\ninteresting history of how Batman became Batman. <br><br>The first hour of this \"prequel\" dealt with his origins. If you're a\nfan of the comic book stories and the other Batman films, this part in\nthe film should not bore you. It was like a documentary to me, about a\ntopic I was interested in. In fact, on the second viewing I enjoyed\nthis even more.<br><br>Christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman.

This is a film that describe's Batman\nas he was in the comics and i think as Bob Kane imagined...So how has\nNolan done it..Simple..i've seen the xtras on the Region 2 DVD and it\nappears that he didn't rush anything and really worked hard on this and\nrecruited the best of the best in the movie making business,it's an\nextremely hard character to portray and a risky franchise as a director\nto do a good job as Joel Schumacher found out. He has had some good\nfilms like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a\njoke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making\nfranchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on\nGotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing\nlikeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and\nmore because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes\nbatfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it\nhas an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in\nsucceeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The\nvillain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more\ncorrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to\nclean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and\nlifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely\none to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did..\n"},
{"review": "\nFor those of you who were disappointed with the last few Batman movies,\n'Batman Begins' redeems the caped crusader in a big way. 'Batman\nBegins' takes us on a journey through Bruce Wayne's tragic past again,\ngiving us a real insight into what drives and fuels his quest against\nsuffering and injustice. We discover how the billionaire came to be\ntrained in the martial arts, develop his alter ego, and acquire his\ntechnological arsenal. Christian Bale gives us a riveting performance\nas not only a very dark hero, but also a tortured soul looking for the\nmeans to combat the wrongs of society, a society that we see is also\nresponsible for the death of his beloved parents. Another thing we\nnotice from the beginning is this story does not tie into that of the\nother movies in the series. This is however not a disappointing\nfeature, in fact it seems to breathe new life into this timeless\nclassic. So for all of us who have followed the Dark Knight's\njourney's, strap yourself in for a wild and inspiring ride.\n"},
{"review": "\nAm I missing something? What is it people saw in this movie to give it\nsuch a high rating? It must be Nolan fans and studio plants.

This was a complete departure\nfrom not only the previous Batman films but certainly Bob Kane's\noriginal intention. There has to be at least a sprinkling of humor for\nBatman to work and make sense because a man dressing up as a bat does\ncome across as humorous no matter how you cut it. The idea is Bruce\nWayne has gone so far into a dark place in his mind that he does go\ncrazy and a man running around as a bat is crazy and a little funny.\nThis film tried to make the notion so serious that it was too serious\nto be taken literally. And as far as everybody complaining about how in\nthe first Batman Bruce Wayne's parents were killed by The Joker, stop\nyour whining. I laughed at the court room scene where the criminal who\nkilled Bruce Wayne's parents is shot walking out of the court room by\na...woman! Then Katie Holmes reaction saying, \"Bruce you don't need to\nsee this.\" to Christian Bale muttering, \"I have to see this\". It was\nbeyond ridiculous.

I dunno... reality! let's just break this down:\n1) Characters: I couldn't have imagined a better Wayne than Keaton, but\nafter I've seen Bailey he completely disappointed me, because I kept\nbetting he'd suck as Bruce Wayne.. he didn't... Absolutely brilliant\nthis kid is. Gordon (Gary Oldman) is as great as ever -although a bit\nunder-nourished. Michael Caine was just born to be Alfred, Ducard (Liam\nNeeson) was legend and Watanabe, even with a small role, flying him all\nthe way from China was worth the effort.. and Cillian... oooh Cillian\njust blew my head off with his performance, I don't think we could have\nseen the Scarecrow on screen better than we did here (although I missed\nthe ragged costume and the hay and all).<br><br>2) Gotham City: Forget all about Schumacher's \"City of Light\"... also\nforget about Burton's Gotham \"Dark even at day\" city. This is Gotham as\nit should have always been, the big rotten apple... pretty and shiny on\nthe outside, but rotting and full of maggots on the inside.<br><br>3) Christopher Nolan: Need I say more? anyone who's seen his previous\nwork will know what they're up against. Great camera work, Psychotic\nmotion effects. Pure art if I might say.<br><br>that's about it...

Bale is strong as both Bruce\nWayne and Batman. The underpin to the story line depicting how Wayne\nbecame Batman is well written and acted. There is of cause the usual\nmoral picture painted through Wayne and his childhood friend\nemphasizing that revenge is a negative motivation in cleaning up\nGotham.

{"review": "\nThis movie was absolutely dreadful.

To me the closest I\nthink was the original 1989 Batman movie. The absurdity of Batman\nBegins was how serious it was trying to be which made you laugh at it\nrather than with it. The Scarecrow was the most disappointing villain\nof any of the previous Batman films. He was completely boring and just\ndownright stupid. This film was such a complete insult to the fans who\nhave stuck with the movie series through the good sequels and the bad.\nUnfortunately a new generation of children think this is cooler than a\nBatman that makes much more sense and has an element of fun to it.\nTedious and bland is the only way to describe this new reinvention of\nthe Dark Knight. Next!\n"},
{"review": "\nEight years after the infamous abomination Batman &amp; Robin that killed\nthe Batman franchise, Christopher Nolan stepped in and started a whole\nnew series a darker (even darker than the first two Tim Burton Batman\nmovies) and realistic level. <br><br>Now at first, I wasn't mad on Batman Begins because at first I thought\nit was boring and it took a while to get to the part where Bruce Wayne\nbecomes Batman. But after a while, I loved the film. In fact, it turned\nout to be my favourite Batman movie even though I really like the first\ntwo Batman movies by Tim Burton. <br><br>I really like how we get to see the origins of Batman like the tragic\ndeath of his parents and becoming a martial arts expert in somewhere in\nAsia. Also I think it's clever how they made Batman act like a ninja\nthan a superhero. Christian Bale is really good and intimidating as\nBatman but I think he's not as good as Michael Keaton's Batman. But\nalso I think the rest of the cast did very well like Katie Holmes, Liam\nNeeson, Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy. But I can't understand why\nKatie Holmes was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress. I\nliked her as Rachel and she was a lot better than Maggie Gyllenhaal;\nnot to mention better-looking. <br><br>It's too bad The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises weren't as great\nas Batman Begins. I mean I think The Dark Knight is really overrated. I\nmean most people seem to be overglorifying it just because of Heath\nLedger's performance as the Joker and his death. But The Dark Knight\nRises was brilliant and gave a nice ending to the trilogy but I don't\nthink it wasn't as fresh as Batman Begins. By the way, happy birthday\nto the creator of Batman, the late Bob Kane!\n"},

When\nthis summer is over, Batman Begins will do the same thing for the comic\nbook genre. It shows that a reality and character driven set piece can\nwork for these types of movies. <br><br>There are NO superpowers in the movie. The villains rely on mastered\nsword fighting, physical athleticism, and cunning as their vehicles to\ncreate chaos. And although there is action, which is done masterfully,\n(The car chases and hang glide scenes will blow you away)the story is\nmoved completely by its lead character and not the events surrounding\nhim. <br><br>The movie is a journey of self discovery. One man's struggle to deal\nwith guilt and anger. And minus the batsuit and batmobile, this movie\ncould stand alone as a powerful drama about self discovery, and would\nprobably even merit Oscar consideration. The acting is superb and this\nis the first comic book movie to ever leave me with a lump in my\nthroat.

{"review": "\nThis is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made,\nalthough that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a\nvery dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than\nBatman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a\ngreat director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps\nthe most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of\nGotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but\nfrom real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the\noriginal characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there\nwithout all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put\nout. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a\nmore interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of\nWayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast,\nespecially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal\nmember of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as\nWayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as\nlong as Michael Caine resides.<br><br>Simply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you\ninto a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than\ntransports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we\ndo get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other\ninterpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than\nviolence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel\nshorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see\nThe Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first. Indeed,\nif it is anything like this one, this franchise is going somewhere\ntruly spectacular.\n"},

Seeing it on the big screen last night\nwas a thrill, the kind of thrill provided by the original \"Star Wars\"\nor \"Raiders.\" <br><br>Breathtaking cinematography combines with genius editing to replicate\nthe comic experience in a way no movies have-- the experience of\ngorgeous art telling a tale in panels that aren't necessarily\nsequential nor do the spell out what's happening in a pedestrian way.<br><br>I'd suspect that Frank Miller would be impressed by this film.<br><br>The action sequences are so well-crafted and presented in such a unique\nway, I was reminded of the feeling I got watching the U-Boat landing in\nthe beginning of \"Saving Private Ryan.\" The difference is that\nSpielberg shot his wad in those first grueling minutes and was unable\nto return to that momentum during the rest of \"Ryan.\" In the case of\n\"Batman Begins,\" Nolan teases us with an ingenious prison fight\nsequence that is actually built upon--even topped--as the movie\nprogresses.<br><br>This is finest E-Ticket ride, a roller-coaster that builds momentum to\na thrilling conclusion that leaves the audience in wild applause. An\nintelligent, complex, brilliantly executed piece of film-making that\njust so happens to present the most authentic picture of the Dark\nKnight we've ever seen. Go ahead, file away that old 1989 copy of Tim\nBurton's \"Batman\"-- there's a new sheriff in town and his name is\nChristopher Nolan.<br><br>It just doesn't get any better than this. Can't wait to see it in IMAX.\n"},
{"review": "\njust got home from seeing batman begins. its the best batman of the\nseries, it has the best batman actor (christian bale), and it is just\nan awesome film!! from start to finish it brilliant, Christopher Nolan\n(a fellow UK person) has pulled off the impossible and best Tim Burtons\nBatman with Michael Keaton, its beat that by miles!! The bat-mobile is\nf**king excellent, the bat suit is brilliant, its has no nipple sh1t,\nits the best! what i think now is forget about the other batman films,\njust let Chris Nolan take batman into his direction, which is the right\ndirection! Christian Bale is excellent as batman, its like he was born\nto be batman, Michael Caine was superb as Alfred (a fellow London\nperson like me), Morgan freeman as luscious fox was just great, the\nwhole cast i just want to say thank you.<br><br>And this film in my opinion is the best film i've seen for years Thank\nyou Chris Nolan and Christian Bale\n"},
{"review": "\nMY ORIGINAL 2005 REVIEW<br><br>'I went to the midnight showing last night, and I've also been to see\nit again this morning, and both times I left feeling thrilled and\nexcited. I've been waiting for this film ever since it was first\nannounced and let me tell you it doesn't let you down one bit. Now I\ndon't want to go through explaining the story, I just want to say how\ngood this film is. It's the best Batman film ever, now I'm a big fan of\nTim Burtons, but after seeing this, I couldn't imagine another Batman\nor another version of Gotham. The film expelled on all levels. I\nremember the anticipation I had before going to see Terminator 3, but\nfelt really let down when I came out. But not this one, I just couldn't\nwait to get in and see it again. So I've been twice already and I'm\nplanning on going again tomorrow morning. I'm going to stop babbling\non, but if you go to see three films this month, go see this first,\nthen star wars and then Mr &amp; Mrs Smith. This is the best film of the\nyear so far and the best comic movie alongside Superman The Movie! PS\nThank god this movie eradicates the camp Joel Schumacher versions. Long\nlive Batman!'<br><br>HOW I FEEL IN 2016<br><br>It's been 11 years since Batman Begins was released in the cinema, and\nsince then we've had The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises,\ncreating one of cinema's all time great trilogies. I've seen this movie\nupwards of 20 times, it's one of those movies that is so good that you\nappreciate it every time you watch it without getting tired of it. It's\nperfectly cast, the action is exhilarating and drama is well written\nand acted. Batman Begins continues to be one of the best superhero\norigin movies out there.\n"},
{"review": "\nHaving seen the screening and witnessing how on the mark this movie is,\nI will be recommending it to anyone who has an interest in Batman.\nEverything from plot to writing to acting to music is bang on. It was\ngreat to see Gary Oldman play a good character instead of an evil one.\nAny movie that has Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and Gary\nOldman is something to see. Christian Bale is perfect as Bruce Wayne as\nhe shows how his character came to be. The music is done by James\nNewton Howard and Hans Zimmer, creating an excellent mix of emotional\nand action scoring. Finally, any worries about Christopher Nolan doing\nan action/adventure are wiped away. Go see this movie!\n"},

{"review": "\nBatman Begins is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made.the\nmovie basically tells the story of the genesis of the caped\ncrusader.obviously,there is a fair amount of character development\ninvolved,which you would expect based on the title.but not so much that\nthe film becomes tedious.Batman is shown as more of a full dimensional\ncharacter than in previous incarnations.this version is also more\nfaithful to the comic.Director Christopher Nolan shows great skill as a\ndirector,pacing the film very well.there are also some touches of\nhumour throughout and we get to see a more human side to Bruce\nWayne.The villains are also more fully realized than in most movies of\nthe genre,instead of simply being devices for the hero(the\nprotagonist)to have a villain(antagonist)to defeat.Gary Oldman and\nMorgan Freeman are standouts in their respective roles,as is Liam\nNeeson.Katie Holmes Has yet to reach the level of maturity require for\nher role,so she is a bit weak.This Batman movie is less cartoonish than\nprevious efforts,and is closer to the realm of realism(relatively\nspeaking)the movie is also more thoughtful than many movies depicting\nsuperheros there is much more substance.in fact more substance than\nstyle,though it is just stylistic enough.All in all a brilliant\ndepiction of the origin of the caped crusader.this movie sets the bar\nhigh for its successor,the Dark Knight,which is to be released sometime\nin 2008. 10/10\n"},

{"review": "\nBy far--the best movie this year--and the best Batman movie ever.\nWhoever had the vision to cast Christian Bale as Batman deserves the\naward of the year. This movie was my introduction to him and the impact\nhe had on me was similar to the impact I felt when I first saw Russell\nCrowe on the screen. What a talented actor! (both of them). The movie\nwas not camp. It was serious and intense and made you almost believe\nthat there could really be a \"Batman\" out there someday. The villains\nwere menacing and nasty without being cartoonish and campy. The\nbackground story on Bruce Wayne was detailed and very welcome. It laid\na strong and credible foundation for everything he did. The other\nactors were also strong in their roles. Morgan Freeman is simply\nirreplaceable. What will we do if and when he retires? And what a\nturn-about role for Gary Oldman! He's another of my favorites. I'll\nnever forget him in Dracula--absolutely superb. But this movie belongs\nto Christian--no doubt about it. Great story, great effects, great\nacting, great package of a movie. Highest recommendation.\n"},

{"review": "\nI went seeing this movie already knowing too much about it. I had read\nthe leaked script almost a year ago. Had avidly followed every news\nabout it. But I was surprised to find the movie to be so fresh for me.<br><br>The biggest strength of the movie is that it is reality based. The\nmovie bases the myth of Batman in a real world. Maybe it demystifies\nbatman a bit too much. But its a very entertaining to watch how they\npull off a believable masked vigilante in a city which could be New\nYork City.<br><br>The cast is impeccable. Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is a study of\nstudy of a troubled should tormented by the anger and despair of not\nbeing able to avenge his parents' mindless murder. His Batman is\ncertainly the most accurate till date. He portrays it like a madman\nlooking who believes that he really is more than human. The support\ncast is fabulous. Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Michael Cain, Gary\nOldman, Tom Wilkinson, Cilian Murphy play the characters so well that I\ntotally bought some of the lines which might sound a little over the\ntop otherwise. Katie Holmes is bearable, she does enough to do justice\nto a well written character. Though I would have preferred the\ncharacter to be Harvey Dent. Cilian's Scarecrow is really creepy.<br><br>The action sequences could have been done better, but still are very\nentertaining. The Batmobile car chase is really thrilling. The fight\nsequences are brutal but a bit too speedily edited.<br><br>The ending leaves you wanting for more. There would surely be sequels.<br><br>The movie really captures the essence of Batman. One of the best lines\nis delivered by Katie Holmes at the end. She says to Bruce something to\nthe effect of \"This is your mask, the real you is Batman\". That to me\nis the essence of the myth that is Batman.\n"},

{"review": "\nNot to be too dramatic but we need a Batman. With all the injustice in\nour government and dark corners of the world, we need to believe that\nthere could be Batman.

You leave the theatre believing in Batman,\nthat you could see Batman saving someone and you see that anyone with\nthe drive and means could be a hero - and thankfully you also see the\nramifications, the human aspect; the cuts and wounds Batman receives on\nBruce Wayne's body and the choices he must make to do what he must. <br><br>I don't agree with comparing this Batman film to Tim Burtons since I\nfeel they are different ideals of Batman and need to be seen as\ndifferent films.

The focus is on Bale the entire time, with the occasional\nbrilliant performances from Oldman, Freeman, Neeson, Caine and Murphy.<br><br>The film is basically split up into two halves: the first is about\nBruce Wayne, the second is about Batman.

{"review": "\nMany wonder why Batman Begins is in the top 100 on IMDb top 250. The\nanswer is simply this: This movie redefined what a summer blockbuster\nshould be like.<br><br>The summer blockbuster before this was supposed to be a mostly an\naction/effect based film with a mix of comedy and drama, however the\nmovie in the end was about and memorable for the action and F/X. Batman\nBegins however, did something different. It had the action, though\nlittle F/X. But it made the dramatic elements of the movie just as\nimportant as the action. The comedy element stayed the same as it\nbefore, thus creating this new genre of film: A dramatic action\nblockbuster.<br><br>Nolan and Bale are the two big people to thank for this new genre.\nNolan direction and Bale acting combined created this genre that made\nyou think about the world and your actions, BUT IT ALSO was a fun film\nthat entertained you and had great one-liners.<br><br>The messages that you learn from this are valuable in life and ones\nmost should follow. They are real.<br><br>However, there is also that fantasy element thrown in this, where your\nmind is suspended in disbelief, such as the batank \"flying on\nrooftops.\" This element is actually necessary to the film. For without\nthis, the film is just this character-drama. And without the other\nelement, the film is just another action-film. But combined, you get\nthis dramatic-action that you just can't help but love because there\nare just too many reasons to love it.<br><br>If you're an \"art house\" guy, you can love the film for the character\ndrama. If you're just a regular movie-goer, you can love it for the\naction. And if you're like me, who is sort of a mix, you can love it\nfor everything as it has everything from all the genres.<br><br>Batman Begins may not be considered to be one of the greatest to most,\nbut most can not deny that this film has redefined what a summer\nblockbuster should be.

{"review": "\nI saw Batman Begins on opening day and let me say WOW. I was very\nimpressed at the way this movie was put together. First I would like to\ngive props to director Christopher Nolan (Memento) for creating such a\nmore believable Batman then its predecessors (B, BR, BF, B&amp;R). I like\nhow the first half of the movie focuses on the character of Bruce Wayne\nand not Batman. This allows viewers to get a more detailed description\nof why he became Batman and his reason for choosing a Bat as his\npersona. The Cast was well assembled having the likes of Christian Bale\n(Bruce Wayne), Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes), and Cillian Murphey (The\nScarecrow). But what made this movie work were the more older veteran\nactors such as Morgan Freeman who plays the helpful Lucius Fox, Rutger\nHauer as power hungry Earle, Liam Neeson as the mysterious Henri\nDucard/Ra's Al ghul , Gary Oldman as the honest Jim Gorden, and Michael\nCaine as the insightful Alfred.

{"review": "\nAfter being disillusioned by just about every comic book \"blockbuster\"\nof recent times, Batman Begins comes as a nice surprise. The film draws\na lot of visual inspiration from Blade Runner and looks all the more\nimpressive for it. The storytelling is done at a decent pace, giving\neach stage just enough time to have an impact before moving on. On the\nacting front Michael Cane as Alfred steals the show serving as the\ncomic relief. Katie Holmes is a bit disappointing but her role is\nlargely forgettable. Christian Bale does an excellent job of\nre-imagining Bruce Wayne, even if he doesn't look quite right with the\nmask on. Just goes to show, with this and Sin City looks like Hollywood\ncan do Comic Books.....\n"},
{"review": "\nconsidering the history of the batman movies you would think that this\nwill be a classic well it is .<br><br>the last batman movie was so bad with George Clonney as the caped\ncrusader and also was so disappointing that it nearly made the whole\nfranchise crumble , but batman is back and blacker than ever this time\nChristian bale is taking up the role and he does a very, well great job\nas the man himself .<br><br>this time the movie focuses on his decent into batman and it is very\nwell told as it is a difficult subject to handle .<br><br>all i will leave you with is that this is a very interesting movie and\nafter star wars the summer time has never been better for big budget\nmovies .\n"},
{"review": "\nI caught this offering on a freeview channel. And at first I began to\nwonder if the listings had got screwed-up. Where was Batman? For a\nseemingly indefinite time, somebody - I suppose it was Bruce Wayne -\nwas faffing about in what I think were the Himalayas. They were\nmountains anyway. There was a bald-headed monk with a self-satisfied\ngaze like a hang-over from Quai Chang Kane's adventures, and Wayne\ngetting the crap kicked out of him frequently. Here, I gather, was\nsupposed to be the 'why he became Batman' expose, but the whole boring\nand verbose pantomime went on for so long that this little grasshopper\ndozed-off before he could grasp the pebble.<br><br>I've awarded 3 ex-gratia stars for whatever I missed because so many\npeople rave about this movie. But judged by the 20 minutes or so of\nwhat I did watch I'd offer no stars at all as it couldn't even sustain\nmy attention enough to keep conscious.<br><br>I would suggest aspiring viewers fast-forward to about halfway through.\nPresumably it livens-up a bit.\n"},
{"review": "\nSuperheroes have been a part of our culture for nearly a century now\nand they have many, and I mean many ardent fans. For some reason I\nnever got into that world nearly as much as others, but from what I do\nknow and what I've seen I can see why they get so much love. Batman,\nbeing one of the more well-known superheroes, became a hit movie series\nin the late 80s and early 90s, but many felt that after 'Batman\nReturns' the series lost it's footing and became too over-the-top and\nsilly. The last one was a critical failure and even though it still\nmade a decent chunk of money, it made less than both it's budget and\nit's predecessors. For eight years there was talk of another, with\nideas ranging from a prequel to a reboot as they like to call it now.\nWhat we got was the latter, which after seeing the film for myself I'd\nsay was exactly what the series needed.<br><br>Pros: A first rate cast. Very nice production design. A good retelling\nof the Batman legend. It's nice to see a Batman film more grounded in\nreality. Stunning photography. An exceptional job from director\nChristopher Nolan, who gives us what may be the smartest and most\ngrown-up Batman movie yet. A memorable score that's at times subtle and\neven somber and fast and exciting at others. Moves at good steady pace,\nwhich starts a bit slow but picks up. Some exciting and well\nchoreographed fight scenes. Also many cool stunts. Some of the best CGI\nwork in recent memory.<br><br>Cons: Maybe a few minutes could have been shaved off the running time.<br><br>Final thoughts: I didn't really know what to expect from this film\nbefore seeing it. Afterwards it didn't matter because I was really\nimpressed. Many comic book related films are just plain silly, which\nisn't always a bad thing, but for this franchise it just didn't work\nand I'm glad it got back on track. Onto 'The Dark Knight' I go! <br><br>My rating: 5/5\n"},
{"review": "\nBatman Begins is actually a very good movie. I thought it would be more\nlike the first Batman from the original four, where it just begins with\nhim already Batman and he just has to fight some villain like the\njoker. This movie, however, delved even deeper in the world of the Dark\nKnight and took some creative liberties that really ended up paying\noff. I especially liked how they depicted the Scarecrow. He was not\nnearly as comic book as he could have been. No, in this movie he was\ngenuinely creepy and seemed like a freak. Batman's relationship with\nRas Al Ghul is also played up very well. Its sort of like the\nrelationship between Magneto and Proffesor x, where they both respect\neach other, they just have differing opinions about how to achieve\ntheir own goals.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt is the first Batman movie I have watched and I must say,I was hugely\nimpressed.Though I have not watched other Batman movies,I can tell that\nthis looks better than those made in the 90's.In a reboot of the\nfranchise,the story starts at the beginning,hence the name of the\ntitle.Christian Bale stars as the titular character,Batman as well as\nhis alter ego,Bruce Wayne.After certain issues in Gotham City that\noccur to Bruce,he leaves and travels the world in search of looking for\nsomething.He encounters a mysterious man by the name of Henri\nDucard(Oscar nominee Liam Neeson in one of his best roles) among\nothers.The cast was great including the likes of Christian Bale,Liam\nNeeson,Michael Caine,Gary Oldman,Morgan Freeman and even Katie\nHolmes.What was also good is the film focused on character and\nstoryline development instead of on just the action and Christopher\nNolan is the man to thank for that as he directed the film and written\nthe screenplay for the film.Watching this today has made me even more\nexcited for the next Batman film,The Dark Knight.Well done to everyone\nwho worked to make this film a great film.\n"},

{"review": "\nI was so surprised when I first saw this film simply because I thought\nit was going to be another stupid Batman movie...boy was I wrong.<br><br>When I saw that Christopher Nolan had directed this film I got pretty\nexcited because I had seen his previous movies and was a big fan; I\nespecially enjoyed \"Memento\". With already one good thing to this\nmovie, I figured why not check it out. I love the darkness of this\nfilm. It's a different take on the series and it works very well. The\ndarkness of the story, the characters, and everything else. I also\nreally liked how Nolan showed the origins of Bruce Wayne and how he\neventually became what he was destined to be, it was just great.<br><br>The acting is superb. Especially Christian Bale as Batman; he pulled it\noff very well and is probably one of the best Batman in the\nlong-running series. Cillian Murphy is very good as the villain.\nMichael Caine is good as Alfred and he and Bale have good chemistry in\nthe film making it all the more believable.<br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed this film and I can't wait to see The Dark\nKnight.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is one of those few films that amaze you on pretty much every\nlevel and thats the truth.<br><br>From the directors point of view, it must have been pretty hard for him\nto try and clean up the mess from some of the previous films but Nolan\ndoes it flawlessly. He is able make a film about Bruce's journey to\nbecoming Batman which is sort of makes this film about redemption which\nadds to the power of the film.<br><br>The acting is some of the best I have ever seen. Christian Bale, Liam\nNeeson, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Tom Wilkinson all give\nstunning performances but Cillian Murphy nearly steels the film with an\nincredibly scary performance which I hope he continues to do in the\nDark Knight.<br><br>This is beautifully well made film that can appeal to new and old\nBAtman fans and to those who aren't fans at all. The best Batman film\nat the moment which covers new darker ground but the way film is more\nabout redemption leaves you feeling at the end that this is no ordinary\nsuper hero film.\n"},

{"review": "\nI became a fan of Christopher Nolan after watching this film because he\nhas just changed the way superhero movies were made till now. He gives\nthe movie a dark look and a realistic look too. With excellent\ndirection there are top notch acting skills shown by Christen Bale. He\nexcels as batman on all ways.Surely all the other movies made on batman\nlook a piece of crap if you watch batman begins because surely this is\nwhat batman needed in his beginning.The thing that is good about this\nmovie is that batman is shown according to his getup i mean what do you\nexpect from batman he is the most serious super hero in town boys which\nwere not able to see in the other batman flicks.<br><br>I am waiting for the sequel of batman \"THE DARK KNIGHT\" and i know i\nwont be disappointed.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Dark Knight is coming out soon so I thought as a tribute I should\nreview the previous outing. I have been a fan of the Batman movies ever\nsince the first Batman(1989)came out when I was four. Viewing it now I\ncould not believe that I actually loved it once, it is an overrated\npiece of tripe. Oh well enough about the first one Batman Begins is\nwonderful,I would call it better than the original. I only viewed it\nfor the first time after I purchased the DVD and from the first few\nreels I was hooked. Batman is a welcome return for one of my favourite\nsuperheroes after some pretty awful outings. Batman Forever was OK but\nBatman and Robin was shameful and an embarrassment to fans of Batman.\nChristopher Nolan is rather good,Micheal Caine is good as Alfred,Gary\nOldman was good but Katie Holmes disappointed. BB tells the story of\nBruce Wanye before he became Batman, which I found fascinating to find\nout. At the end there is a reference to Joker,Jack Nicolson played him\nin the first Batman and Heath Ledger(may he rest in peace)will be\nplaying him in The Dark Knight. Batman Begins has put the franchise\nback on track after it derailed.\n"},
{"review": "\nBatman is back and he means business. That's a very cheesy way to start\nthis review, but it's a fitting one. I loved the Burton Batmans mostly\nbecause I'm a big Burton fan and a was a moderate Batman fan. AFter\nseeing all the junk that Schumacher had made and basically ruined this\nfranchise, people were waiting for the best comic book here to make a\nreturn. The Bat nipples, poor choices for Batman and overdone villains\nruined every Batman movie up until Begins. Bale is hands down the best\nBatman as he has the style and posture of the Bat. Please, do yourself\na favor and watch this movie. I only felt like I had to write this\nreview in order to get people pumped for The Dark Knight.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was first introduced to \"Batman\" when I saw the Tim Burton film in\n1997. I immediately loved the hero; he became my favorite because\nBatman, like Indiana Jones, represents the real heroes of today, the\nones without superpowers who are just as human as you and I.<br><br>I then saw \"Batman Returns,\" which was alright. It didn't serve my\nexpectations like the first one did, but it was alright.<br><br>Then I saw \"Batman Forever,\" and the franchise started getting campy,\nand the writing started to suck, and the actor for Batman just got\nworse. But that didn't stop! Then came \"Batman and Robin,\" which was\none of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. George\nClooney, as good as he is, is no Batman. It all seemed to go downhill\nfrom here until...Christopher Nolan! Christopher Nolan resurrects the\nfranchise with this fantastic reboot! He even chooses a perfect Batman\nwith Christian Bale. One other thing that I liked about it was how it\nfocused entirely on Batman and not on the bad guys like the first four\ndid. Liam Neeson was also very good in it as Henri Ducard aka Ra's Al\nGhul. Christopher Nolan also reminds us why we like Batman: because of\nhis humanity and because of the fact that he's just so damn cool! I\nwelcome \"The Dark Knight\" with open arms entirely. Kudos to Christopher\nNolan!\n"},
{"review": "\nBatman Begins blows Tim Burton/Shumacher movies COMPLETELY out of the\nwater and hands down the best superhero movie I've ever seen...period.\nIt's got it all; action, comedy, drama, suspense and fantasy brought\ntogether so eloquently by Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Prestige)\nalong with tight direction, cinematography, and astounding special\neffects with a sense of verisimilitude so strong and effective\nthroughout it comes together in a stellar package. And Christian Bale\nis simply superb in the role; making Batman dark and brooding, the way\nhe should be. Many have criticized Katie Holmes, but I liked her in\nthis film (especially in Pieces of April, Abandon, The Gift). The\nvillains also get top billing and are far more menacing and three\ndimensional than before. The original movies were good in their day but\nthey pale in comparison to what Nolan and co brought to the big screen\nbecause staying true to the source material pays off and is more\nengrossing in the end. Some superhero movies have tried to go the other\nway around resulting in failure but this film nailed it spot on. My\nmain complaint is the fight scenes were too heavily edited. Hopefully\nthey will be fleshed out in the next film. I enjoyed Spider-Man and\nX-Men and their sequels (except the third installments) and Iron Man\nrespectively but Batman will always be my favorite superhero and with\nthe sequel approaching this summer, it's gonna be one hell of a treat.\n"},
{"review": "\nBatman Begins is one of the best films of 2005, if not the best. I had\nmy doubts before seeing this. Shumacher was basically a flop, but after\na couple minutes viewing this film, my thoughts instantly changed. The\nmovie starts when Bruce Wayne was a little child, and leads to when he\nmastered his fears and became Batman. Christopher Nolan did a very good\njob directing this film. He had a Burton-like sense of how things\nshould make you feel. This film was dreary-feeling, but in a good way.\nThe acting was outstanding. Christian Bale was a good fit for Batman.\nThe rest of the cast includes greats like Morgan Freeman, Michael\nCaine, Katie Holmes, and Liam Neeson. The score was memorable. The\nscript could've been no better. Also, the visual effects was\noutstanding. It seems like that these things were real. I definitely\nrecommend this movie. I give this film a 10/10.\n"},

Most of the actors in the last saga were\neither a good Bruce Wayne, or a good Batman, and Christian Bale pulled\nboth off. Other than him, the rest of the cast was amazing, every\nsingle person, i cannot pick someone in the film who wasn't\noutstanding.<br><br>Story- What made this Films story different from almost all superhero\nmovies, is that it wasn't just that a Bad guy is causing trouble and\nthe superhero has to save the day, Batman Begins showed his journey to\nbecoming the hero, and in a very detailed manor. The Villain wasn't an\naverage bad guy either, and i won't tell you who he was because i don't\nwant to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it.<br><br>All I can really say is that if you have not seen this film, than you\ntruly are missing out.

{"review": "\nChristopher Nolan is already proving to be one of the very best\ndirectors, with films such as The Prestige and of course, Memento. Then\nthere's this, Batman Begins. There are many things that make this one\nof the best ever comic book adaptations. The dark musical score, along\nwith snapshots of Bruce Wayne's childhood are great accompaniments,\nshowing Bruce Wayne's dark nature of anger and guilt, where most\nsuperheros are just being shown to show how good will always triumph\nover evil. Here Bruce Wayne is shown as a normal man (apart from being\namazingly rich!) with huge personal problems, and the film shows how he\ntriumphs over his own insecurities.<br><br>The best thing about Batman Begins though, is that Batman is not\nactually shown as a superhero, as he doesn't actually have any\nsuperhuman powers (such as flying etc.), he is shown as a man with a\npoint to prove to himself, and he believes that only by \"turning fear\nagainst those who prey on the fearful\", he can prove himself. The high\ntech gadgetry and Bruce's ninja training are fantastically done to show\nwhere Bruce got his inspiration to become Batman, and learnt his\nskills. Nolan has used the fact that Bruce is a billionaire where no\none has before, showing how he uses his money to create his fearsome\nalter ego - buying wires to suspend himself from, weapons, his cave and\na new-look batmobile.<br><br>The fight scenes are really good, Batman flying from all angles - its\nreally cool! Christopher Nolan really is a genius director, here he has\nmade a film which for the first time has shown that a hero such as\nBatman could exist in real life. 10/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI've seen all of Batman movies and they were OK at best and sometimes\nawful .. I nearly lost hope of this series but when I heard that Nolan\nis directing the next Batman .. I braced myself to a very good movie at\nleast and Nolan hasn't let me down .. it is the only Batman movie that\nyou could call a masterpiece even people who liked it less consider it\na very good movie and the best batman (so far). This movie is loaded\nwith class A starts (like other batman movies) but they are the best of\nthe best .. Liam Neeson &amp; Michael Caine were very good .. Morgan\nFreeman wasn't at his best but he was OK at least .. Christian Bale is\na unique actor and I think he will show us great performance in other\nmovies to come in the future .. he is the type of actor he will try\neverything and anything that makes his performance good .. keep in mind\nhis awesome performance in \"The Machinist\" .. he has a great facial\nexpresses that he uses very good .. Gary Oldman wasn't very good but\nwasn't bad either .. Cillian Murphy also was very good .. even Katie\nHolmes was good. The visual effects were convening and were so\nrealistic that sometimes I feel that they didn't use much of computer\neffects. What can I say about this masterpiece !! in short, Christopher\nNolan worked hardly on this movie and he surely has lifted it up to the\nmasterpiece level .. everything sounds prefect in this movie. Do not\nmiss it .. <br><br>it is one of the best in 2005 and absolutely the best batman movie (so\nfar) .. I hope Nolan is directing the next batman so I enjoy it as much\nas I enjoyed Batman Begins.\n"}
