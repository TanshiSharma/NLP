{"review": "\nThough director Spike Jonze collaborated with Charlie Kaufman on Being\nJohn Malkovich and Adaptation, the latter didn't have a hand in Jonze's\nassured, moving fourth feature, but his spirit\u0097fiendishly inventive,\ncasually postmodern, self-lacerating, fearless, funny, and ultimately\ndeeply sad\u0097pervades the film. With Her, Jonze beautifully realizes a\nfuture Los Angeles where a lovesick man (Joaquin Phoenix) in the midst\nof a devastating divorce is so desperate for intimacy that he falls\nhopelessly in love with an artificially intelligent operating system,\nvoiced by Scarlett Johansson. Jonze's screenplay acknowledges the\ninnate absurdity of the film's premise while spinning it into an\nelegant, heartbreaking depiction of human loneliness and the innate\nneed for connection. For the setting, Jonze plugged into the current\nera's technological mania to say something timeless and profound about\nlove, loss, and evolving desire.\n"},
{"review": "\nJust finished watching Spike Jonze's new movie 'Her', a beautiful,\ntender, melancholy film about love and loss and technology. It's that\nkind of science fiction so close to science fact you can almost look\nout your window and see it, so in that it's of a piece with Jonze's\nfirst movie 'Being John Malkovich', though the cautious, bruised and\ndrifting heart of it reminds me most of (his ex-wife) Sofia Coppola's\n'Lost In Translation'.<br><br>It's funny: just last month I was saying how 2013 was not such a good\nyear for movies and then 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' came along, and now\nthis, which I think is probably the best of the year.<br><br>This is an amazing, unique, magical film that I would recommend to\neveryone, with the caveat that it almost certainly will make you go\n'ouch', at least if you're paying attention. But I'm pretty sure that\nyou won't have seen anything quite like it before.\n"},

Actually that's not true - about the only vaguely\ninteresting thing that happens is when his computer gets him a book\ndeal, but even then that just gets dropped - they don't do anything\nwith it, except he unwraps his new book. There are side characters but\nthey don't have stories either. Guy he works with gets a lawyer\ngirlfriend and they go on a date. Best friend Any dumps her husband\nover a row about her shoes.

OK, so the cinematography and soundtrack etc. are\ntotally unoffensive, but in my opinion, it is grossly over-acted,\nincluding the OT's childish whining. (\"Oh-ka-aaaaay.\") Their\nconversations sound like a dialogue piece written by a high school kid\nfor homework and the delivery of it all is just so.... fake.

Lovers from friends,\nfriends from lovers? Letters for strangers of love and romance? Alone,\nnot alone, moody blues and then quickstep on the floor? This is just\nthe surface, like the first chapter of the physics book, the real thing\nstarts in all of us, every day. Sometimes I really liked the film for\nits extreme sensitivity and apprehension of reverberations of human\nemotions, then I was really upset by its clever fall and emotional\nbreakdown.

The director has\na great sense of art, and has utilized it to take the movie to the next\nlevel.<br><br>Ultimately, nothing can replace the warmth of a human being, and this\nmessage has been given excellently in the film.

{"review": "\nI think this movie is odd. It really is creepy. But since it was a\nmovie, there's an actor, script, edit, and everything, it is incredibly\nodd. I'm very impressed by Phoenix. He captured an anti-social creepy\nguy really well that I think this movie is odd. Great act. His\nrelationship with the OS feels incredibly real that Samantha is like an\nactual person who's in a distance relationship with Theodore. Great\nactors and actress. Actress like Scarlett Johansson and Kristen Bell\nare also participated just for the voice. Pretty nice realistic future\nedit and people talking with their own OSes in the background is\nsomething, and the conflict of what his friends' thought about his\nrelationship, making it looks more realistic et ceteras.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis the best 2014 romance film, for all its components, photography,\nplot, cast, and soundtrack, it's just fantastic! To support, the film\nmoves away and out of a traditional fairy tale, where everything is\nalways perfect and wonderful, even having a futuristic theme is very\nclose to our reality. The film's plot brings something that is\ninnovative to my point of view, by be a novel high quality with male\nprotagonist, not the stereotypical man, but a modern man, with all his\ncomplexity and problems both romantic, professional and emotional I\nrecommend to men and women because it brings a reflection for all on\nthe demystification of men emotions.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a good movie about our life, our new life our modern and post\nmodern world! in general opinion this movie can see terrible side of\nthe deep of technology in out life. This is a magic and beautiful\n\"virtual\" world, but this can be terrible in a real life. At the\nbeginning of the film we see that movie begins with a vision of virtual\nlife in a real life; insomnia, but at the end of the movie we back to\nour real life a real touch sense and we can feel the body heat. I think\nthis story was really good, but the end of the story, I didn't think.\nAnyway You most see this movie, even again, and focus on details that\nyou can't see in the first time.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe advance press for UNDER THE SKIN, by virtue of playing\nnone-too-subtly upon the presence in the film of Scarlett Johansson in\na state of undress, has prompted me to revisit my thoughts on Spike\nJonze's HER, which I didn't manage to set down when first I saw it.\nJohansson, of course, plays the voice of a virtual lover who never\ntakes visual form. What I think is brilliant about Jonze's film is\nprecisely the way in which he exploits the recognizability of that\nvoice, the fact that it is known to be Johansson's, and that Johansson,\nwho is a very fine actor, is also an acknowledged sex symbol.<br><br>I say that she never takes visual form, but actually, of course, she\ndoes, in the mind's eye. And not just in her screen boyfriend's\n(Joaquin Phoenix) but in that of anyone in the audience for whom the\nvoice calls up objectified images of the unseen but familiar Johansson\n(it is surely no accident that the pronoun of the title is an object\nrather than a subject).

{"review": "\nGreat concept but not so great on the execution. Good performances by\nthe cast and and quality production values couldn't make up for the\nflaws. I really appreciated what the intentions were behind the story,\nbut why was it told in such a lifeless way? The two big problems are\nthe slow pace of the film and the almost total lack of any sense of\nhumor. About 45 minutes in I was about ready to tune out. My mind\nstarted to drift as there wasn't enough substance to sustain the plot.\nEditing out about thirty minutes would have helped a lot. The bigger\nsin is the dry, lifeless presentation. Why Spike Jonze decided to make\nthis a humorless endeavor baffles me. All the wit exhibited in his\nprevious films was missing here. The second half had a few twists that\nsave it from being a total loss. It seems like such a wasted\nopportunity to make cutting social commentary on our device obsessed\nculture.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt is engagingly self-aware and excruciatingly self-conscious, wearing\nits hipness on its sleeve; it's ingenious and yet remarkably contrived.\nThe film seems very new, but the sentimental ending is as old as the\nhills. There are some great moments. it is the best kind of science\nfiction, the kind that reflects the world we live in right now. Jonze\nisn't judging our addiction to phones and other technology, he's\nexamining it, and in the examination he finds the ways these things\nmake us better. In the end Her comes down strongly on the side of human\ncontact, but it feels in some ways like the first salvo in post-human\nempathy. Or maybe it's the most human thing of all, understanding that\ntrue love is between minds and not bodies.\n"},

{"review": "\nOne impressive film, worth watching. I think that one thing I liked the\nmost was the fact that although the plot is about a love story, the\nmanner in which it is presented is innovative, not a \"cliche\" with\nwhich we are used to deal almost all the time on the screens. Nowadays,\nlove is restricted to some limits: some of them, of course, regards\nphysical contact. In order to change the public's opinion and way of\nview about what real love is and how it makes us react, this film shows\nthe love story between a man, who is lonely after divorcing his wife,\nand a computerized system which can perform the actions of a real human\nbeing. Maybe the skeptical ones will not be interested in seeing it,\nbut I am sure that no matter what your preferences are like, if you\nenjoy seeing or reading about love, you will enjoy watching \"Her\".\nAmazing film.

{"review": "\nDirected and written by Spike Jonze, Her is one of the best movies of\nthe year. Joaquin Phoenix plays a divorced man who falls in love with\nhis operating system. On surface it sounds laughable and a bit creepy,\nyet that couldn't be farther from the truth. Joaquin delivers the\nperformance of his career with such innocence and melancholy that we\ncan actually see the beauty in this relationship. Scarlett Johansson\nvoices Samantha, the advanced operating system, and does an equally\nmagnificent job. The fact that we never saw her in the movie is a\ncredit to her, and should open the possibility of a voice acting award\nat the Oscars. This movie portrays a futuristic atmosphere with\nstunning cinematography, no so much that its feels unfamiliar, but\nenough to stimulate our imaginations. The script is the best of the\nyear, and that's saying something.

{"review": "\nA very odd tale of love and technology. Not necessarily in that order.\nBut while this is a very odd movie, it also is very nicely told. It\ntakes its time and while you might wish there was more personality\nbehind our main actor, it is obviously meant that the \"other\" voice\n(Scarlett having a very recognizable voice if you're watching this in\nthe original language and not dubbed) has more juice and more almost\neverything than the actual human being.<br><br>The pacing is slow, but you should know and expect this from this\n\"romance\" (if you want to call it that). The thing is, that this movie\nis not condemning technology. Technology is made by humans, so if it is\nanyone who is to blame one way or another, it's the person using the\ntechnology. Now please no analogies with weapons, that is not what I\nmeant. Different beast here and no connection whatsoever with this\nmovie. Enjoy this trip with some very interesting ideas\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's called \"Her\" but actually it's all about him - Theodore, a\nprofessional writer of personal letters for those who can't find the\nwords to express their emotions, played by Joaquin Phoenix in a\nunderstated performance a million miles from his appearance in\n\"Gladiator\". Theodore is rarely off the screen and Phoenix does well to\nhold the movie for a full two hours.<br><br>There are three 'hers' in this original work, both written and directed\nby Spike Jonze.

{"review": "\nI have watched Her, directed by Spike Jonze recently. I chose to watch\nthis film coz I have watched his previous work Being John Malkovich,\nwhich is a little bit weird but full of surprises. My first impression\nof the film was \"wow, what a story!\" I was totally moved by the acting\nof Joaquin Phoenix and of course Scarlett's sexy voice. The movie is\nactually about a lonely man falls in love with his operating system\nwith a female voice. I remember the part when Theodore had sex with\nSamantha, this plot is totally innovative and exciting for the\naudience, and the whole movie interprets the relationship between\npeople as technology gets more advanced is so precise. For what I see,\nthe movie tries to bring out the idea that we have to have faith in\nfinding love, love is everywhere, even 'system' like Samantha has her\nown feeling and dares to find her true love through communicating with\ndifferent 'humans'. On the whole, the film really surprised me in terms\nof storyline and the whole new interpretation of relationship.\n"},

Overall I thought the movie was stretched\nout a little too long.<br><br>Of course the OS's voice drew a lot of praise, and the actress is very\nendearing as a lover. At one point, when they go on a double date, I\nthink there was an unintended Man-With-Two-Brains feel to the\nrelationship.

{"review": "\nWith most movies you need to supply a bit of \"suspended disbelief\", and\n\"Her\" is no exception. From a technical point of view, it is hard to\nimagine an OS as sophisticated (and sexy), right out of the box. Not so\nhard to imagine a mal-adjusted techhie, but more than once his\nirritating personality merits a two-by-four upside the head.\nSurprisingly impressive is Johansson's expertly delivered dialog. Given\nScarlett's looks, the viewer is justifiably focused on her in other\nmovies, more so than on her delivery. Amy Adams is entirely convincing\nas a nerdy girl - right down to the semi-vapid look in her eyes. The\nplot is sort of believable, but decidedly disappointing in the vague\nand unresolved ending. Maybe in some circles this is considered\ncreative, but in my view Jonze just couldn't come up with a good,\nsatisfying conclusion.\n"},
