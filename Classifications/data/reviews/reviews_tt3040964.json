{"review": "\nWhen I went to see this movie I kept thinking about how great was the\ncartoon movie with all its extravagant and funny characters: Balu, the\nelephants, even evil characters like Kaa (the snake) were fun to watch.\nHow could I even forget a minor character like the vultures, and their\njokes on Shere Khan? Their humor was great in contrast with the tiger's\nego. I thought I would revive all those memories watching this movie. I\nwas wrong.<br><br>This movie is lacking of various things. First, a good plot. Second,\ngood characters with relevant appearances. Third, humour (nonexistent\nif we ignore Balu) and a good atmosphere for songs (is this supposed to\nbe a musical?). And fifth but not least, WHAT IS KING KONG DOING IN\nKING LOUI'S TEMPLE?? What they have done to that poor monkey is\nunbearable.<br><br>MY SUMMARY(SPOILERS):<br><br>King Loui doesn't dance. Shere Kahn doesn't bother to chase Mogli\nthrough the jungle. Why would him anyway? He already knows the plot.\nKaa's appearance in the movie is what in Spanish we call \"postureo\". He\nappears once. He narrates Mowgli's origins to the spectator (how plot\nconvenient...). He tries to eat the kid with no success and fades away\nto live happily ever after. The rest can be summarized in: f*ck logic.\nI have been walking for two days to get to the human village, and now I\ncan just run away for 10 minutes with a torch in hand to get just where\nthe movie started. Hi, my name is Mowgly and I like to burn down\njungles in my free time (appaluse). AH AND THE VULTURES DON'T EVEN\nSPEAK IN THE WHOLE MOVIE, SAME AS THE ELEPHANTS which are considered\ngods among the other animals (wtf) and magically appear in the last\nscene to save the day.<br><br>Please re watch the old movie instead of wasting your money in this\nthing.

{"review": "\nThe Jungle Book is a live-action/CGI fantasy film that retells the\nstory of Mowgli, an orphaned human boy who, guided by his animal\nguardians, sets out on a journey of self-discovery while evading the\nthreatening Shere Khan. Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli in\nthe movie. He is the only human being on screen and as his first ever\nrole, this kid actor is truly magnificent. He is as good as any kid\nactor has ever been, even favorably compared to Haley Joel Osment in\nThe Sixth Sense. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all\nthroughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind\nblowing. In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at\njust how amazing the CGI and 3D were. I think the main reason as to why\nthis movie worked it's because it also has a very good story line\nthat's mixed in with the amazing visuals. Also, the voice actors are\nall perfectly cast. Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly\nhaunting in every scene he's in. That was one well made and scary\nvillain that Mowgli had to face. Jon Favreau did a fantastic work with\nthis movie, cause really this story has been told many times before,\nand yet this movie feels fresh and interesting nonetheless. I'm glad\nthat it's doing so well in Box Office because it completely deserves\nit. Movies like this must be appreciated so that they can inspire more\ngreat work, and maybe one day, even erase movies like Transformers.\n"},
{"review": "\nafter seeing this could not believe the reviews, the film was bad, bad\nand bad. the kid playing mowgli has to be the worst child actor i have\never seen, terrible voice, one gormless expression throughout the film,\nhe could not convey joy, sadness or fear. the film looked fuzzy and\nwashed out all the way through. all the voices were flat and un\nemotional, great actors as bill murray and christopher walken sounded\nlike they were on valium. not a patch on the animated version or the\nkorda version and not remotely close to Disney's own previous live\naction retelling of the story that stephen somers directed with an\nolder mowgli brilliantly played by jason scott lee. the film had no\ndepth, emotion or character to it. the script was clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9.\nthere was no life in any part of it, no pace just seemed to go through\ntired set ups. as for it having an ecological message, we could not see\nor find it anyway or anytime during the film.\n"},

{"review": "\nIt is mediocre attempt to try to fit the fictional anachronistic\noriginal \"jungle book\" to a more realistic context. The visual effects\nin the movie are very nice, but that's it because the story lacks\nsubstance. There is a sense of emptiness in the movie that makes you\nwish for more without getting it. The story is not good for children 5\n- 10, given the violence, nor for adults given the lack of\nplausibility. Something that bothered me was that the in the movie,\nproducers made a lot of effort in presenting the animals realistically\nbut their roughness and strong presence contrasted so much with the\nvery delicate and unrealistic nature of the boy actor.

{"review": "\n17 April 2016 Film of Choice Tonight at The Plaza Dorchester - The\nJungle Book. Apart from films set in space this has to be one of the\nmost amazing uses of CGI I have seen to date. What a visual assault we\nwere treated to. The jungle in all its glory, never sleeping, never\nquiet, and always with a surprise around the corner. This latest Disney\noffering, a live action (mostly CGI) remake of its 1967 story of\nRudyard Kipling's jungle book was epic. It took the tale of Mowgli, the\nman cub and presented it to us in a whole new format. The animals were\nall very realistic, yet very true to the animated versions we know and\nlove. There were many moments I recognised yet many new ones slotted in\neffortlessly to the story. A line up of huge talent provided the\nvoices, from Scarlett Johansson as Kaa the snake, Ben Kingsley as\nBagheera the panther, Idris Elba as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the\nbear was voiced wonderfully by Bill Murray. Although there were a few\ntense moments which made me jump this is a great film for all the\nfamily to enjoy.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhile I prefer the older animation (8), this is still worth your time.\nThe CGI is impressive &amp; Mowgli interacts well with the animals. It is\nmore serious in tone, making the lighter moments and obligatory songs\nout of place. I was pleased that the wolves and Shere Khan got more\nscreen time. The cubs and the baby elephant are adorable. I wasn't keen\non the re-imagined Baloo and King Louie. (Although, Phil Harris &amp; Louis\nPrima would be impossible to impersonate.) The elephants, monkeys and\nvultures don't have speaking roles. Bagheera and Shere Khan are the\nstrongest characters. Kaa is now female and she is given a significant\nscene. The ending is different. Mowgli is given a more active role.\nSome nods to The Lion King. It might not be suitable for\nyounger/sensitive children. I liked that they included some of the\ninstrumentals from the classic. A good, alternative version.\n"},

When Baloo and Bagheera\nstand at the edge of the jungle and watch Mowgli save a baby elephant\nto the tune of The Bare Necessities, the familiar song floats on a\nsweet and somber note. They know he's becoming a man - and the tender\nversion of the tune compliments what we're seeing on screen; We see the\nbittersweet realization (and the pride) in the faces of the animals.\nThis is sublime perfection; a perfect marriage of music and the\nartists' emotional brushstrokes.<br><br>That scene alone is worthy of a five-hanky movie status - but the\ncreators of this version of The Jungle Book treat every scene with\ngreat affection and respect. Each shot is beautifully framed. Any given\nframe is a glorious masterpiece in color and composition. In the book\nworld we would give a Caldecott Award to such artistic achievement. I\nonly hope the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences will recognize\nthis beautiful piece of work when it's time to nominate the Oscar\nfilms.<br><br>Finally, the direction skillfully weaves the beauty and wonder of the\njungle world and the humor of growing up - while also sending us on a\nheart-pounding tale of revenge.<br><br>Director/Producer Jon Favreau and his team got it right. <br><br>Bravo.\n"},

The thing that I liked the most about the\nmovie were the scenes where the bear would sing- it was actually\nentertaining.

{"review": "\nI would make a confession that I have never read the Jungle Book as a\nkid and the only memories of Jungle Book I had was seeing the cartoon\nin India in Hindi.

Also, the only story of Kipling I\nread in school was Kim which I felt was touching.<br><br>Technically, Jungle Book is a brilliant film.

There is a lot of blood and gore in this film.<br><br>Also, Favreau's interpretation of the story is a bit strange. He\nprojects the movie as sort of revenge drama between Shere Khan and\nMowgli.

Despite King\nLouie and Kaa's roles being dimmed down a bit, it's all for good\nreason.<br><br>There were few things that bothered me in the movie. For one, Bare\nNecessities was done very well and I couldn't stop smiling the entire\ntime, but King Louie singing I Want To Be Like You didn't fit with the\nmonkey that was portrayed in this film. Another was Baloo's and\nMowgli's relationship. It went from being reluctant to best friend so\nfast, I didn't have time to think. The bear almost took the kid\ninstantly, yet a few minutes earlier it seemed like he was just using\nhim This all fades away once we see how good they are for each other,\nand how much the bear cares for the kid.<br><br>All in all, this is an amazing remake, which is quite rare in the film\nbusiness, and it doesn't matter if you've read the book, seen the 1967\nanimated original, done both or neither. You will enjoy watching this\nmovie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw Jungle Book as a child 40 years ago and although I remember\nliking it I don't remember being as entertained as I was for this one.\nBrought my 10 year old son to this one. We both thoroughly enjoyed the\nfilm. The kid that played Mowgli was very well cast. A few scary\nmoments for kids 6 and under. Not a strong story but the\ncharacters..mainly Mowgli, Baloo the bear, and Bagheera the black\npanther were very likable. My only criticism is the same criticism I\nhave for most animated films...and that is, do we really need\ncelebrities as voices in EVERY single film? I just don't understand why\nthis is necessary. Maz Kanata and Gustavo Fring as a wolf and Peter\nVenkman as a bear? It really doesn't add anything to the film.\n"},

So, it's a must watch\nfor all Mowgli lovers\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Jungle Book is a marvel to behold. The special effects are\nwonderful and the animals look fantastic.<br><br>There are positives and negatives to the movie though: it will scare\nchildren - there is no doubt about that. It is more frightening to\nwatch someone that looks life-like in a battle over watching cartoon\ncharacters. The story is a bit boring at times and makes the movie feel\nlonger than it actually is.<br><br>Ben Kingsley is wonderful as Bagheera and he actually breathes more\nlife into the character than the original cartoon. Idris Elba is\nmenacing as Shere Khan and I felt that he made Khan more of a villain\nthan the cartoon had done. Christopher Walken just steals the show -\nhis King Louie has that same impact that was in the original movie.\nWalken was marvelous as Louie and his character was the best part of\nthe entire movie.<br><br>Neel Sethi was a bit wooden as Mowgli, but he is acceptable in the role\nand does not bring the movie down - he also is not interesting enough\nto make you care about his character as you should to have the full\nimpact. Bill Murray is alright as Baloo, but he misses the charm and\nfun that Phil Harris brought to the character. I felt that the movie\ndid not flesh Baloo out enough and allow his playfulness that made his\nso likable and unforgettable in the cartoon. Scarlet Johansson is\nwasted in the role of Kaa. Kaa (Sterling Holloway) had such a presence\nin the cartoon that this version missed. There was so much more that\nthey could have done with Kaa, but it felt like that part of the film\nwas either edited or rushed.<br><br>Overall it was a good film and entertaining to fans of the Jungle Book.\n"},
{"review": "\nSeriously this movie is all about bashing on Khan. Even Kaa doesn't\nseem to get this much attention. By the way, Kaa is cheap made and his\npart is uninspiring. Maybe he didn't had enough connections. He looks\nlike some cheap Chinese toy that you get from a store full with pink\nplastic toys that make noise.<br><br>Baloo. Argh, why did they scraped his character too? He is a central\ncharacter, but his fur looks ugly, his face is bland, and his amusing\ntemper from the book sounds here like a soaked chicken.<br><br>And.. the countdown arrives to Louie. Like what? Never seen this\ngigababoon before. What is he eating anyway? Maybe a couple of fellow\nchimps a day? Cause he's surely not on a Kellogs cornflakes diet. The\nthing is scary and his face looks as animated as a 15 plastic surgery\n50 years old model.<br><br>By the way, check out about going with 5 years old kids.

Back in 2012 we were stunned by the\ntiger in \"Life of Pi\" - the jaw dropping creation of special effects\nteam. In \"The Jungle Book\" you will see the same level special effects\nin almost every scene - these animal are as stunningly real as it gets.\nThis is by far the best looking film of 2016.

Why would they do that? Baloo doesn't\nlook like a realistic bear at all, not saying that's bad, he looks\npretty cool actually and has good acting. On the other side we have\nBagheera and Shere Khan, now those two look realistic and without any\nsort of personality, the only good thing about them are the voices. But\nthey look terrible next to Baloo. <br><br>Then we have some other characters like Raksha and Gray that look\ngood-ish, not as good as Baloo, not as bad as Bagheera.

But he looks like a really huge though and\nangry animal that somehow starts to sing a happy song for a very short\nperiod of time, it's simply weird. The way he acts doesn't make a lot\nof sense.<br><br>And the elephants... they are simply elephants. Not a single thing is\ninteresting about them.<br><br>Now, the problem with this is that some animals look very realistic,\nothers don't, the ones that don't look that realistic look way better\nand are great to watch.

{"review": "\nFavreau's Jungle Book is a marvel. With a Spielbergian sense of magical\nawe and reverent fear, it's a children's epic that not only stands-up\nto its legacy, but surpasses it. Giant snakeskins, intense animal\nbattles, and daring escapes from ape kingdoms give the film a scope\nbeyond the animated musical, all while keeping intact its persistent\njoy. Funny, jaw-dropping, thrilling, grand, and fun, it's an\nall-cylinders-go cinematic experience on every level. The story of a\nyoung man-cub raised by wolves and living amongst the animals of the\njungle hasn't changed much, down to the talking beasts. Much like last\nyear's Cinderella, they utilize nostalgia of the beloved product to\ndive deeper into the story without cynically dismissing it. On top of\nimmersing us into the wilderness through meticulous attention to the\nsmallest of details, the characters are drawn with much more depth. The\nbratty and paper-thin Mowgli of yesteryear is replaced by a boy with\nbrains and motivation. Played with wide-eyed confidence by newcomer\nSethi, we emotionally engage with his adventure. And he's not alone;\nall characters are given loving attention, specifically the foreboding\npresence of scary-cool bruiser Sheer Khan. The technical feat of\ncreating photo-realistic animals that convincingly speak and emote is\nso impressive it feels like a benchmark in CGI. It wouldn't be an\noverstatement to say this is as groundbreaking and beautiful as any\nvisual effects in years. Favreau and co. manage intense attention to\naccuracy without shoving it down our throats or overshadowing the\nstory. At the end of the day, under all the computer data, there is a\nsoulful and entertaining tale about life's bare necessity:\nindividuality within community.\n"},

It appears that the producers\nnever quite made up their minds about whether this was to be a musical\nversion or not. As a result, the crummy songs come jarringly out of\nnowhere.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am both an enthusiast of the 1967 Disney animated Jungle Book and\nRudyard Kipling's novel. Upon viewing this new rendition of this movie,\nI was not impressed. I was very much hoping it would be closer to\nKipling's Jungle Book (the source material)with perhaps a few nostalgic\nnods to the 1967 animated film. While I did see hints of Kipling's dark\nand intricate story line, they were glimpses-nods at best that were\nplaced at odds parts of the story and/or entirely upside down. The\nAkela death scene, scene with Mowgli carrying the torch, the cattle\nstamped scene, (all important story arks) etc are examples of attempts\nto remain close to the source material, but Disney choose to to distort\nthese major scenes to fit better with their new take on it for this\ngeneration. Doing so killed the potential in this movie as it was\nsoften and dulled and severally lacking entertainment other than\nvisuals &amp; the two beloved songs that made the cut.\n"},

Not a single moment of\n\"oh I'm glad I'm watching this movie\". It was more like \"I just hope\nthe next part will be good\" through out the whole movie. <br><br>First the acting from main character was so bad he had a same type of\nface expression every scene.

{"review": "\nYou must have heard it by now. The movie was shot entirely in a\nwarehouse in LA. And it boggles the mind every time I saw a wide\npanning shot of the jungle. Reminiscent of the kind of the Special\neffects that produced the sweeping vistas of Pandora in Avatar. But\nmuch like Avatar, Jungle book is lacking in almost every other\ndepartment. After hearing rave reviews about the lead actor, I had high\nhopes since the movie hinges on this one performance. He's OK. Bill\nMurray as Baloo was one of the bright spots. He has the funniest\nmoments and is truly every bit the bear from the original cartoon\nmovie. Idris Elba's turn as Shere Khan is a revelation. A very\nterrifying villain, his voice commands your attention. The story\nhowever, nothing much new. It hops from one nostalgic moment to the\nnext executed with some odd creative choices. Some of the dialogue was\nuninspired and pacing was a bit off. A live action version should have\nenabled them to explore some of the other characters in more depth but\nhere they have as many dimensions as they had in the cartoon movie or\nworse. At least the cartoon was more entertaining with it's dance\nnumbers and colorful characters. The way this one ended it was clearly\nleaving it open for a sequel. I would have preferred a solid ending\nwhich wrapped everything up neatly. This movie was clearly made for\nkids. The trailer gave me the impression we would get something more\ncomplex and mature. I was wrong. Warner Brothers also has it's live\naction Jungle Book movie coming out albeit 2 years away. Andy Serkis's\nJungle Book movie may deliver after all.\n"},

{"review": "\nDisney's remake of their take of the Rudyard Kipling books (which they\ndid for the first time in the 1960s) was a big hit at the box office.\nTo a degree I can see why - the locations are colorful and attractive\nto the eye, the special effects are first rate, and there are a few\ngood action sequences. Yet despite stuff like this to be found in the\nmovie, I thought the overall package was unsatisfying. To be truthful,\nit was hard for me to pin down what went wrong here, in part because\nthe movie isn't really awful. I think it's a bunch of little things.\nOne mistake the filmmakers made that's evident in the original movie is\nthat for the longest time in the middle of the movie, you don't really\nfeel much of a threat to the young protagonist - the movie almost\nforgets the threat. Another problem I found was the sometimes juvenile\ntone. While the original movie had that, it was a hand drawn animated\nmovie, so you could accept the goofiness. This live action remake,\nthough containing computer generated animation, looks \"real\", so it's\nhard to accept the goofiness at times. A third problem is that the\nmovie lazily takes chunks of the original movie (like the songs) and\ndoesn't do enough to put their own spin on the material. As I said, the\nmovie is not awful, and I admit that kids will almost certainly enjoy\nit a lot. But adults with pleasant memories of the original movie may\nfind the same problems that I did.\n"},
{"review": "\nMost movie remakes are never as good as the original, yet the Jungle\nBook, not only manages to include much of the animated movie with\namazing special effects and CGi, but also puts its own spin on the\nclassic. With the newly revised ending, an important lesson can be\nlearned between all of the action and thrills of the movie. Mowgli the\n\"man cub\" is a young boy who was raised in the wolf pack by Bagheera is\nliving peacefully in the jungle. However, after Shere Khan arrives and\nthreatens to kill him, he is forced to adventure through the jungle.\nAlong the way, he meets many new friends like Baloo the bear, but also\nencounters challenges like Kaa the hypnotic snake. In the end, Mowlgi\nrealizes that his place isn't with mankind but in the jungle with all\nof his friends. Although a fictional story about a boy trying to find\nout where he belongs in the forest, The Jungle Book teaches viewers\nthat family isn't always blood related.<br><br>Many of the animals are wary of a \"man cub\" in the forest and feel that\nMowgli does not belong in the jungle. Shere Khan, a human hating tiger\nwho was burned by fire, says, \"A man cub becomes a man, and man is\nforbidden.\" Exemplifying the feelings of mankind being banned in the\njungle. Due to this and the fact that Shere Khan has threatened to kill\nhis family the wolves, Mowgli feels that he should set out to find\nhuman civilization, which he thinks is where he truly belongs. Yet,\nwhen he gets to the village, with the help of a few of his friends, he\nrealizes that he doesn't belong in civilization as he is more suited in\nthe wilderness of the jungle. During his final showdown with Shere\nKhan, Mowgli says, \"But this is my home.\" Showing that he has realized\nthat the jungle is his home and the wolves are his family, even if he\nmay not be a wolf physically, he is a wolf in soul. Thus teaching the\naudience that family is not always blood and is why you should watch\nthis movie.\n"},

If you are a fan of the original Disney\nclassic from 1967 or a fan of Disney films in general, this film is\ndefinitely for you. The movie of course lacks the book's heart and\nsoul, but in general \"The Jungle Book\" is a visually impressive\nadventure, a new masterpiece of artful visual effects, that cannot be\nmissed on the big screen.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe only other movie version of The Jungle Book that I've seen was the\n1967 animated version that was the last one personally supervised by\nWalt Disney. This latest one from his studio follows many of the\nsequences from that version including the use of songs like \"The Bare\nNecessities\" and \"I Wanna Be Like You\". Well, actually the ending is a\nbit different which I won't reveal here. Anyway, this was a quite\nenjoyable version of Rudyard Kipling's tale of a man-cub raised in the\njungle being befriend by the various animals with the exception of a\ntiger named Shere Khan. I especially liked Bill Murray voicing Baloo\nthe Bear, previously done by Phil Harris in the animated version. So on\nthat note, that's a recommendation of this version of The Jungle Book.\n"},
{"review": "\nI didn't watch the original Disney animation as a kid much, nor did I\nread the book. I knew the story of course, the songs --- but it wasn't\nmy favorite ( say, compared to the Lion King ). Though the trailers\nlooked good, I still wasn't sure if I would actually enjoy it.<br><br>And, honestly? I did. I really enjoyed it, in fact. It was exciting,\nfunny, and comes with a lot of heart. I teared up more than once thanks\nto Lupita Nyong'o ( who voices Raksha, Mowgli's wolf mother ) --- she\ndid a really excellent job providing genuine, heartfelt emotion in her\nvoice, in particular. That said, I think the entire cast has a very\ndistinctive voice, and gave excellent performances. Idris Elba was\ncertainly another stand-out as Shere Khan, and Scarlett Johansson was a\nhypnotizing Kaa with her husky vocals. I could definitely go on all\nday, but I won't.<br><br>If you like the Jungle Book, you should probably see this movie. If you\nlike a good movie, you should probably see this movie. I won't say its\nperfect, or that everyone will like it ---- but it's worth giving it a\ngo if you like a good story being told.\n"},
{"review": "\nFavreau, should I say, was an underrated director. After knowing what\nhe did to iron man franchise, I feel unconvincing about The Jungle\nBook. When the movie hits it, well, it was magnificent. To me, It was\none kind of movie that perfectly using the maximum potential of CGI.\nThe panoramic, lightning, set-place, colors, they were all above\naverage. It's so different when Favreau doing the Iron Man franchise.\nIt was empty, blunt, and just a mediocre superhero movie. In Jungle\nBook, I see the things what Favreau can do, maximizing and intensify\nthe use of CGI. Yeah, that's it.<br><br>I wonder, those beautiful visualization in The Jungle Book could be\nimplemented more into upcoming Disney's. I just hope so.<br><br>It's been a long time, maybe i forgot when the last time i watch this\nkind of magnificent family-adventure film. The plot that Favreau used\nto TJB was interesting. Yeah, journey typical, supported with\npanoramic, pride, and friendship. Mogwli met so many other creature as\nthe duration goes on. These creature even have it's interesting things.\nBear, panther, wolfs, pigs, monkeys, orangutans, snake, tiger, and so\non. They all are a character, Favreau successfully put an exact\nduration to develop their character in the film. Most of the time, the\nway the story goes on seems unpredictable, it's a good things. That's\nwhat made TJB so strong in rating. The journey always give the audience\nsomething new, even if it was a creature, place, panorama, legend, etc.<br><br>Good job Favreau. You successfully made a new standard for CGI use. TJB\nis an incredible movie. I was amazed by Mowgli's journey. I recommend\neverybody from all age range to watch this. It's really worth to watch.\n"},
{"review": "\n. . . than actual Tigers left alive in the Wild, what better story for\nDisney to recycle than one about a Crusade to cremate one of the last\nfew Tigers left? It seems that when Tarzan was a boy, he went by the\nhandle of \"Mowgli.\" Sort of a one-kid wrecking crew in the jungle,\nMowgli specialized in vandalizing honeycombs, destroying Monkey\nTemples, and setting the jungle on fire--that is, when he wasn't tied\nup in hunting Tigers to extinction. Though the special effects of THE\nJUNGLE BOOK are pretty stunning, its message seems more appropriate to\nthe Last Ice Age, when a few thoughtless bozos wiped out the Wooly\nMammoths and dodo birds. While Disney Nature pays lip service to the\nConservation Cause every spring, these yawners make peanuts compared to\nsomething such as THE JUNGLE BOOK. But the Disney Megacorp. seems\nunwilling to put a sizable chunk of its money where its mouth appears\nto be.\n"},
{"review": "\nI went into this movie curious what way Jon Favreau was going to go\nwith this movie. Was he going to base it off of the 1967 animated movie\nwhere Mowgli was a boy in the jungle or the 1994 movie where Mowgli was\nan adult man that had a realistic feel to it.<br><br>He based it off of the animated movie. He gave human-like personalities\nto the characters, but they still kept the characters are very similar\nto the animated version. For example, King Louis was like a jazz artist\nin the animated version but is more of a mob boss in this one.<br><br>I really enjoyed Neel Sethi as Mowgli. His interactions with the\ndifferent personalities in the animals. He also did great being the\nsmart \"human\" but yet doesn't have a clue what he can do even though he\ndoes them.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis movie is absolutely fantastic. The special effects are\nunbelievable, the acting is wonderful, and it is just a lot of fun. The\nonly thing I can say is that kids below nine might not want to see it.\nThis movie is equally great for kids and adults. There is a nice nod to\nChristopher Walken's famous \"needs more cowbell\" sketch to look out\nfor. Over all, other than one awkward line and some speech from Kaa\nthat looked a little off, this movie is wonderful and my personal\nfavorite in a very long time. I cannot recommend this film enough, even\npeople who hated the 1967 animated version. This film is sometimes\nhappy, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, and sometimes it has a lot to\nsay. All I can say is that you should go and see it because I promise\nyou won't be disappointed.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Jungle Book's environments and most of its characters were created\nin computers. However, not one moment during this film did I think what\nI was seeing wasn't real. All the animals, especially the wolves, are\nincredibly detailed and have fluid movement. and the jungle environment\nreally does pop off the screen in the best way. <br><br>The story is also well done; there a few changes here and there from\nthe animated 1967 version and of course from the original book, but\nthey all serve this film well by making it quite a bit more intense.\nThis isn't just a movie for kids or adults; teenagers will definitely\nenjoy it too. There's plenty of animal action and epic set pieces.<br><br>The voice actors all do great, especially Bill Murray and Lupita\nNyong'o. Both have some surprisingly emotional moments that have not\nbeen given away in the trailer. Of course, the movie is carried by\nMowgli and the little boy who plays him turns in an excellent child\nperformance, one of the best in a while. (Which is especially\nimpressive given that he acted to a green screen most of the time.)\nOverall, The Jungle Book is a great family movie with very high\nproduction value. See it no matter your age.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am a huge fan of Disney's animated movies, I own most of the classics\non Blu-Ray that I find joy in watching over and over again.

The\nvisuals were spectacular, the CGI was done extremely well.<br><br>I think both parents and children would have a good time watching this\nmovie, I would give this a 7 out of 10.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw \"The Jungle Book\", starring Neel Sethi-in his first movie and the\nvoices of Bill Murray-Aloha, Lost in Translation; Idris Elba-Luther_tv,\nNo Good Deed; Scarlett Johansson-Lucy, Lost in Translation; Ben\nKingsley-The Walk, Iron Man 3 and Christopher Walken-Jersey Boys, Joe\nDirt.<br><br>This is a live-action adaptation of the 1967 Disney animated movie, The\nJungle Book. Jon Favreau is the director. You might know some of his\nprevious movies that he directed; Cowboys &amp; Aliens, Iron Man 1 &amp; 2,\nElf. Neel plays Mowgli with Bill voicing Baloo, Idris voicing Shere\nKhan, Scarlett voicing Kaa, Ben voicing Bagheera and Christopher\nvoicing King Louie. Neel is raised by wolves in the jungle. All the\nanimals talk in English. All the animals like Neel except Idris, the\ntiger, who wants to kill him. Ben decides it would be best if he took\nNeel to be with other humans and leads him into the jungle on a journey\nto reunite with his kinfolk. Along the way, they run into Bill,\nScarlett and Christopher. There are lots to keep both adults and\nchildren entertained-I particularly liked the scene when Neel is about\nto meet Christopher and comes across a cowbell. There are a few songs\nthat you might recognize; I remember hearing The Bear Necessities, I\nWanna Be Like You and Trust In Me. This movie is good family\nentertainment. It's rated \"PG\" for some scary action and peril and has\na running time of 1 hour &amp; 45 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would\nbuy it on DVD.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Jungle Book is directed by Jon Favreau and is another version of\nthe classic story. And this is a fantastic film with so much to love.\nThe entire film is CGI and I honestly don't understand how because the\nfilm looks so real. The animals, the jungle, everything looks so real.\nThe voice work is also phenomenal. My favorites were Bill Murray as\nBaloo and Idris Elba as Shere Khan. Baloo is the comic relief while\nShere Khan is the fierce and extremely menacing villain. Neel Sethi is\nin his first movie here as Mowgli and he's terrific. He is able to show\ngreat emotion throughout when he's not even looking at real people or\nthings, which is remarkable.<br><br>Other voices include Ben Kingsley, Lupita Nyong'o, and Christopher\nWalken, and everyone is really good. The story is pretty straight\nforward and it moves at a pretty quick rate. There are barely any dull\nmoments in the film, but when there are, they're really emotionally\ncaptivating. This brings me to my ONE problem with the movie. The scene\nwith Mowgli and Kaa, the snake, kind of comes out of nowhere and\ncompletely slows the movie's momentum that was being built before. It\nwas cool to watch but it felt a little misplaced in the movie. Other\nthan that, this is an excellent film. The best aspect about The Jungle\nBook is its characters since they're so likable and the villain Shere\nKhan is very well realized and his motivations are clear.<br><br>Overall, The Jungle Book is an excellent adaption of the source\nmaterial. It's witty, funny, entertaining, and emotional to make for an\nenjoyable film for audiences of all ages. The Jungle Book gets an A.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's a great movie in terms of 3D, sound effects, and pace of the\nstory, though I didn't see the original version of the movie.<br><br>The 3D is breathtaking because each animal acts naturally. For example,\nI really like the scene that the boy and the bear are swimming and\nsinging in the river together because it lets me feel I am in the\njungle as well. For the sound effect, it helps to create the mysterious\natmosphere of the jungles. I like the casting of the snake most. The\npace of the story flows, though the story is a bit simple for me. I\nmean it would be better for kids who believe there are only the good\nand the bad in the world.<br><br>Overall, it's still a great movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe 1967 Jungle Book is a timeless classic and that can never be\nchanged or scribbled over, but they have challenged that title with\nthis film. In the build up to the film, there have been lots of doubts\nabout this movie, the doubts were wrong. It was fantastic and a serious\nspin on the family film. The way it is done with the effects works\nbrilliantly with the young Neel Seethi, who delivers a role that\ncaptures the brilliance and love in the first Mowgli. The Bare\nNecessities was used fantastically and Bill Murray is amazing, but is\nthe second song well used? It is in a serious moment in the movie and\nKing Louie has a great presence, but he suddenly breaks out into song,\nstrange! Idris Elba, Scarlett Johanson, Ben Kingsley, Neel Sethi and\nBill Murray are just some of the names that make this movie, their\nacting is phenomenal and they are at their best.

{"review": "\nThe Jungle Book is a breathtakingly fresh new imagining of a classic\nstory that most everyone holds dear.

My only complaints are few, Neel Sethi can't act to\nsave his life, not every song fit quite as well as I would've hoped.\nBut the movie is astoundingly beautiful in every way, the CGI creatures\nare so lifelike it's almost mesmerizing, and to that extent, the voice\nacting flows well with that all, not being as weird as one might think.\nThis is another great family movie, and one this year desperately\nneeded. I highly recommend everyone check this out, I certainly enjoyed\nmyself and I'm certain you will too.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Jungle Book was a classic. Usually when a review starts off this\nway, it means that the the remake did not live up to the original. This\nmovie did. Rudyard Kipling's classic story, once retold by one of the\nworld's most inspiring men, has now been retold once again in this epic\nCGI sculpted world. From the music, composed by John Debney, to the\nstory, retold by Justin Marks, this film was a born-again classic. Who\nsays you can't mess with the original? While the acting fell a bit\nflat, the story and the visual effects did not. This movie had,\nundoubtedly, the BEST visual effects I think I have ever seen in a film\nthus far. Never have I seen a film with such an impeccable and lively\nplot either. I truly loved that Kaa, played by Scarlett Johansson, was\nable to deliver Mowgli's back story. I also loved that the writer\nincorporated the music that we so dearly loved from the original Disney\nclassic into this new-age classic. I must also mention the outstanding\nattention to detail when alluding to the original film. At some points,\nI may or may not have teared up thinking about the man that put this\nstory on screen for the first time. I guess that's what great\nstoryteller's do. They inspire and pay tribute to those that have\ninspired them as well. Thank you so much to everyone behind this film.\nYou have truly made me a happy man and a proud fan of Walt Disney\nStudios.\n"},

In My Opinion this is a good movie. I love the\nanimation, the animal and all the environment. the Audio itself made me\nfeel like I'm in a forest. It's perfect. The acting of Neel (mowgli)\nwas very good, He is smart, active and \"childis\". the story was good\ntoo, It don't bring many surprises, but it would be very good for your\nfamily movie. the animal's character, the moral, the cute etc. They\nwill entertaint you.

{"review": "\nThis Rudyard Kipling classic was a big task for Jon Favreau with the\nworld watching to see if he would do the story justice. Starting with\nthe aspect of vocal performance, this movie packed an all star cast of\nwhich would make any movie buff overly excited. Bill Murray as a\nfriendly bear, Ben Kingsley as a wise panther, Idris Elba as an\ncunning, evil and strong tiger, Scarlett Johansson as a seductive\nsnake, and Christopher Walken as a greedy singing orangutan. In regards\nto voice acting this movie deserves applause. although the main (and\npretty well only actual actor) Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, has a week\narray of acting skills but I wouldn't expect much more from a child his\nage. My first thoughts after watching this movie had to do with the\nobvious message about the relationship between humanity and nature.\nHumans are viewed as a destructive force that brings destruction\nwherever they are. This is the fundamental reason Elbas Tiger wants\nMowgli dead. The music and songs really emphasised the feel of each\nscene. Although some would argue that the lack of sound and music\ncreated a empty unfulfilling space. I feel as though the 'lack'\nactually created a more exciting feel. This movie fulfilled every\naspect of cinema extraordinaire that i would expect from an adventure\nfilm. Favreau has fulfilled this amazing display of a great work and\nhas succeeded in taken audiences on a adventure journey filled with\ncomedy, action and suspense.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was eagerly waiting from the day I saw the trailer. It was exiting,\nlike revisiting my childhood. The movie starts in a simple fashion, 3d\neffects kick in. The sets are and the effects blend in. Neel Sethi as\nMowgli as done a great job and having Ben Kingsley as Bagheera was the\nbest choice. Story stays simple, but interesting characters are bought\nin at perfect interval. Voices of Scarlett Johansson as Kaa, and Bill\nMurray as Baloo do grab attention. <br><br>The thing that left me wanting for more was the run time, they could\neasily have added another 15-20 min. The important character in Jungle\nbook is Shere Khan and Idris Elba's voice strikes fear. The Shere Khan\ncharacter is one which fearsome and really takes center stage as a\nmedium of danger and wildness of the jungle. Why I don't understand for\nsome reason the character in the movie is more dark, fearful but kind\nof ugly too. Shere is show too weak, old and made me a bit resistivity\nthat what I had experienced in book. The songs are situational and\ngood, but are not that fine- tuned as any other Disney movies.<br><br>Being down all of these, it's still a good movie for kids and adults\nalike. Stunning visuals, some great chases and neatly done effects\nleaves us much to cheer for. The adaption is justified and Rudyard\nKipling's writing are neatly pictured on screen. So drop into theater's\nto enjoy the adventures of Mowgli and the difficulties he and animals\nfaces on being in jungle.\n"},
{"review": "\nMowgli is back in the jungle! I loved this movie!<br><br>The Jungle Book is a mind blowing film. It is the most gorgeous movie,\nI have ever seen. What's extremely fascinating is that, the whole\nenvironment in the film is CGI. The animals are also CGI &amp; yet, they\nlook extremely lifelike. The forest the movie is set in, looks\nbreathtaking. Director Jon Favreau &amp; the rest of the crew, have\nmaintained the soul of the 1967 animated movie of the same name. Kudos\nto the visual effects team, for making a live-action adaptation of a\nmovie like The Jungle Book. Don't worry. This film is not a carbon copy\nof the Disney animated original. Favreau adds many new elements to the\nfilm, that will keep you guessing right till the end. The set pieces of\nthe movie, are its highlight.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am not saying that this is bad movie. It has some good elements to\nkeep you engaged. But it certainly lacks the innocence which we\nexperienced in cartoon animated version. I do have entire episodes DVD\nand I still watch it with pleasure. <br><br>When I saw the trailer of this movie, I instantly liked it, may be out\nof sheer nostalgia and sweet childhood memories which we always look\nback with rose tinted glasses. So I went to theater with huge\nexpectations. What I saw was just, a splendid and spectacular graphical\nrepresentation of forest, animals and fight sequences. Overall ambiance\nand sound effect was cherry on top. Undoubtedly one of the finest CGI I\nhave ever saw. With 3d glasses it made me feel like I am living life of\nMowgli in Jungle. <br><br>Alas.... It does lack content. Innocence of Mowgli and his friendship\nwith other animals was missing except relation of Bhaloo and Mowgli.\nThat was beautifully shot and that is what I was expecting throughout\nmovie. Instead it was heavy graphical bombardment. I didn't understand\nthe need of surprise sound effects during fight sequence or middle of\nthe dialogue like suspense or horror movies. By being an adult I was\nterrified in 3-4 scenes, No wonder Indian Censor Board gave it U/A\ncertificate considering scenes might be violent for under age kids. <br><br>As far as Hindi dubbing is considered, Voices were chosen wisely I\nguess. Full marks to Hindi dubbing. Nana Patekar for Sherkhan - Super\nIrrfan Khan for Bhaloo - Super Om Puri for Baghira - Super <br><br>Only 1 actor is in movie to judge. And we can say that Neel Sethi\nnailed it as Mowgli with his body language and expressions. <br><br>If you are going with the expectation to experience Jungle book which\nwe saw in animated cartoon version then you may face disappointment but\nif you want to experience 3D, CGI and good sound effect then go for it.\n"}
