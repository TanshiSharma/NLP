{"review": "\nThis movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that\nholds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for\nhumanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is\nabout investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the\ncatholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that.\nHonestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face\nof the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up\nthings happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to\nthe innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they\nare robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in\nthe film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of\nme a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was\nboth shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably.\n\"Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you,\nit could've been me, it could've been any of us.\" Indeed. When we\nwitness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it,\nthat's when we fail. A poet once wrote, \"You can join the millions\ntalking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the\nnight.\" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate\nthe oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication\nof the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the\ncinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!\n"},
{"review": "\nEverything about this movie is outstanding -- the performances, the way\nthe true events are handled, the cinematography. In this day of digital\nnews, this movie makes us stand back and realize what we may lose in\nthe way of investigative journalism as we slowly kill off print media.<br><br>The lengths the directors go to to achieve a sense of authenticity is\nremarkable. We are there in Boston in 2001-2002. We get to know enough\nabout each character to make him or her real, but not enough to create\nside dramas. The focus remains the child abuse scandal in the\narchdiocese in Boston. That reflects the conflict the characters face\nand deal with when events make them rethink the focus of their article.<br><br>The movie is riveting, though we know the outcome.\n"},

But I am\nafraid I can't say anything more than that, it is very documentary like\nwhich can be it's biggest strength (a very fact driven plot heavy film)\nor it's biggest weakness (characters feel cold and distant and other\nthan the plot nothing really impresses, also quite bland in the visuals\ndepartment). However the characters do start to show some life nearing\nthe end of the film but by that time damage is done it can be hard if\nnot impossible for viewers to differentiate between the reporters for\nnearly one and a half hour of the film, they all suffer from different\nfaces but same objective syndrome and inadequate effort is made to\nseparate one from the another. Also speaking of run-time, this film is\na wee bit over two hours long, editing especially in the first half\ncould have made this film a bit crispier. However I did like the\naccuracy level in the film regarding the cellphones, ads, electronics\nand the cars used in 2001; a lot of films these days are becoming very\ncareless in this regard. I would compare it to last year's Foxcatcher\nanother fact driven docu-drama film, solidly acted, but nothing special\nin the direction, editing and cinematography department, I would still\nrecommend it but no way this film deserves a second watch, you can\nabsorb everything there is to get in a single viewing.

{"review": "\nFirst off, this is an important film. The fact there's such a rampant\nsystemic issue with an organization as large as the Catholic Church is\nappalling.

This movie is brilliant all across the\nboard: the performances, the cinematography, the story, the dialogue,\nthe direction, and just about everything in-between. If you're\nCatholic, please understand this movie is NOT an attack on Catholocism,\nbut mainly a film exploiting a systemic issue in the Catholic Church.\nIf anything, Catholics should be more outraged than the rest of us, but\nI digress.

From the geographic\naccuracy of Boston and other areas around it, to the details of the\nstory, to the portrayals of the characters, Spotlight is a\nnigh-flawless product that not only excels on a technical level, but is\ngoing to have relevance for many generations to come.\n"},

A\nstory, about child molestation, which nobody can be indifferent to.\nMost of the molested back then kids - 30 years later with kids of their\nown, had been through many obstacles due to the ghastly immoral act.\nSome of them had taken the path of the syringe and drugs.

{"review": "\nDid SPOTLIGHT deserve to win Best Picture at this year's Academy\nAwards? Maybe, I guess. I still haven't seen all of the nominees yet,\nbut even still I recognize that SPOTLIGHT is an excellent film. Based\non true events, it tells how the Boston Globe broke the story about a\nmassive cover-up of pedophile priests in the Catholic Church. It also\nfeatures an incredible ensemble cast who, although not given much to do\nindividually, work great together in service of a very compelling (and\nsaddening) story. Out of the five actors given top billing, I would say\nthat Liev Schreiber and Mark Ruffalo fare the best, although the rest\nof the cast don't slouch by any means. Rachel McAdams is perhaps the\nweakest out of the bunch, but even she mostly holds her own. Far and\naway, the most important takeaways are the devotion to pursuing the\ntruth no matter where it leads you, as well as the integrity necessary\nin investigative journalism. Some people have called this the greatest\njournalism movie since ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but I still need to see\nthat in order to make such a comparison. Briefly touching on other\nmatters, I thought the score and cinematography were quite adequate\nenough to elevate this beyond something that would normally play as a\nmade-for-HBO movie. In particular, I liked the use of substantial\ntracking shots, which visually reinforced the winding and\ninterconnected paths that the Globe's spotlight team go on in pursuit\nof their story. Ultimately, there is a lot in here that could shake\none's faith in humanity and human institutions, particularly religion,\nhowever I never felt like they demonized anyone. It merely acknowledged\nthe imperfections and, some of the time, willful negligence of said\ninstitutions and the communities they serve, while also aspiring to\nbetter accountability in both.

The events of \"Spotlight\" at the\neditorial staff of The Boston Globe happened 2001, when the internet\nwas new to the big crowd and journalists had time for deep research\nwork because of a lot of print readers (and enough money available for\ngood work. Because when things run massively wrong in society, like in\nthis terrible case at the Catholic Church, it needs dedicated people,\nwho look deeply behind the smokescreen. The movie shows, how difficult\nit is, to mess with established institutions like the church, because\npeople don't want to know, that with this savior they believe in,\nsomething totally going wrong. The members of the Spotlight team are\ntrue heroes, working in the background. The movie put a spotlight on\ntheir outstanding work.\n"},
{"review": "\nYou spotlight up my life, you give me hope, to carry on... Sorry to get\nall Debbie Booneish on you in my intro on my review of the spectacular\nmovie \"Spotlight\". Director Tom McCarthy's movie about the true story\nof how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child\nmolestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese is\nshaking up to the be the frontrunner of the Best Picture Oscar, and why\nnot? McCarthy's meticulous direction of the film and his layering of\nits expose was a sermonial, I mean a ceremonial piece of mastery. The\nBoston Globe's investigative \"Spotlight\" department shined on unveiling\nthis disturbing truth. What was not disturbing was the exemplary acting\nperformances from the actors playing the \"spotlight\" write players;\nincluding Mark Ruffalo as the emotional Mike Rezendes, Rachel McAdams\nas the conflicted Sacha Pfeiffer, Brian D'arcy James as the cerebral\nMatt Carroll, and the \"Birdman\" himself Michael Keaton as the group's\nleader Robby Robinson. Keaton and Ruffalo were the standouts here, but\nall should be given the proper spotlight for their commendable acting.\nOther fine thespian turns came from Stanley Tucci as the counsel\nMitchell Garadebian, Liev Schrieber as the paper's new editor Marty\nBaron, and John Slattery as the associate editor Ben Bradlee. It will\nbe very sad if this acting group does not get the SAG Best Acting\nEnsemble Award. McCarthy's script with fellow screenplayer Josh Singer\nhad all of the write stuff of a multi- dimensional narrative covering\nan uncomfortable subject matter. Sure, the film does depict journalists\nas literary superheroes, but their procedural process workings was\ntheir greatest weapon to get rid of the darkness of the subject they\nwere investigating; and it isn't that what superheroes do? or something\nlike that? Anyways, I pray that \"Spotlight' receives many Oscar\nnominations, as it should. So, it's now time for you to see and then\nshare the \"Spotlight\". ***** Excellent\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Spotlight\" is one of the best realistic and serious movies of recent\nyears. I don't want to tell the story, as you will watch it soon or\nlater, but I want to admire the movie and the content itself. Instead\nof falling into the stereotypical hero and anti-hero type of movies,\nthe movie narrates the story with realistic characters, sensual\nREALISTIC emotions and incredibly depicts the integrity and handwork of\nthe Boston Globe investigation team. The acting of Mark Ruffalo and\nMichael Keaton are great. Finally, the movie does not fall into the\ncategory of twisty blockbusters but a realistic movie about an\nimportant subject that anyone will admire.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's not often I follow the Oscars or go out of my way to see\nOscar-winning films, because they're usually not to my taste. However,\nI can make an exception for SPOTLIGHT, a film which looked fantastic\nfrom the trailer and what I had read about it. Having just caught up\nwith it and watched it twice in a row, I can report that this is an\nexcellent piece of film-making: dark, harrowing, and grimly realistic,\nbut also thoroughly entertaining with it.<br><br>It tells the true story of the Boston Globe newspaper's exposure of\nchild abusing priests from the Catholic Church. The viewer follows the\nstory from the rumours at the outset to the very real and grounded\ninformation that comes through and the final publishing of the story.\nThere are lots of quieter moments and some eye-popping twists and\nturns, usually when the scale of the abuse is exposed. I know the\nsubject of paedophilia in film is very distasteful, but this film is\nmore about the crusading journalist team than the subject matter\nitself. In that way it harks back to classics like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S\nMEN, although Fincher's ZODIAC is also a reference point.<br><br>The calibre of this film is excellent and everything about it is very\nstrong from the cinematography to the direction. Despite the lengthy\nrunning time, this is a fast-paced feature in which no scene lasts more\nthan a couple of minutes. It takes you on a roller-coaster ride of\nfact-checking, breakthroughs, and battles against both a conspiracy of\nsilence and the American legal system. The acting is excellent across\nthe board, which is a surprise in some cases (Rachel McAdams) and\nexpected in others (Ruffalo equals and surpasses his performance in\nZODIAC). Michael Keaton also delivers one of his best performances and\nputs the old memories of a rubbery Batman far behind him. SPOTLIGHT is\na real gem.\n"},
{"review": "\nWith so many movies about investigative journalism elevating their\nprotagonists to near-godlike status, to the detriment of the film's\ncredibility, \"Spotlight\" is a welcome relief. Focusing on the Boston\nGlobe's investigation into pedophile priests' abuses and the shameful\neffort on the part of the Catholic Church's leadership - and a fair\namount of the congregation - to avoid the problem rather than fix it,\ncontributing to the life-shattering abuse of countless children.<br><br>The reporters and their bosses are portrayed as skilled, determined,\nand dogged, but still human, struggling with their own backgrounds and\nconcerns about their sources. More surprisingly, the managing editors\nand senior reporters are NOT portrayed as spineless, risk-averse\nroadblocks so common in journalism movies. Instead, the clear villain\nis the leadership of the Catholic Church and the lawyers for clients\nthat profited from settling cases ad nauseum for decades, contributing\nto the abuse.<br><br>As someone raised Catholic, this scandal didn't shake my faith in\nCatholicism but it certainly shook my faith in the institution. This\nmovie is unsentimental, avoiding subplots that would have been needless\ndistraction. In essence, this is a template for movies about\ninvestigative journalism.<br><br>Also, this is the movie that \"Kill the Messenger\" wanted to be but\ninstead fell into the normal, drama-enhancing traps (stereotyping the\nreporter's editors, stretching the facts, making the reporter a martyr,\netc).\n"},

Conflict of interest? Balanced\njournalism? Where are the stories on pederast rabbis? Pedophile school\nteachers? etc.? In this sense, the film correctly portrayed Barton as\nbeing against \"the system\" (i.e., against the Catholic Church).<br><br>Also, Boston Globe won the Pulitzer Prize in 2003 because of its\nSpotlight team's work. The Spotlight film won an Academy Award for best\nfilm of 2015! Pattern here?

{"review": "\nThe movie is a great disclosure of what is happening for a long time\ninside of Catholic Church.

{"review": "\n\"Spotlight\" is based on a real-life story surrounding the scandalous\nreveals of decade-long hushed-up affairs of sexual abuse in the Boston\nbishopric conducted by the reporters of the Boston Globe. The\nhot-potato-topic is an important addition to the already global\ncritical discourse regarding pedophilia in the Catholic Church and a\ncondemnation of its practice of merely removing child molesting priests\nto other parishes. The portraits of victims, already formed adults with\nfamilies or single, gay or straight, but with the common characteristic\nof suffering badly under the suppressed trauma of the abuse, are both\ntouching and revealing. It shows how deep you need to dig to find the\nsource of suffering in a person, and how a fear of stigmatization can\nturn a person into a psychological mess, whereas the real culprits\nremain unpunished. In many communities, the Church plays a central role\nin terms of social life or can even be the only way out of peril for\ndestitute people and children from troubled backgrounds. Which makes\nexposing the very people who help you as monsters in disguise even\nharder, bordering on unbearable. Coming from a country heavily\ninfluenced by religious institutions, I know how it feels to try to\nspeak up against them and to feel the herds of their brainwashed flock\ncoming at you.<br><br>Mark Ruffalo and Liev Shreiber did a great job here, and quite\nunexpectedly, the movie earned a best pic Oscar. An upside of the film\ncould be that, similarly like in Burnt, we see a very accurate\ndescription of work dynamics in a newspaper HQ, with the difference of\nthe former happening in a restaurant kitchen. If there's anything one\ncould point at as a flaw, it's the fact that the film borders on\ndocumentary in terms of style and you can't help thinking it could be\nreduced to a 45-minute long doc on sexual abuse scandals in the\nCatholic church, with no losses in terms of its effect on the viewer.\n"},

Whilst Spotlight addresses horrific crimes against\nchildren, I did not consider it to be in any way gratuitous or\nexploitative. It has a docu-drama feel about it which makes it somewhat\ncold and impersonal.<br><br>It must be noted that Spotlight is a true story about the investigative\nprocess led by three committed journalists, their editor (brilliantly\nplayed by Michael Keaton), the socially awkward editor in chief also\nwonderfully downplayed by the always dependable Liev Schrieber, and\ntheir relationship with members of the legal fraternity. <br><br>It is however less concerned about the abuse victims' stories and is\nlargely focused on the team's interest in exposing the magnitude of the\nsystemic abuse by the Catholic Church. Which as we are now all\nwitnessing from watching the news, reverberates all the way to the\nVatican. Make no mistake, in certain scenes, this film will make your\nblood boil. And this is to me Spotlight's fundamental weakness in that\nit really only manages to scratch the surface of the horrors for which\nthe church is squarely responsible.

There are lots of regrets and many\nspeculations that this team is working to bring light to. Michael\nKeaton heads the operation hoping to convince old colleagues to reverse\ntheir previous decision and right previous wrongs. Mark Ruffalo has fun\nwith a rookie role where he saunters about trying to get an attorney,\nplayed by Stanley Tucci to allow him to interview past victims. Tucci\nwould prefer that the emotional wounds of these victims not be opened\nbut he soon comes to terms with the importance of not having these\nincidents happen in the future. Rachel McAdams plays another journalist\nwho is determined to break this story but often meets with rejection.\nAt one point she even has a former priest admitting his wrong until his\nsister warns her away. Liev Schreiber plays a new arrival who first\nopens this story up. Director Tom McCarthy handles the film in similar\nvein as All the President's Men or The Paper with realism in the sets\nand locations with a touch of paranoia thrown in. The subject is\nsensitive and controversial but perhaps the film deals this subject\nbecause it is handled very discreetly in reality. Now it is given the\nspotlight it needs to bring the guilty to justice and the victims\ncloser to closure. Score: 10 / 10\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a great movie and hard movie to watch. It follows the Boston\nGlobes investigation into the Catholic church molestation allegations.\nWhat they uncover is widespread across not just Boston but all of\nAmerica. The journalism side of the film is really well done. You\nreally get to understand how they build such a big story and uncover it\nin great detail. All the actors who play the journalists working for\nthe globe are great. Michael Keaton leads the team and he does a great\njob of getting to the truth of the story. You can really feel he's a\nreal person in the story and not just acting. Rachel McAdams is also\nvery effective as an investigative journalist who goes and interviews a\nlot of the victims getting to hear their stories. Mark Ruffalo is also\ngreat as a man who is desperate for the truth and his character does\nlet his emotions get the better of him at a certain moment. But you\ncan't blame him this is a serious issue that has plagued the Catholic\nchurch for decades. Its not a subject matter that's easy to take.

{"review": "\nI'm not the first person to say this, but Spotlight probably is the\nbest journalism movie since All the President's Men.

So he assigns the Globe's \"spotlight\" team to the\nstory \u0096 a close-knit group of journalists who uncover the biggest\nscandals in Boston. Michael Keaton leads the team consisting of Mark\nRuffalo, Rachel McAdams, and a few others as they delve into one of the\nmost important journalism investigations of our time. <br><br>The execution of Spotlight is what really made it the best picture\nwinner at the Oscars. The way it delves into the journalistic process \u0096\nthe countless interviews, the research, piecing things together with\nscant evidence until you get the smoking gun \u0096 that's what keeps you\nwatching this movie. A journalism investigation is not exactly\nsomething you think would hold your attention for two hours, but it\ndoes. It is also a very tightly edited film \u0096 each scene moves the\nstory forward and not a moment is wasted or excessive. <br><br>What I especially admire about Spotlight is its low key feel and humble\nnature. It celebrates the value of investigative reporting while\nacknowledging that journalists really dropped the ball by not pursuing\nthis story sooner. It gives this serious issue the importance it\ndeserves while asking the question \u0096 why did it take people,\nparticularly journalists, so long to act? All of the pieces were there\nfor them to put together. Could they have done something sooner? And it\ndoes all this with very few manipulative, Oscar baity moments.

How finding out the truth and exposing it was crucial to\nbringing hard to grasp facts to the focus of the entire world. I see\nOscar winners written all over this picture. Best Picture right on to\nBest Male Actor \u0096 and two of them should be nominated here, Mark\nRuffalo and Michael Keaton. Terrific performances by both. This movie\nmoves right along, bringing it all together in a way that almost numbs\nyour mind by the time it's done. When the end credits roll and it shows\nhow this single story brought out atrocious child molestation scandals,\nnot only in America, but all over the world, and you see the long, long\nlist of places, you can hardly manage to get up from your seat and walk\nout into the world. You are stunned. This is not a spoiler, but I have\nto say, at one point in this film, without a word spoken, you watch the\ncamera scroll down pages of names and facts, and in the background you\nhear a chorus of innocent young voices singing a Christmas carol, the\nhair on the back of your neck rises\u0085.you KNOW you are watching\nsomething brilliant.

{"review": "\nAmazingly this is an excellent movie. It is amazing because in this day\nand age when Hollywood has opted to play up sensationalist glitz at the\nexpense of substance, this movie does just the opposite. It tells a\nstory. It does so in a straightforward manner, with no gratuitous\nscenes of violence or seedy sex. The story depicts a team of reporters\nwho do a job, and do it right. They have some leads, develop their\nsources, collect the evidence, put it all together and publish a story.\nWhat they did took a lot of courage. Michael Keaton gives a strong\nperformance as the leader of the team of reporters. However, it is Mark\nRuffalo who emerges as the star of this movie. His performance\ndominates the movie. The subject of the story is controversial and\nsensitive. It deals with a religious institution that allows itself to\nbecome a cover for sexual perverts and then tries to cover up the mess,\nin the process deceiving the public. Sadly, but not surprisingly, this\nmovie is based on a true story. That's why this movie must be watched.\n"},

{"review": "\nAmazing cast (but none of them doing career best work), weighty theme\nhandled well (and yet the Church is completely demonized, with no\nreasonable opposing view of their actions in dealing with the scandal)\nthe direction is fairly tight - however the dialogue is occasionally\nvery on the nose and scenes often skim the surface and then cut away to\nthe next thing without really building or exploring in depth. The music\nand pacing was fine but at times felt like a really high end TV movie\nrather than a theatrical film. It is an affecting drama, well-told, I\njust felt it never reached the fever pitch of outrage it really should\nhave, and the ending is quite underwhelming. There is a lot of\ntalking/exposition/monologuing. Would have been nice for some\nrevelations to happen visually/through action the audience could\nobserve first hand. It feels kind of labored as is. I personally don't\nthink anything about the film is awards worthy, except maybe Ruffalo\n(what else is new?) and while Todd McCarthy is a fine filmmaker, this\nis not his best film and nowhere near the directorial achievement of\nsomeone like Lenny Abrahamson for Room. I just feel like the reason\ncritics are really raving about this film is that it shows their fellow\njournalists getting to be the heroes.\n"},
{"review": "\nMmm, might make my top 50 of 2015. It's a perfectly good movie about\ninvestigative journalism, and it's interesting to see the process of\njournalists, but it's extremely pedestrian filmmaking and has like zero\ninsight into the subject at hand (which is the cover-up of priest\nmolestations). Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Brian\nd'Arcy James play the Spotlight team at the Boston Globe. They're all\ngood, but, except for one big moment with Ruffalo, none of them do\nanything exceptional. The Globe's new editor, Liev Schreiber (somewhat\nmore interesting, but not much), decides to follow-up on some earlier\nstories about the subject he thinks are incomplete. The best\nperformance in the film belongs to Stanley Tucci, who plays a lawyer\nfor victims. The second best belongs to Neal Huff as the leader of a\nvictims' organization. Both Huff and Tucci are angry that the Globe is\njust now getting interested in the story. I think even critics in\nBoston know that Mad Max: Fury Road is a better film than this. Maybe\nsome day the Spotlight team can uncover that conspiracy.\n"},

It is distant, you cannot feel the tense, the importance of the\ncase ... <br><br>And acting could be a bit better as well.

One of the\nelements that was really intriguing is how long it actually takes for\nthis team to compile this particular story. It took them mouths to\nfinish the story, but it does not feel like mouths, cause they make the\nstory they try to compile interesting to watch. Plus we get to know the\ncharacters on a personal level without getting too personal. Nothing\ntakes us away from the main focus of the movie.<br><br>Mark Ruffalo gives an impressive performance as Michael Rezendes. He\nwas very intense and passionate and it comes off great, and was a great\nrole for him. He stood out in a very interesting ensemble cast that\nincluded Michael Keaton, as the editor of spotlight supporting his\nreporters as they chase the story and Liev Schreiber, as the new editor\nand chief of the Globe, an outsider who saw a story that the others too\nclose to home, did not. They're other great performances from Rachel\nMcAdams and Stanley Tucci as well. <br><br>Spotlight also makes Boston itself a charter, by using scenery to show\nwhat a small town it can be and how much of an influence the Catholic\nChurch has on it. <br><br>It hits all the right buttons without trying, that's a sign of good\nstory telling.

{"review": "\nI finally saw this film a few hours before tonight's Academy Awards\nbroadcast. I had a feeling that it had the chops to win the big one.\nMany of my friends have been touting it. It takes a truly skilled\ndirector and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something\nwhere they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold\nof the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director\ncomes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest\nmisconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who\nare unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is\nthere. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of\nsensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and\nuses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as\nanything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have\nweaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This\nplays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense. Loved this.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis was a solid drama elevated by superior acting from a top-notch\ncast but I left the theater somewhat underwhelmed. The movie lacked the\nsort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when\nyou know how the story will end.
