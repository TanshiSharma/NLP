{"review": "\nDon't Breathe. Excellent title for movie directed by Fede Alvarez.\nAfter watching preview, this movie was on my must see list. Extremely\nwell directed. The blind man, played superbly by Stephen Lang, lives\nalone with his ferocious looking, big , black dog in a shabby\nneighborhood house in Michigan. 3 young people, Jane Levy as Rocky, her\nboyfriend Daniel Zovatto as Money and Dylan Minnette as Alex want to\nget rich the quick way - by robbing. The blind man , a war veteran,\ncame into lot of money after his daughter's death in a car accident.\nThe 3 potential robbers go to the blind man's house for the money and\nthen come to know about his blindness. Expecting no fight, the three\nenter his house and from then on, starts the horrible night events. The\nblind man knows how to live his lonely life despite daughter's accident\nand knows how to have a happy future. The blind man believes in life\nfor life. Terrific movie. Extremely well directed. Terrific acting by\nStephen Lang and Jane Levy. I am not a dog lover and the dog in the\nmovie did a good , ferocious, vicious animal role part very well.\nexcellent cinematography. Good Editing. Overall , a very good scary\nmovie. Do not underestimate a war vet. I enjoyed every scene in the\nmovie. Highly recommended.\n"},
{"review": "\nI would certainly classify this as more of a thriller than a horror\nfilm. Horror films can get away with stretching the imagination more\nthan most films and since this was more of a thriller, in my opinion,\nthere were too many such \"stretches\". Some plot elements were\nadequately covered early in the film. For instance, Rocky wants the\nmoney so she can escape to the west coast...check. The antagonist can\ndrag a person down the middle of the street because it was established\nvia GoPro camera that there is no traffic in that neighborhood...check.\nHe keeps the girl in the cellar to give birth to a new\ndaughter...check. But the bad points outweigh the good...1 - Why is it\nassumed that the guy has a huge amount of cash in his house just\nbecause he got a settlement for his daughter's death? Oh, he's weird so\nhe doesn't have a bank account? The cash in his home should have been\nbased on a better premise. 2 - The guy is in the same room with two of\nthe kids that break into his home and even passes by them in the hall,\nbut can't smell them. However, he walks into the kitchen and discovers\nthey're there by smelling their shoes...ridiculous. 3 - In most of the\nfilm the guy is feeling the walls and stumbling around the house as a\nblind person would normally have to, but he appears out of nowhere\nfairly quickly to corner the thieves...whatever. 4 - The guy has a\nperson trapped in his basement, yet he has an alarm to trigger the\npolice in case of a break-in...good Lord. 5 - Despite the lack of\nsterilization and proper obgyn attention, he impregnates this girl with\na basting syringe and sperm he keeps in a basement fridge...come on. I\ncould name more, but I'll stop there. Yeah...yeah...yeah, it wouldn't\nbe a thriller without those elements, you say? Nonsense. These are\nimplausible twisting of facts, yet most accept this as good, if not\ngreat, filmmaking. Please.\n"},

{"review": "\nDon't Breathe is a different kind of movie in the home invasion genre\nbecause it actually follows those who invaded in the first place\ngetting hunted.

{"review": "\nI was so stoked to see this movie. All the horror websites I visit all\nsaid it was awesome, can't miss it, must see, best\nhorror/suspense/thriller in years. Well I'll give them credit, it was\nsuspenseful. But not because of the acting, or the plot, or the\nsetting. It was suspenseful because you never knew what stupid thing\nthe main characters were going to do next. I was on the edge of my seat\nwaiting to see the next mistake. This movie was a joke. I have never\nbeen so disappointed with a movie I was so excited to see. After the\ngirl escaped the house and was pinned in the car by Cujo, you knew the\nBlind Man was going to get her again. I was amazed at how much trouble\nthese three people had with an old blind man. It doesn't matter that it\nwas in his environment. Who cares. It was an old blind man for gods\nsake. Once he killed the first guy all bets are off. You attack him.\nYou find something heavy, wait around a corner, set him up by making a\nlittle noise and BAM!!! hit him in the head. Get what u came for, and\nleave. They made this guy seem like Daredevil and Rambo rolled into\none, with a little bit of The People Under The Stairs thrown in there.\nI understand movies are not real life, they are stories. But this movie\nwas about something that could happen. This could be a real life\nscenario. But there were just too many stupid moments to take it\nseriously. You knew this was all make believe. You knew it was fake,\njust a story, just another movie. It was just a movie, and not a very\ngood one. If you want to get frustrated while watching something, then\nthis is the movie for you. If that doesn't sound like your idea of a\ngood time, to me it doesn't, I recommend skipping this flick. You're\nnot missing anything, unlike if you watch it, because then you'll miss\nabout 90 minutes of your life.\n"},
{"review": "\nDon't Breathe is certainly no Hitchcock or even a Guillermo del Toro\nfilm. The plot is implausible and far-fetched. It started out okay, but\nthen anyone who pays attention to details will notice its many flaws\nand goofs. Several of them have already been listed in the IMDb, but\nthe biggest flaw, I think, is about the dog. When the trio first comes\nto the house, the dog is chained. They drug the dog and he slumbers in\nhis dog house. Later, all of the sudden the dog is in the house. How\ndid he get rid of the chain and how did he get into the house? No doggy\ndoor, bars on the window, etc. Towards the end of the movie, when the\ngirl traps the dog in her car and tries to escape, the blind guy\ncatches her and drags her by the hair back to the house. He leaves his\ndog behind in the car? Obviously, the dog must have been barking. And\nwhen the girl finally does escape, there's no mentioning of the car or\nthe dog. The other plot twist I had a problem with is that the blind\nguy kidnaps the woman that supposedly killed his daughter in a car\naccident, impregnates her and thus wanting to replace his dead child.\nIt's ludicrous to think that a blind man could take of an infant. Even\nif the woman could have carried the child to term, how was she going to\ngive birth with a blind man as a midwife, in a cellar? The only\nexplanation for this part of the movie is that the blind guy was\nderanged. Oh, and yes, even though he was hit with a sledge hammer, he\nwas hardly injured. I don't understand the big hype about this\nso-called thriller. To me it's a bunch of crap. If you want to waste\nyour time and money, go see it and judge for yourself. You'd be better\nof watching a real thriller by Guillermo del Toro or one from the\nmaster himself, Alfred Hitchcock.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was looking forward to watching this film, but after the first 20\nminutes or so, I found myself shouting at the screen because of the\nridiculousness of it all. After the break in, and initially being HEARD\nby the blind guy, they spent half the time stood around like lemons and\nsneaking around. I must have counted 8 opportunity's for them to grab\nsomething and knock the guy<br><br>out, but did they, no. They proceeded to sneak around while be stalked\nby this guy who couldn't see. It took them until the last 15 minutes to\nactually find the brains to actually grab a weapon and hit him with it.\nIt was so comically unrealistic that it ruined the rest of the film for\nme, because it actually got better half way through once they got\ncaught. If you don't like unrealistic and clich\u00e9 films I would\nrecommend avoiding this one.\n"},

{"review": "\nIn my opinion, Don't Breath was the best movie of the summer. I went\nand seen it with some friends and at the end I wanted to replay the\nmovie. When I first seen the preview, I thought I was going to be\nscary. Turns out it's really not. Most of the parts in the movie that\nmade the audience scream and jump were just unexpected things that\npopped onto the screen quickly. I was impressed with the story line. I\nhad never heard of a movie even remotely similar and it took a lot of\ncreativity to create the story line they did. <br><br>Some things that I didn't really like where the killing of the\ncharacter \"Alex\" and the ending. The death of Alex was sad and made the\nentire movie theater upset. He was a good kid that was drawn to the\nwrong crowd by love. He went out defending the one he loved so I guess\nthat was a plus. At the end of the movie, the man ends up surviving and\nthe director sets the scenes up to let viewers believe there could be a\nsequel. The movie was already, there's no need to drag it on with a\nwhole new movie. <br><br>Some significant cinematography include but are not limited to:\nno-diegetic music, long Dutch angles and short clips that keep the\nviewers glued. In one scene, I enjoyed the actor's style. the blind man\nwas trying to find the kids in the dark. I think its cool that the\ndirector threw this in there.( he evened the playing field)the look and\nexpressions on the actors faces are priceless and could was interesting\nto see. <br><br>Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I would pay to watch it again. I don't\nfeel the need to mention specifics but the director had very effective\nways of making sure his film was remembered. go check it out !!!\n"},
{"review": "\nI went into this movie with some hope, as the idea was original, even\nif a bit hateful towards blind people.

No, kill them all. So the movie suddenly realises this 3/4\nof the way in and has to solve it, by somehow making the blind guy\nsuper evil. They do this with a disgusting sexual sidebar that makes\nyou literally want to vomit. This movie is all over the map. It wants\nto be a standard teen slasher movie, but it didn't bring enough\ndisposable teens to be murdered, so it makes them indestructible\ninstead, except for the first token kill. It wants to be a creepy\nsexual abduction movie, but we don't even get a hint of this direction\nuntil the movie is nearly over. I left greatly disappointed and very\nnauseated.\n"},

At one point of the\nmovie I am pretty sure everyone in the theater was grossed out and just\nwant to walk out and throw up. Don't watch this. This is not even a\ngood crime movie, it's a movie that would do anything to a stretch to\njust try to gross you out.

At\nleast give us a reason to give a damn about the main characters to get\ninvested in them. The characters decisions also made no sense, even for\na horror movie.

When they find out he is blind\nthey think it will be easy, but this is no ordinary blind man. This is\na movie that could have gone two ways. Super cheesy and clich\u00e9, or\ntense and original. For me, this was the latter. This is not a typical\nhorror movie in the way that it is not full of random jump scares or\npossessions. This is also, thankfully, not a \"found- footage\" or Saw\ntype horror where it relies on gore to scare you. This is movie a more\ntense Purge-like movie. 4 people are trapped inside a house where being\nthe last one standing is the only way out. This movie does add more and\nmore suspense and, surprises to keep it feeling fresh. The best part of\nthis movie though it that, unlike most recent horror, there is an\nactual story and character development. That aspect makes you question\nand wonder who you should root for.

The title is not just what the film revolves, it also for us to\nhold breath while watching it and most probably sitting on the edge of\nour seat throughout. But I'm very disappointed with many flaws, or\nmaybe you can say those unexplained stuffs. Like the end seems very\nsilly, because there were lots of evidence to prove the film character\nhad committed a crime, but easily got out. Likewise there are many\nmore, but the film does not explain and I believe there are sure\nreasons behind them.<br><br>The writers did not care to waste time on those, because they wanted\nonly a thriller, a non-stop one and they got one. Now it is going to be\nremade in Kollywood and also a sequel was announced. I expected that\nwhen I saw the ending. Maybe, a prequel, though sequel seems more\ninteresting idea after what happened in this. Surely one of the best\nthriller of the year, so make sure you watch it soon.<br><br>7/10\n"},
{"review": "\nThe ironic twist in the movie \"Don't Breathe\" is how it fails as a\nhorror film but still makes the same dramatic impact as \"The Silence of\nthe Lambs.\" Director Fede Alveraz, who also co-wrote the script, brings\na new villain to the screen. Steven Lang (Avatar) plays a blind,\nmilitary veteran who lives alone in an old, decrepit home and like\nHannibal Lecter, has no regard for human life. The vet also has a\nhorrifying secret in his basement which three young thieves (Jane Levy,\nDylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto) stumble upon while trying to steal\nthe old man's hush money. Although there is enough blood, ghastly shed,\nby the vengeful, ex-military man, the plot is so well written that our\ninterest shifts away from the gore to the intriguing story and the\nchills running up and down our spine disappear. The IMDb rating seems\nspot on but in my books, this movie deserves critical acclaim; I give\nit 9 out of 10.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen i saw the trailer for this movie it definitely didn't leave me\nwith the feeling that i needed to watch it immediately. But boy, was i\nwrong. From the first 10 minutes of the movie you can tell that it's\ngoing to keep you on edge until the end. For me it definitely did the\njob of keeping me in suspense throughout the whole movie. I can say\nit's one of the best scary movies i've seen in a really long time and i\nthink i've seen pretty much all of them. No scary ghosts or haunted\nhouses in this one, just a very realistic, dark situation that doesn't\nrequire the paranormal to make it scary and even a little bit creepy\nand dark. Both Fede Alvarez and Jane Levy smashed it three years ago\nwith Evil Dead and they did it again in this movie. For me Jane Levy\nit's an actress to keep your eyes on especially in the suspense, horror\nscene because she definitely has a clear talent for those roles. I\ntotally recommend this movie to all horror/suspense fans because you\nare definitely not going to be disappointed.\n"},
{"review": "\nI went to the cinema with my best friend to see this movie and I was\nreally disappointed. First, I don't think that we can call this an\n\"horror\" film: it wasn't scary at all. According to the scenario and\nthe trailer, I expected to feel oppress because of the ambiance and\nbecause of the fact that there is a blind and really dangerous old\nmilitary who tries to kill the thieves. However, the manner to film the\n\u00ab frightening \u00bb scenes doesn't make you feel \"in danger\" and it is\nquite sad for a horror and thriller movie. Second, I found the main\naction a little bit too long. The girl escapes and finally not and then\nshe escapes again,\u0085 It is always the same and, at the end, it is\nboring. Despite of that, I have to admit that the character of Rocky\n(Jane Levy) is really lovable. The fact that she steels money to go\naway from her alcoholic mother with her sister makes you love this girl\nand you really want to help her. In addition, there are a lot of new\nand unexpected elements which are added during the film and that is\nvery interesting because you know more about the blind man and you\nrealize that he is completely crazy. In conclusion, the general theme\nand the screenplay are quite good but I find the production\ndisappointing. I don't recommend you to go to the cinema to see it but\nit is a good entertainment to watch at home.\n"},

{"review": "\nA 7.6 rating on IMDb is incredibly high for a horror film. So when I\nsaw 'Dont Breathe' contained such a rating before going to see it, I\nsuspected I was in for something pretty special. Director Fede Alvarez'\none previous film, the 2013 remake of 'Evil Dead', was a very fine\nfilm. It was intense, scary and brutal. A new director stamping his\nmark on the genre from the outset. Could he live up to it a second time\nthough? I think you'd have to say he did. This time he takes on an\noriginal story (a breathe of fresh air in the horror genre) that he has\nwritten himself. It's an intriguing premise. A blind man being robbed,\nwho is more capable than first perceived and chooses to fight back.\nThen add in some extra twists and turns along the way and you have\nyourself a lot of potential. But we know that in this beloved genre of\nours potential doesn't always equal results.<br><br>Luckily Alvarez clearly has the filmmaking talents to pull it off. It's\na very different type of story to 'Evil Dead' and yet still captures\nthe same levels of intensity and brutality. One thing I didn't like was\nthe opening scene showing a man dragging a character down the road. I\nlove opening scenes that give a sneak preview into something that will\noccur later in the film when they are done right, but this simply\nwasn't. That type of a snippet should give the audience a \"Huh?\"\nfeeling or a \"How the hell are they going to make sense of that?\"\nthought. This one achieved neither of those. Other than that though\nthere really isn't a lot to criticise here. The acting is good, the\ndirecting is good and the whole experience is pretty damn enjoyable.\n7.6 to me implies it should be one of the best horror movies ever made.\nTo me it certainly didn't live up to that kind of level, but make no\nmistake, Alvarez is a director to take note of in the future.\n"},

I had no great\nexpectations but I was pleasantly surprised.<br><br>This is not a big budget movie and it depends heavily on the skill of\nthe actors to engage the audience and on the skill of the film crew to\nmake the most of claustrophobic spaces in the house where most of the\naction takes place. The plot is pretty thin but serves its purpose. The\nscore is never overpowering and the effects do not look like they\nneeded a Cray supercomputer (do they still exist?) to render crude\nvisuals that take you out of the action. Oh yes, and at 88 minutes you\ncan be assured the time is used to good effect and not just to add\nbloat.<br><br>A good efficient thriller with strong horror elements. Tense enough to\nkeep you gripped and short enough not to let you dwell on the plot\nholes. Give me this any day over the tedious blockbusters that\ncurrently monopolise the cinemas.\n"},

{"review": "\nI had heard some good things about Don't Breathe and decided to check\nit out. Overall, I think its a good popcorn flick. There were some good\ntension and a good twist but it was also wrought with clich\u00e9s and a\nstupid ending. One of the things I specifically liked was the\ndirection. I liked how the camera moved around the house and focused on\ndifferent items. For instance showing the audience early on where the\ngun was being hidden. It definitely added on another layer of tension\nbecause you would keep thinking things like \"Who's gonna get to the gun\nfirst?\". I think the movie also did a good job of making the main\ncharacters likable and wanting to root for them even though they are\ndoing something bad in the first place (robbery). The cast did well\nwith their roles. If I had to pick a standout I would go with Jane\nLevy. Now on to the stuff I didn't like. The \"aww shucks\" nice guy\nbeing in love with the main girl and she doesn't know it clich\u00e9. It's\nso overdone. And with Rocky's (Jane Levy) broken/abusive home life, I\nget its to bring sympathy to her character but it also feels contrived.\nKind of like the lazy, easy way of getting sympathy. And then the\nending\u0085.oh boy. I don't want to go in too much detail cause I'm trying\nto keep this as spoiler free as possible but, it just seemed to ignore\na lot of details that happened earlier and therefore didn't make a\nwhole of sense. If you're looking for a film that's going to flip the\nhorror genre on its head, this isn't it. If you're looking for a quick\nthrill ride, then this would be up alley\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw 'Don't Breathe' today with two of my friends, both of whom were\nseeing a 'horror' movie in a cinema for the first time. If they were\nlooking to not be terrified out their minds, then they most likely\nfound what they were (desperately) hoping for. Although the film\nindulges in some jump-scares, some of which get rather repetitive,\nthere was nothing of the 'Conjuring' or 'Sinister' ilk. Instead, the\nchilling moments in the film come from moments when the story strips\nback the ostensibly creepy atmosphere and exposes the bare brutality of\nthe blind man in his attempts to very punitively reprehend a trio of\nthieves who break in to his house. One scene stands out particularly\njarringly in that respect. The basic premise of the film was one which\nI believed held significant potential prior to viewing and I felt\nsufficiently rewarded for my presumptive belief. <br><br>Set in the urban desolation of Detroit, Michigan - coincidentally the\nbackdrop of what I consider to not be just one of the finest horror\nmovies of all time, but one of the best films in recent memory, 'It\nFollows' - one suspects that there is a real tale of moral and physical\ndecay at the heart of 'Don't Breathe'. Where 'Don't Breathe' falls far\nshort in comparison with 'It Follows' is a lack of exploration of this\nvery interesting theme; for too long, the film focuses on scaring you\nwith its admittedly spooky set pieces, and thus neglects a fully\nfledged characterisation of its protagonists and antagonist, both of\nwhom we gather to be victims of the stagnant economic and\ninfrastructural landscape of Detroit. There is rather forceful\nshoehorning in of some half-assed side-plots, but they are too much of\na side-show to have any relevance to the plot or poignance to the\naudience. <br><br>If what you seek is certainly an entertaining, thrilling view with some\nminor food for thought, then 'Don't Breathe' is the film for you.\n"},

{"review": "\nFede Alvarez's 2016 thriller film \"Don't Breathe\" is a simple but\neffective film that is void on dialogue but makes up for this with\nextremely well shot scenes and sound design that leads to a slow roll\nof dread for both the viewer and characters. The film has an extremely\nsmall cast consisting of about 5 characters, the highlights being\nStephen Lang who plays the blind man in the film, films like these rely\non the villain to be nerve racking and scary and Lang knocks this right\nout of the park with his depiction of the military vet turned harden\nblind man after his daughter is hit and killed by a car in an accident.\nThe other characters in the film Jane Levy (Rocky), Dylan Minnette\n(Alex) and Daniel Zovatto (Money also play their characters well with\nthe highlight being Rocky, Levy plays Rocky well as a strong\nindependent woman who don't need no man who can take care and think for\nself, although she does rely on Alex several times throughout the film.\nThe film does suffer in some area's such as in the lighting where\nduring the scenes filmed in the dark there are many gun shot flashes\nthat instantly hurt your eyes. The Film also steers away from greatness\nwhen you realise their is a very weak plot holding the movie together,\nthe plot was mainly just there to give a reason for the blind man to\nhunt down teenagers.

{"review": "\nThis movie is absolutely relentless. It quickly sets up its characters\nand then jumps straight into the plot.

I really enjoy\ncontained movies, where the characters are locked in a house or a\nbuilding and they have to make do with the things surrounding them. And\nthat's what Don't Breathe does.

Contrary to what the title\nsuggests, this guy can't even tell where these kids are from their\nheavy breathing and even when he does sense them his aim is terrible.\n2- Those kids had literally a hundred opportunities to whack this guy\non the head.

If you were a police officer,\nwho is the first person you're going to investigate? 4- And how the\nheck was he STILL not found out, at the end of the movie when the cops\ncame to clear up the bodies and searched the house?

However, Don't Breathe ended up\nbeing a very competent film, and much better than most of the movies\nbelonging to this sub-genre. The first act of Don't Breathe takes the\nnecessary time to introduce the characters and establish their nature\nand relationships with each other. Unlike other \"home invasions\", the\ncharacters aren't assigned easy roles of heroes and villains; on the\nopposite, our perception changes as new details get revealed, until\nreaching a logical and satisfactory ending... with a small touch of\nbitterness to remind us that life rarely has absolute levels of good\nand bad people. The characters evolve sometimes brusquely and sometimes\ngradually, generating quite a suspense and achieving an exciting and\nvery entertaining experience. Don't Breathe doesn't have the slightest\ntrace of dramatic filler; every scene tells us something, and every\nmovement is carefully planned for us not to lose the sense of time and\nspace in the claustrophobic house. I wouldn't consider it an excellent\nfilm, but I liked Don't Breathe pretty much, and I definitely consider\nit worthy of a recommendation. The previous (and first) film of\ndirector Fede \u00c1lvarez (the remake of Evil Dead) had been moderately\nentertaining, but mediocre; however, he displays much more potential\nwith Don't Breathe, and I will definitely will be expecting his future\nfilms with interest.\n"},

Well, sorry, but\nthat just doesn't cut it. He's wasting his time trying to justify their\nactions, because there's no justification, so he should've at least\nmade them lovable rogues, by having them be witty.

{"review": "\nDon't Breathe (2016): Dir: Fede Alvarez / Cast: Stephen Lang, Jane\nLevy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, Jane Graves: Shocking horror film\nwith a title that brings light to the nearness of evil. Jane Levy,\nDylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto play Rocky, Alex and Money\nrespectably. They are aiming to blow town for California and rob houses\nfor priceless items to pond off. They target a house in an abandoned\nneighborhood that is owned by Norman Nordstrom, a blind army veteran.\nThe three thieves aim to steal a fortune he has stashed but get more\nthan they bargained for. After putting his attack dog to sleep they\nsearch for the money only to awaken Norman. After killing Money, Alex\nand Rocky struggle to survive a brutal set of events that lead them\ninto the basement where further dire discoveries are made that address\nthe vengeful nature of Norman. He is played by Stephen Lang whose lack\nof sight allows for keen hearing and a decent aim. His daughter was\nkilled by a drunk driver and the guilty was set free due to wealth. The\nresult of this brings frightening insight into his mental stability and\nhis raging desire to restore what is lost. Director Fede Alvarez\npreviously made the gruesome remake to Evil Dead. Here the violence is\nalso extreme but not nearly as graphic. It contains a strong theme\npresenting one's desire for riches and the consequences for coveting.\nLang is menacing as Norman whose skill has limitations. Levy discovers\nher mistakes way to late and their impact upon others resulting in her\nbeing dragged by the hair down the vacant street reflecting how she got\nthere in the first place. Score: 9 / 10\n"},
{"review": "\nAs many people told already, the least you know about the movie, the\nmore you end up enjoying it. I for one went in knowing absolutely\nnothing but the name, and while I'm not a big fan of the genre, I found\nthis title to be superb. To give as few information as possible, the\nstory begins when three amateur thieves attempt a robbery inside a\nhouse inhabited by a blind man and his lovely dog, thinking it'd be an\neasy target, but then things start going awfully wrong for them.<br><br>Truth be told, it's pleasant to see titles not going over supernatural\nbased-on-real-facts-yet-truly-unbelievable kind of stuff (yes, I'm\nlooking at you The Conjuring) for a change. A great film worth watching\nand with very few flaws.\n"},
{"review": "\nDon't Breathe is not an easy movie to watch, nor is it a pleasant one.\nThese attributes do not hurt the movies quality or take away from Fede\nAlvarez's talent.<br><br>The director first emerged with his mainstream debut, a remake of Evil\nDead, which succeeded in being different than the original and still a\nfantastic movie. His next step was Don't Breathe a movie that centers\naround three teen robbers that break into an old blind man's house as\none last job before they leave the run down Detroit. This all goes\nhorribly wrong when the Old Man is more powerful then he appears to be\nand a deadly game of Cat and Mouse is played.<br><br>Just like with Evil Dead, Fede has directed a movie that can be viewed\nin both ways that any Good horror movie can be viewed. An experience\nthat scares and also encourages you to cheer on the likable characters\nas they dodge the deadly killer. The movie is claustrophobic and has\nsome of the best jump scares ever seen in film. This is not a movie\nthat relies on loud organs and screams to fright as the movie makes you\nfeel as trapped and hurt as the main characters. <br><br>Now to the last twenty minutes of the movie which is sure to be water-\ncooler talk for the next week. The movie has one of the most tense\nscenes ever in a film. It is a very provocative scene and will make\nsome uncomfortable to the point of walking out of the theater. The high\noctane scene also makes the climax of the movie a little weak by\ncomparison and it goes out on a whimper instead of a bang. <br><br>Don't Breathe is worth a watch, even if you might have to step out of\nthe theater for certain parts. This is a movie for fans of Green Room,\nEvil Dead, or any good slasher flick.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is great if you have a strong stomach and love a good\nsuspenseful movie with action, and jump scares. This movie is\ndefinitely worth seeing,however turns from suspenseful,and scary to\nGrose, which may turn off a lot of viewers. This movie is probably one\nof the most suspenseful I've witnessed in the last few years, but one\nof the grossest as well. Bottom line if you can handle Grose and\nsuspenseful jump scares this is the movie for you. Overall I thought\nDon't Breath was a great story,and intense almost all the way through.\nThe movie starts off slow, and then slowly gets more interesting,and\nintense by the minute. Don't Breathe starts off with Teenagers thinking\nthey have a good shot of Robing this blind old man, when little do they\nknow this guy is the wrong twisted guy to mess with. Midway through the\nmovie it seems like the old man is useless, but that isn't the case.\nDon't Breathe is one of the best horror movies I've saw all year, and\ngrossest. So if you like Grose and scary go see this movie! Why is this\nmovie so interesting? The story line, and the suspense with it. Why is\nthis movie not in some areas? Well that's easy! It can get really\nunpleasant in some spots of the movie near the end. If the movie wasn't\ntwisted I think this would hands down be the best horror movie of the\nyear because it includes every aspect of an awesome horror movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI knew basically nothing other than hearing it was a \"home invasion\"\nhorror film. I intentionally didn't read anything on it or watch any\ntrailers, and thank goodness. It safely continues the trend of great\nhorror this year. Wickedly brutal, bonkers crazy, and so, so\nridiculous. That last thing is said with absolute love and glee though.\nLike 10 Cloverfield Lane earlier this year, it knows it's basically a\nB-flick in every sense of the word and Fede Alvarez runs away with it.\nThe film never actually turns into a comedy horror film because it's\nnever that obvious, and yet you can sense the filmmakers laughing with\nglee while making it. The filming and directing itself is really well\ndone. Although it doesn't hit the the genre highs that Green Room (a\nfilm that is also similar in its frenzied and feverish pacing and\nnarrative) hit, it still does so much justice to this genre. The acting\nitself is also pretty good, with Jane Levy continuing to be the MVP and\ncontinuing her talent from Evil Dead. She and Alvarez make a great\nteam.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie generated a lot of hype in it's early screenings, and the\ntrailer seemed to promise a tense and violent romp. It definitely\ndelivered lots of nerve-wrackingly tense moments that had the theater\njumping without necessarily using the classic \"jump scare\" tactic. The\nacting was good, and all of the characters were well- written enough to\nhave a lot of likable and unlikable moments, which was a nice break\nfrom usual horror stereotypes. I can see how people would be praising\nit as a horror masterpiece because it definitely was scary without\nbeing clich\u00e9. It was a lot of fun to watch in theaters.<br><br>So if I have so much positive feedback, why give it a six instead of\nsomething higher? The reason is there were at least two very obvious\nplot holes to me while watching that were never resolved. The beginning\nof the movie made me somewhat dislike the main characters, who seemed\nto lack any real intelligence until they're actually trying to survive\nin the house. The ending was about three scenes too long, and the whole\n\"evil guy never dies and is also able to be everywhere at once\"\nmechanic begins to wear a little thin by the end of the movie.<br><br>Also, there is THAT one scene. Get ready for it. Do not make the same\nmistake I did and think that the popularity of the movie meant there\nwould not be one extremely weird and disturbing moment that would make\nyou regret bringing your mother along with you. I personally love the\nweird and slightly obscene in horror movies, but this one does nothing\nto prepare you for what is to come. Maybe if I had walked into the\ntheater with a different mindset, this movie would have been more\nsuccessful for me.\n"},
{"review": "\nHorror movies continue to impress as Don't Breathe arrives to finish\noff late summer at the movies. This thriller follows three criminals\nwho break into houses until they break into the wrong one.

Her\nboyfriend, Money (Daniel Zovatto) hears about a blind veteran who\nreceived a large sum of money from a settlement after his daughter died\nin a car accident. Alex (Dylan Minnette) uses his dad's security guard\nkeys to gain access to houses though this particular location proves\nmore difficult with a vicious dog and an inordinate amount of locks.<br><br>Stephen Lang is ferocious as the blind man with dark secrets of his\nown. Lang stalks through the house creating a horrifying villain\nwithout any supernatural help.The acting was great from the three main\nactors. Dylan Minnette has graduated from the young Goosebumps film to\na more adult horror and I hope he continues work in the genre. Jane\nLevy has shown promise with her appearance in Evil Dead and looks to\nhave a bright future as a young actress.

{"review": "\nI will say the idea of a blind man getting robbed is appalling and sad\nbut i will say for the purposes of the film, it seems to work. The\nstory deals with a trio of robbers Alex, rocky, and money steal items\nfrom peoples homes and selling them. Rocky wants to take her sister\naway from their neglectful mother. The trio discover a blind war\nveteran who won a wrongful death settlement as a result of his\ndaughters death. The trio think it might be an easy score but little do\nthey now the blind man is not as helpless as he appears and are forced\nin a battle of survival. I will say while some parts were predictable\nand laughable but it was a decent film for what it was\n"},
{"review": "\nI went in to this film not expecting to feel scared or frightened, but\noh was I wrong. This film manages to frighten you with just the dead\nsilence. Another thing that this film does well is conflict your\nallegiance with the three main characters. At first, all three of the\nmain characters come off as inconsiderate punks who have no regard for\nthe people they steal from, but as the story progresses when they rob\nthe blind man, you sort of hope they make it out alive when you see how\nmonstrous the blind man can be.<br><br>Only drawbacks to this film are some basic logical fallacies.\nAdditionally, I thought the film makers may have over-exaggerated the\nblind man's abilities. Other than that, I recommend watching this film.\nIt is definitely better than the average horror movie these days.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was really excited about this film but it was the most predictable,\nstupid and cringe worthy film I've seen in a long time.Its your typical\ncrap slasher movie, like of course its the woman alive at the end and\nthe guy practically sacrifices himself for her. HE'S BLIND FOR GOD\nSAKE, there was so many times they could have just walked up to him and\nsmacked him with a plank of wood or something, and why did the gas not\nknock him out? AND THE DOG!!! don't get me started - that thing turns\nup every now and again when it suits the director and apparently can't\nrun faster than a beat up man or woman. The ending was pathetic on the\npolice report saying an innocent old man was attacked in his home, SO\nWHAT ABOUT HIS DUNGEON AND THE MESSED UP SWING TRAP IN THE BASEMENT???\nThey miss that did they? Way too many holes in the story and frankly\nlaughable scenes.\n"},
{"review": "\nSaw this last Sunday with my dad n son in theatre. It was on my\nwatchlist for a very long time. It is a tense thriller. It is really\nintense, terrifying and with plenty of twists and turns. The script is\nbrilliant and provided a perfect ingredient for a fast paced thriller.\nActing was decent. Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette was great to watch. The\nfrustration, anger, fear and desperation was portrayed well by these\nactors. Stephen Lang did a fantastic job as a blind army veteran which\nwent well with his muscular body and heavy voice. Direction was\nawesome. Fede Alvarez did an awesome job. The idea of showing certain\nthings which would play a key role later in the movie as the burglars\nenter the house was great. Some scenes were very well shot inspite of\nbeing in dark. U can feel that it's dark but as audience u know what's\ngoing on. The cinematography was very good by Pedro Luque. The\nbackground score by Roque Banos is one of the highlight. The editing\nwas top notch. Eric L. Beason, Louise Ford n Gardner Gould did a\nfantastic job. It grossed over $90 million against a $9.9 million\nbudget. Wow. Speaks volume. Movies which audience may find similar-\nPanic room, Wait until dark, The Collector, Livid. Sam Raimi n Fede\nAlvarez did a wonderful job of satisfying thriller fans.\n"},

{"review": "\nEnding the summer season in horror style, Don't Breathe is about three\nteenagers robbing houses where they come across a blind army veteran\nwho has quite a lot of money, but not all as it seems because this\nblind man...is Stephen Lang. The same Stephen Lang who tried to destroy\nPandora in Avatar...you just know what you are getting yourself\ninvolved in. Right from the opening scene, the tension is building and\nthroughout the 88 minute runtime the suspense just does not stop. This\nis simply edge of your seat cinema, less horror but more thriller. The\nperformances were great, obviously Stephen Lang is a badass (I mean\nwhat were the teenagers thinking!? Don't mess with him!) but the\nrobbers themselves played understated performances, each character with\ntheir own backstory which were developed enough. The direction from\nFede Alvarez just oozed confidence, he knew exactly what he wanted to\ndo and he did it. Excellent camera work (a nice long shot near the\nbeginning of the film, I was impressed!), great lighting to create the\natmosphere and good editing to create those jump scares. Speaking of\njump scares, there are a few of them however I would not class this\nfilm as a horror, it is more a thriller. I was not scared (and to be\nhonest, no one in my cinema was either) but we were all on the edge of\nour seats. Whilst some might find that a flaw, if anything it is just a\nmisrepresentation of the movie. One flaw that this film does have is\nthat all the characters are bad people and therefore not likable, which\nmeans it is difficult to become attached to them. Overall, Don't\nBreathe was a great suspenseful thriller with sublime technical aspects\nand\u00a0brilliant performances albeit if the characters are not likable.<br><br>- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com\n"},
{"review": "\nI don't understand where the high rating is coming from. How can a\nhorror movie fan enjoy basically a self-defense shooting movie so much?\nThere's no likable characters here, and the potential source of fear is\na very regular although strong human being. Yes, he is off in his idea\nof revenge, but he measures his cruelty which is unlikely for thriller,\nisn't it? What is \"horror\" about it? Sheldon Cooper's problems were\nmore \"horror\" than this. I think one reviewer here said it best: \"Don't\nBreathe is a grisly, unpleasant exploitation film about characters that\nyou don't like going up against a man who is at first somewhat\nsympathetic and then turns out to be a ridiculous mess of a (human)\nmonster, and it's directed with some skill.\"\n"},
