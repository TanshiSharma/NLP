{"review": "\nAn effective thriller with a good twist in the ending. Not since The\nSixth Sense has a movie given me such a surprise at its ending. Liam\nNieson keeps your attention fixed on the action throughout the movie,\nalthough some of his lines did not match the scenes or his character.\nIf someone is trying to kill you, maybe some emotion would be shown.\nThe car accident at the beginning is very realistic and makes Liams\namnesia credible. The car chase scenes in the movie will also keep the\naction buffs happy, although the black car driven by the assassin is a\nbit too corny to believe . Bruno Ganz as an aging former Stasi agent\ngives a stand-out performance and Diane Kruger supports Nieson without\nthe usual Hollywood theme of girl following for hero. Maybe its because\nNieson is old enough to be her father. This film is no masterpiece but\nif your looking for a couple of hours entertainment with an interesting\nending this will fit the bill.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's one thing to be told not to think too hard about what you're about\nto see, it's another to be helped enormously in that task by a skilled\ndirector employing equally skilled actors.

Probably not, but it's devilishly entertaining.\nThe action scenes here are matched by the quiet drama scenes and that's\nunusual.

{"review": "\nThe movie sounds intriguing since from the beginning and keeps its\nsense of mystery and intrigue till the end: this is a good quality,\nonce reminding Hitchcock's thrillers, with the difference that in\n\"Unknown\" the thrilling aspect cannot be separated from the frenzy\ntypical of action movies. The result is an entertaining, involving pic,\nnever losing its strong and quick rhythm and letting the viewer staying\nattached to the screen till the end. Set in a depressing Berlin covered\nby snow, always marked by the sad signs of a more or less distant past,\na good photography gets to capture the overall gloomy atmosphere of the\nstory and the mystery of a character whose vicissitudes seem as much\nincomprehensible as much needing some resolution, and an effective\nfinal twist as well. Liam Neeson plays skillfully, although not always\nsufficiently expressive, he gets to convey the sense of void of someone\nlooking for some identity. A stand-out performance is offered by Bruno\nGanz and also Diane Kruger supports Neeson quite well. Certainly not a\nmasterpiece, but worth the ticket.\n"},
{"review": "\nGood movie. The plot seemed similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1990\nscience - fiction action movie, Total Recall. If you were to change\nsci-fi action thriller to foreign intrigued mystery action thriller,\nchange locations, Mars to Berlin, change Ronny Cox to Frank Langella,\nchange free oxygen for all on Mars to lower cost corn development on\nEarth and change revolutionary hero, Quato to revolutionary scientist,\nDr. Bessler. Total Recall was made nearly 20 years ago, many people may\nnever have seen it or forgot about it. Retelling a story in Hollywood\nis nothing new in order to gain a contemporary audience. Maybe I'm\nwrong about the similarities, yet on it's own, Unknown is a very good\naction movie thriller and Liam Neeson has successfully step into action\nadventure characters with vengeance.\n"},

Not a bad thing if you're an actor (because you'll get more work\nand more money), but it can get tiresome for the audience. Fortunately,\nI'm not one of them. I enjoy Neeson in just about everything I see him\nin. Good for me and good for him as I'm sure the majority of\nmovie-goers would agree.<br><br>Unknown is all three Bourne movies tied up in one. It's great for those\nthat don't have the patience for a long wrap-up. There is a lot of\ndetective work and very little action; however, when there is action,\nit is good, including a hair-raising car chase. The ending is weak, but\nhey, it's Hollywood. When was the last time you saw a great ending?\nUnknown is worth 8-9 bucks. Just be glad there isn't a 3D version for\nyou to pay $15 for.\n"},
{"review": "\nAnyone who has watched Liam Neeson's movies have grown accustom to a\ncharacter that is always thrown into absurd situations but can still\nsomehow use wit, power and skills to get himself out.

I enjoy how Liam is believable in these roles and you\nforget that he's getting up there in age, if anything, he makes it seem\nlike this is what any man his age is capable of. He is awaken from a\ncoma to discover that his identity has been taken by someone else.\nWorst yet, his wife doesn't seem to recognize him. With the help of the\nwoman that saved his life, in a country that is not his home, Liam\nseeks about to prove himself.

The story itself is utterly ridiculous\nand presents itself through the use of computer generated turns of plot\nwith a car chase here and a fist fight there exactly on queue. The fact\nthat Harris finds an attractive young female to aid his quest to find\nout what is happening to him, redefines this particular movie clich\u00e9. I\nhope someone finds the time to reprogram the software responsible for\nthis nonsense or to decompile it altogether.\n"},
{"review": "\nSo this movie was by far the worst this year. It is so poorly written\nwith plot holes galore. The idea was good though ripped off from other\nmovies but the actions taken from the actors to achieve their goals\nwere ridiculous and made it so when the mystery was revealed i was so\ntaken out of the movie that I didn't care. It seemed like twenty\nminutes to long and by the end (which was so bad and made no sense why\nit happened that way)Not worth the money I spent and I really wish i\nwaited until it came DVD so i could of paid a dollar at the red box for\nit. Save yourself the trip and the money and hopefully Liam picks a\nbetter project next time.\n"},
{"review": "\nI asked 11 people to watch this movie and pause it after 45 minutes and\ntry to think of a scenario to explain what has happened. Not one person\ncould do it. I couldn't either. In the last 30 minutes of the movie you\nare given a perfect explanation to describe the events. This movie is\nextremely clever and very well done. I thought it was one of the 5 best\nmovies of the year. If you think you are good at analyzing movies and\nforeseeing endings, I challenge you to figure out where this movie is\nheading. The ending is unpredictable and very rewarding. If you are a\nfan of Liam Neeson, this movie is a must see. I've watched it six times\nand I am still pulled into on each viewing.\n"},

{"review": "\nVery well made with some very slick editing keeping the pace pretty\nhigh all the way through.

To be fair though, there are a few seedier\nparts of the city shown as well. All the main cast played their parts\nwell with Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger standing out. I also enjoyed the\nperformance of Bruno Ganz as the ageing former Stazi agent and it was\nnice to see Frank Langella as Martin's old colleague, Rodney Cole. Over\nall, a decent watch that doesn't really break any new ground but does\nwhat it says on the tin (and I can't knock it for that).<br><br>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br><br>My score: 7.0/10.<br><br>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of\na SteelMonster.\n"},

{"review": "\nVery exciting film. I am particularly fond of 'european' touch and\natmosphere presented, being living in the eastern Europe, film looked\nvery domestic and familiar.

The story was original up to a\nfair point, and kept all of my attention throughout entire film. The\nacting of a lead actor is natural as always, and supporting characters\nare also good, although pushed into a second plan; with no artificial\nkindness of any sort in between (Gina: \"Why did you have to be in my\nTaxi!?\"; or Ernst:\"The Money!\").<br><br>The 4-day vacuum, gloomy outlook for the lead and general suspense were\ndominant feelings for less then 2 hours of a great adventure.

{"review": "\nQuite an amazing script this one... The movie starts intriguing, but\nwhile the movies moves on, the script becomes more and more\nunbelievable.

He keeps his formula only on\nhis laptop, so this laptop needs to be destroyed... a world saving\nformula is stored only on a laptop, and not on a server or in the\ncloud, amazing, isn't it?

{"review": "\nLet me tell you, I love Liam Neeson. he is a fantastic actor,\nespecially with action films. i mean, i loved the A-Team, but\napparently, my favorite of his work goes to Love Actually.

The way that the character Liam\nNeeson plays of trying to find out who he really is, has an interesting\nvibe to it that keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what's\ngoing to happen next. Plus, the action scenes they show is well shot,\nand gives you that adrenalin rush that good actions films give us.

{"review": "\nI thought this movie would have a big 'twist' but having seen the whole\nBourne trilogy plus the original Bourne Identity, as well as Nowhere\nMan, this movie seemed incredibly derivative.

Lots and lots of long drawn out car chasing. Villains always\non their heels. Lots of fighting. It also kind of reminded me of\nanother movie of Leeson - i.e., Taken, which is also one big long\nchase. So between the plot being so derivative, and the similarities\nwith Taken, this just didn't have much new or interesting for me. Also,\nwhile the lost/stolen identity plot worked well in earlier works along\nthese lines, it really seemed out of touch with current information\ntechnology, which made it even easier to figure out the 'twist' than it\nwould otherwise have been.\n"},
