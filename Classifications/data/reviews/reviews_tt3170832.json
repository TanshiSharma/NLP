{"review": "\nI was lucky enough to see an advanced screening for this film. I had a\ntoss up between two films to see and I chose this one based on the\ntrailer and generally positive reviews (who likes to waste their time\nwith bad movies). <br><br>Wow.<br><br>This is one of those rare feats in filmmaking. The cinematography is\ngreat, but see this for the acting and the story. Not often has a movie\nmade me cry, laugh, and shout out (aloud mind you) during the films run\ntime. I don't want to spoil much of the story as it becomes obvious\nearly on, what is actually going on. The magnificence of this film is\nin how the director was able to tackle the difficult subject matter in\na way that doesn't leave you feeling like you saw an average\nthriller/horror movie, but really out it in perspective of the child,\nwhich I believe had a humanistic approach. It was amazing. Best movie\nof 2015, by a long shot and they're were great movies this year. (Im\nlooking at you exmachina) <br><br>Not only I, but I feel absolutely everyone who left the theater left a\nbetter person for what they witnessed. Not often do I come out of the\ntheater with people being more polite than they were upon entering.\nTHAT is the power this movie has, I emerged myself in the experience\nand I'm glad I did, because \"No one is strong alone\", certainly not I,\nand I have a more profound idea of appreciation of my own life and\nexistence til death. I will continue on my quest but I know that I will\nnever forget this landmark film, what it taught me, and how it humbled\neveryone in the theater.\n"},
{"review": "\nI know one thing, I will never, ever forget this heartrending,\nunbelievably-acted 'movie' for the rest of my days. I'm just at a loss\nfor words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and\nheart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if you\ndon't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or\nwhile) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson)\nand her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The\nbeauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally\nrelatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep,\ndeep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears;\nsometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It\nmade me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had\nmy eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was\nwitnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and\none of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read\nmuch/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely\ncatch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved\n(in ways I can't describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the\nbest film of 2015, and the single best thing I've seen in years. :')\n"},
{"review": "\n*Insert all 9 &amp; 10 reviews here* I was in awe during the entire film.\nLenny Abrahamson &amp; the writing team made sure there was not one dull\nmoment. The addition of \"insignificant\" characters and plot twists are\nlater realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film\nalive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made this\nstory one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entire\npalette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of\ncuriosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to\ninfluence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most\nbeautiful way.\n"},
{"review": "\nRoom (2015/I) was directed by Lenny Abrahamson. It stars Jacob Tremblay\nas Jack and Brie Larson as his mother (\"Ma\")<br><br>The situation becomes very clear early in the film. Jack and his mother\nare held captive by a man who has kidnapped her, raped her, impregnated\nher, and uses her as his sexual slave. Jack and his mother have lived\nin a small, locked shed, which they call \"Room.\" Jack's mother has\nlived in \"Room\" since she was abducted seven years earlier. Jack has\nlived there for all of his life--five years.<br><br>By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from\nrealizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that\nanyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe\nthat his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept\nit.<br><br>What happens next is pretty well known, but I won't go into it because\nit might decrease your enjoyment of the movie. It's dramatic,\nfrightening, and, heart-wrenching, all at the same time.<br><br>Brie Larson does a wonderful job as the mother, and Jacob Tremblay has\nto be the best child actor we have. He is absolutely brilliant.\nDirector Abrahamson must be an extremely talented man to draw two such\ngreat performances from his actors.<br><br>This is a must-see film, but it's not easy to watch. Even though Room\nwasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of cases of warped\nmen who have kidnapped and enslaved women. It's hard to think about the\nlives of those women without becoming depressed. <br><br>We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Given\nthe claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie, it will work on the small\nscreen as well. Seek it out and watch, but prepare yourself mentally\nbefore you begin.\n"},
{"review": "\nBased on the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, 'Room' is a\nchallenging, unsettling, harrowing film, that leaves you disturbed. But\nthat is its sheer power.

Of the supporting\ncast, Joan Allen &amp; The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark.<br><br>On the whole, 'Room' is a must watch! Its certainly unsettling, but its\npower is undeniable.\n"},
{"review": "\nDon't listen to the haters or those that want to chip away at the\noverall brilliance of 'Room'. What film doesn't have small flaws, they\npale into insignificance during the 2 hours of continuous emotional\nmaelstrom that follows. This film wrings every last drop of emotion and\ndrama out of the allotted playtime. Make no mistake, despite short\nbursts of touching serenity, this films starts up full throttle and\ndoesn't let-up. I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or\nless must be Vulcan by birth, or just terminally insensitive. This is a\nfirst rate drama with stand out performances all round. Especially from\nthe child protagonist. <br><br>**Warning** If you have trouble viewing emotionally charged material of\na sensitive nature about abuse. You would be well advised not to view\nthis film.\n"},
{"review": "\nToo many tears, too much sadness. Story of a teenager Ma kidnapped,\nraped and made a mom. And mom and son Jack locked in a room away from\nthe world. Really sad when Jack said I don't want to be 5 I want to be\n4. Even a 5 year old wants continued happiness in simplicity and in the\narms of his only friend his own mother. He wants to be breast fed , he\nwants to shower with his Ma. He enjoys the only place he knows for his\nfirst 5 yrs of his life. There is no chaos from the real person he\nknows. Ma wants Jack to rescue them from the room. Life outside the\nroom has its' own problems of tears, cries, fights.<br><br>Excellent writing by Emma Donoghue who wrote the novel and the\nscreenplay. Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother Ma are\nterrific. Every scene, every dialogue has sincerity. Oscar worthy\nscreenplay. Oscar worthy acting . Joan Allen as Ma's mom and Jack's\ngrandma is perfect grandma, loving, caring, sensitive and excellent.\nDefinite Oscar nominees. Jacob Tremblay , so young and so perfect in\nevery scene.\n"},
{"review": "\nI haven't seen a genuinely emotional, smart, non-manipulative, heart-\nfelt drama in a loooong time. Brie Larson deservedly won an Oscar for\nher performance in this, but Room should've swept the board in every\ncategory.<br><br>The film centres on a Mother and her five year old son, living inside\njust four walls, and it slowly transpires that she has been held\ncaptive for seven years, and had a child by her kidnapper. She creates\na world for her son within their confines, not telling him the truth\nabout their situation and what's outside until he's old enough to\nunderstand. After failed escape attempts in the past, but now with the\nhelp of her son, she gives freedom another try.<br><br>There were moments in Room that were so intense that I barely breathed.\nIt never feels inauthentic, and thanks to incredible acting, it's\nalways believable. If you want a straight-up thriller of 'bad guy\ncommits crime, bad guy gets comeuppance', you'll be disappointed. This\nis about human resilience, the bond between Mother and child,\nselflessness, and finding your place in the world after having your\nunderstanding of it flipped upside down.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie has some issues with pacing (way too slow for me), annoying\nhand-held camera and lack of good score that is ESSENTIAL to carry a\nmovie that is slow paced and takes place in a single room.<br><br>The kid is easily the best part in this movie. He is very good in his\nrole and could have been nominated for a high-ranked award. I also\nliked Tom McCamus. Very nice low-key role. I thought I knew him from\nsomewhere (and not just because he looks like Lou Reed) - He was in\nPOSSIBLE WORLDS (great movie), got pretty old since then.<br><br>The movie is slow and simple. I expected a much smarter plot. The lead\nactress is OK, but I don't think it's Oscar material.\n"},
{"review": "\nUnique story line, moving, and great acting. The kid gives a beautiful\nand very convincing performance, especially during the more emotional\nscenes. But after they escape, it's mostly just melodrama where the\ndaughter accuses the Dad of not caring and the mom says the daughter is\ninconsiderate of her feelings, etc. 2/3 of this film is very\nreminiscent of some sappy ABC Family drama, like The Fosters. If you\nare a fan of The Fosters, you might enjoy Room, as the two are equally\nas boring. I also dislike the way this movie antagonizes journalists\nand portrays them as close-minded vultures. During the interview, the\nreporter seems to victim-blame and provoke Brie Larson's character,\nwhich is something no professional, ethical reporter would do under\nthat context in real life.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe first 45 minutes or so of \"Room\" are awful to sit through. While\nthose minutes are crucial to the rest of the story, seeing how a grown\nwoman and her five-year-old son survive while locked inside a 10ft. by\n10ft. outdoor shed is a tough task for any viewer. Director Lenny\nAbrahamson and screenwriter Emma Donoghue, adapting her own novel, free\nthe captives (and the audience) before too long--and yet, mother and\nson's new life in the suburbs is nearly as uninteresting as life in\nthat shed (I'm not sure this is intentional). Thankfully, Brie Larson's\nOscar-winning performance as the exhausted, anxious (and guilt-ridden)\nsingle mom facing a strange new world is riveting on occasion, while\nthe (not implausible) center of the story--an awakening, if you\nwill--is emotional, if never quite fascinating. As an acting exercise\nfor this cast, the material must have looked like a godsend. Abrahamson\nis careful with his actors; he allows them to think and breathe and\nhurt and heal. But all this drama could take its toll on an impatient\naudience, so personal judgment will have to dictate whether or not the\nmovie is a success. **1/2 from ****\n"},
{"review": "\nI have been waiting to see this movie for months. I read the book one\nholiday and found it gripping and haunting. Sadly, the film did not\nachieve the level of drama that the novel had in abundance. My husband\n(who has not read the book and knew nothing of the story) was in\nagreement. So many missed opportunities to look into the minds and\nemotions of these characters. The acting was fine but far too much of\nwhat made the book so fascinating was skimmed over and I'm not sure\nwhy..... I was particularly disappointed by the characterisation of\n'Old Nick' (mid-cast, I feel, and we see little of his confused and\nconfusing state of mind. Jack's relationship with the objects in the\nhouse is skimmed over and the conflicts of the grandparents were simply\nalluded to rather than properly explored.

{"review": "\nNow, I don't think it was bad, thought it was ehh , I just wish the\nfilmmaker had done more. Never while in Room did I get the sense of\nclaustrophobia to emphasize just how tiny the area that the characters\nwere in was (which really makes the fact that they actually filmed in\nthat tiny area pretty pointless), or hopelessness, and imprisonment, to\nhighlight the unbelievable amount of time that they've been there;\nInstead, we are just told this information. In addition, due to not\nreally getting what situation these characters were in, made it really\nunderwhelming when they made their rather fortunate escape; there was\nno feeling of awe at this, seemingly, new and strange environment (like\nin Oldboy, The Hurt Locker,and The Descent), and it's clear with the\nslow-mo, and shots of Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) face that was what they\nwere attempting.<br><br>Aside from what I'd wish they'd done, there were also some questionable\nand unfitting music choices throughout, and two scenes: during and\nimmediately following the escape.

And though I thought Jacob Tremblay was\ngood, for a kid, I didn't think his performance was amazing or award\nworthy, like I had heard previous to watching Room. Just because his\nperformance was better than most child performances doesn't mean it's\ngreat.<br><br>I appreciated the way they decided to take the story, and I liked the\nway Brie's character's struggles were handled, and to be honest, that's\nit.<br><br>With all this pessimism, it may be hard to believe that I didn't hate\nthis film, but I didn't; I just thought it was meh.

I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and was hoping the\npsychological aspects of the film would step up in the second half but\nit didn't do so, the second half completely changes the situation for\nworse, there are new problems to deal with and the movie goes about\nthem in it's usual half committed way which was prevalent in first\nhalf.

It seems that the reality TV fad has passed\nonto fiction. I recall the early Big Brother series and people watching\nwhile celebrities lay snoring in bed. This is the fictional equivalent.\n"},

It is a story of five years old Jack and his Mother,\nMa who live together in a room. Young actor Jacob Tremblay played the\nrole of Jack.

When he became five, she revealed and\ntried to convince him about the existence of world. <br><br>Jack got out and amazed by the outside world. He became attached to his\nGrandma, her friend and their dog. But his mother needed some time to\nadjust with all the changes.

She\nis the most deserving candidate, the emotion and attachment she showed\nfor her son was impressed.<br><br>The direction, story-lines and acting of all the casts is great, so is\nthe background music and cinematography.

{"review": "\nThe kidnapping, incarceration and rape of children is incredibly\ndifficult to represent authentically on screen. 'Michael' shows how\ndamning the effect can be when genre demands are prioritized over\nauthentic portrayals. The first half of Room offers up a subtly\nplausible account of how a young woman copes with appeasing her captor\nin order to avert his gaze from her son. The performances of Brie\nLarson and an outstanding Jacob Tremblay are crucial here. Jack craves\naffection but also explores revolt, and the parent-child bond is\nutterly convincing. Sean Bridgers as the captor Old Nick takes a\nbanality of evil approach: this could be your cousin, your neighbour,\nyour boss. When Jack escapes and Old Nick makes the decision to abandon\nhim in the street, the way he throws the boy down completely conveys\nthe psychopathic nature of the man. The second half of the film, about\nMa's difficulty in re-adjusting to society, works less well. Her father\nis wheeled in then wheeled off in order to make a point about the\ndifficulty of accepting his grandchild. The A-list casting here did not\nhelp - a more anonymous face in this role would have given it more of\nan everyday dark fear appeal.

Brie Larson gives the\nbets acting performance of this decade as Joy/Ma, a mother lost at sea,\nmetaphorically speaking. Jacob Tremblay gives a performance way beyond\nhis years. The Academy made a serious mistake not nominating him for an\naward. Joan Allen, in what little screen time she has, gives one of, if\nnot the most unappreciated performance of the year. Lenny Abrahmson has\nbeen quietly going about his business in Ireland. He certainly shocked\nmost people with this film. His talent is undeniable and the Academy\nAward nomination was just the reward he warranted. Emma Donoghue's\nnovel and script are both outstanding, and I believe that The Big Short\nwas lucky to win the Adapted Screenplay award. Stephen Rennicks is a\ncomplete unknown in the world of film composing. I feel this may\nchange. His work on this film is a revelation. The moment in this film\nwhere all the people named above are at their best is when Ma runs to\nthe police car in which Jack is waiting. The slow-motion running is\nastounding. The music is extremely moving. Brie Larson and Jacob\nTremblay are as good as they were for the rest of the film. I don't\nknow why I waited so long to see this film. I regret waiting to watch\nit and to anyone out there who wants to see the best film of 2015, or\nthe decade, I urge you to stop reading this and go watch it. You will\nbe better for it.\n"},
{"review": "\nBrie Larson gives an outstanding performance in this tale of a girl\nabducted, abused, impregnated, and what she had to overcome to keep her\nson alive. A young woman is abducted and then forced to live in a shed.\nThe shed is soundproof and locked. Her assailant then gets her pregnant\nand she has the baby. The story begins after the child is now about 5\nyears old. The mother and son live in this one room shed. The kidnapper\nonly shows up when he wants his way with the mother or brings food and\nsupplies. They are given just the bare minimum to survive. When the\nabductor starts to see the child as a possible new direction for the\nabuse, she knows it is time to get the child out before it is too late.\nThe script is well written. I believed every minute of what was going\non and how it played out. I hope not to give too much away, but getting\nout of the \"Room\" is only half the movie. The other half is filled with\ndeep emotional variances that take you across a broad spectrum of\nresponse to the situation.

{"review": "\n'ROOM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br><br>The critically acclaimed dramatic thriller flick; directed by Lenny\nAbrahamson and written by Emma Donoghue (based on her 2010 novel, of\nthe same name). The film is about a young mother, being held captive in\na locked single-room, with her 5-year-old son. The boy has never known\nlife, outside of the room; so his mother creates a complete alternate\nreality, inside the room for him. It stars Brie Larson and newcomer\nJacob Tremblay, as the kidnapped mother and son. It also costars Sean\nBridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. The film is predicted to be a\nlikely Oscar contender, come awards time, and it's received almost\nunanimously positive reviews, from critics. I liked it.<br><br>Jack (Tremblay) is five-years-old, and he's been locked in a single-\nroom, with his mother Joy (Larson), all of his life. He's never seen\nthe world, outside of the room, and his mother has taught him 'room' is\nall there is. We later learn that Joy was kidnapped when she was 17,\nand her captor impregnated her, with Jack, five-years earlier. As Joy\nbecomes even more desperate, to escape, she finally enlists Jack's\nhelp, in a dangerous plan. <br><br>The film is really dark and depressing, but there's also a slight bit\nof hope (in the darkness). Larson is fantastic in the lead, and\nTremblay is also amazing (especially for an actor so young). The movie\nis very moving, intense and heartbreaking; it's beautifully directed by\nAbrahamson, and brilliantly written by Donoghue. The film is basically\neverything you'd expect from a critical darling 'Oscar hopeful'.

All that I can say is that I hope to see both\nLarson and Tremblay in more movies, and I hope that Lenny Abrahamson\nturns out more movies like this one. Very good movie.<br><br>\"I'll see you all this comin' fall in the big rock candy mountain.\" -\nHarry McClintock\n"},
{"review": "\nThere are certain movies which leave you spellbound. Movies that make\nyou ponder upon the reality of life. Room falls into that category.<br><br>Frankly, I didn't hear of the movie till it was nominated for the\nOscars. I saw it after that and \"Wow\" was the word that I said. <br><br>So Room is the story of Joy, a girl who was kidnapped at the age of 17\nby a guy whom we just know as \"Old Nick\". During captivity she gets\npregnant and has a baby boy named Jack. So Joy has created this fairy\ntale world for Jack in the room they stay in and anything outside to\nthe room is just Outer space. So when Jack is 5, Joy thinks \"Enough is\nEnough\" and she needs to get out. How she plans to get out, forms the\npre-interval part of the movie and how Jack and Joy survive once they\nare released forms the latter half. <br><br>Bree Larson as Joy has given the performance that would literally give\nyou goosebumps. Her anguish, he jealousy, the disregard for the outside\nworld, each and every emotion is portrayed so brilliantly by Bree that\nyou eventually fall in love with her and empathize with her. <br><br>Jacob Tremblay as Jack is sheer perfection. Playing such a character at\nthis age is really tough and Jacob has just played it brilliantly. I\ncan not think of anyone else who would have played this character to\nthat perfection. <br><br>The story, the direction,cinematography everything is top-notch. Room,\nmakes you think, it makes you cry, it squishes your gut and you feel\neach and every emotion that Bree and Jack experience in the room. With\nlimited background score, Room relies on silence. It's a must watch for\nevery movie goer. I literally took a walk of 2kms after I saw the movie\nto just imbibe everything that I saw. Sheer Brilliance.\n"},
{"review": "\nA mother, Joy (played by Brie Larson), and her five-year old son, Jack\n(Jacob Tremblay), are held captive in a one-room shed. She was abducted\nby a stranger, Nick, and has been there for seven years. Jack was born\nthere and the room is his entire world. Then one day they escape and\nget to live normal lives. For Jack, the world he now is confronted by\nis a very foreign place.<br><br>A wonderful movie: highly original and incredibly emotional. Just the\ninitial plot - a mother and her son imprisoned for several years and\nhow they escape - was original enough but then we have the\npsychological and emotional implications of returning to society (or,\nin Jack's case, joining society for the first time), and this takes the\nplot to another plane. <br><br>Jack being confronted by and adapting to his new world is wonderfully\nand very sensitively told. His mother having to deal with all her\ndoubts regarding Jack adapting, and any residual guilt she feels from\ntheir time in captivity, is a great, and quite natural, story line too.<br><br>Great, emotional ending that perfectly ties up the movie.<br><br>Brie Larson got a Best Actress Oscar for her performance and deserved\nit. Jacob Tremblay, 8/9 years old at the time, is fantastic as Jack,\nshowing acting skills well beyond his age. Solid performances from a\nsupporting cast that includes Joan Allen and William H Macy.<br><br>My favourite movie of 2015.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen i started watching this film, for the first ten minutes i was not\nsure whether i can watch this film because of so many obvious things\nlike the level of cruelty and where this film might lead towards but as\nthis film entered into its fifteenth minute it gripped my brain\ncompletely and i understood what Brie and Jacob are doing here is not a\nperformance but it's simply magic. They both have captured maximum\nspace of the screen and they both have captured heart of millions. The\ndirectional eye is simply breath taking and the script - so simple yet\nvery powerful. A well deserved Oscar to Brie Larson. <br><br>I believe cinema like this makes this stage very important and\nappreciable. As a movie maker i must say this film is a milestone in\ncinematic achievements of all kind and i can simply congratulate each\nand everyone who were part of the cast &amp; crew of the team and those who\nhave already watched it. <br><br>For those who are planning to watch it - watch it now because its a\nperfect ten pointer for the genre of Drama.\n"},
{"review": "\n'Room\" takes you to a different world which is so innocently brought\nout by the child \"Jack\" who started thinking that everything out of the\nRoom is out of space and not real.The movie tries to connect with you\nand you always try to find reasons and meanings of lives of both the\ncharacters.For me the best part about the movie was not just when both\nthe characters finally got liberated,but it was how difficult it became\nfor them to connect with the real world after being liberated.The part\nthat drove me to write this review was the fact that the mother tried\nto commit suicide.And that really moved me and made me think.The movie\nreally does connect to you and even after movie gets over,it remains\nwith you.\n"},
{"review": "\nActually it's hard to rate this one as in most areas it is beyond\nexcellent but to be really critical you could pick holes in the plot.\nIn the end I've compromised at 9/10. I must admit I tried to avoid this\nmovie as I knew it would be a difficult watch, but ended up seeing it\nas someone else's choice on pay to view TV; I may have lost some of the\nimpact of \"being there\" that I would have got from the big screen. By\nnow thousands have reviewed the wonderful casting of and acting by the\ntwo leads and I concur completely. By five minutes in or less it's\nimpossible to imagine the roles being played by anyone else. And child\nactor Jacob Tremblay is just astonishing as Jack, who was born in\ncaptivity so knows nothing but the claustrophobic world of \"room\". This\nreally matters in the later stages when he has to cope with the wider\nworld and we are truly drawn into his struggle to adapt and understand.\nAs I always do, I have checked out one or two \"hated it\" reviews here\nand worry about some of those critics' ability to empathise, almost to\na psychopathic degree. To me, Joy's behaviour is 100% convincing. After\nso long in captivity and with her child to protect you would absolutely\nexpect her to have constructed a strategy for survival above all else,\neven if that means taking a submissive role with her captor. It's not\nlike it's just her own life that's on the line if she fights back and\nfails.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have seen some great dramas and this one rates good on my scale. I\nimagine the book is much better than the film because the story picks\nup in this one at the end of 7 years of being stuck living in one room.\nWhile references are made in slight bits about how the ordeal for Ma\nand Jack started, there is very little done to explain how this could\nhave happened for so long. Granted, that is not important to the\ndramatic part of this film, but it does make the film a leap that might\nexplain why -Old Nick when he does lose Jack just takes off. I really\nthought he might do something more desperate like go back and harm Ma\nbefore the police free her from the room. <br><br>When I looked at this, the hook is the relationship between Ma and her\nson Jack. Brie Larson as Ma &amp; Jacob Tremblay (Jack) are outstanding in\ntheir roles. Their relationship is key to this drama working. Ma's\nentire world is being kidnapped when she was 17, raped by old Nick\n(Sean Bridgers), having a son and then wrapping her entire life on\nbringing up her son in one room with Old Nick being the jailer and\nprovider for them both. It is an out of whack world which Jack can only\nsee through a skylight for 7 years. <br><br>Ma totally protects Jack from Old Nick like a mother in the wild\nprotects their young. She teaches him to read, and they do get exposure\nto the outside world via a television set. Finally, Ma uses her son to\nfinally escape from the room. Then this film goes into the raw emotions\nand reactions of shock as she and Jack get exposed to the outside\nworld.<br><br>Many times, Jack is narrating the story as it goes along. Jacob\nTremblay's performance is outstanding in all aspects here. Brie Larson\nis very good but it is the child's view which really carries this film\nto make the viewer care. It is the emotion which made me interested in\nthe film. It is not a perfect film, but it does pull the viewer in.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had no idea what this movie was about before I saw it, I just knew\nBrie Larson won an Oscar for it, and there were a lot of raves about\nthis movie so I decided to watch it. <br><br>Since I had no idea what it was about, I was pretty entertained for the\nfirst part of the movie. It had a couple of very intense minutes, but\nthen it got really boring. <br><br>I fell asleep in my couch, and that is saying a lot. I guess I'm not\nthe intended audience. <br><br>Not my kind of movie.<br><br>Also, I think it's more about the kid than the mother.\n"},
{"review": "\nEmma Donoghue adapted her popular novel ROOM for the screen so we are\nassured the concept it contains are the original ones from her story of\na kidnapped young girl sequestered in a shed, birthing a child by her\nabductor, and raising that child to accept his environs as real until\nthe two breakout of the shed and encounter the world.<br><br>Or as the company who created the film states, 'ROOM tells the\nextraordinary story of Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a spirited 5-year-old who\nis looked after by his loving and devoted mother Ma (Brie Larson). Like\nany good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe,\nnurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like\nplaying games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but\ntypical-- they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma\nhas euphemistically named Room. Ma has created a whole universe for\nJack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in\nthis treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and\nfulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows,\nand Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan\nto escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out\nto be the scariest thing yet: the real world.<br><br>The star of the film is Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson does a credible\nturn as Ma and the 'outsiders' \u0096 Ma's parents Joan Allen, William H.\nMacy and her kidnapper Sean Bridges \u0096 carry their weight. The film is\nunnecessarily long and that need for editing diminishes the\nextraordinary impact of Jack as he discovers the real world. If young\nCanadian actor Jacob Tremblay secures the right agent he could become a\nvery important actor in the future. The story concept is excellent and\ncarries many messages to which we should all pay heed.\n"},

{"review": "\nTo start up, I honestly haven't seen such a good movie as this one for\na longer time. It is so emotional and heartbreaking watching those two,\nfirstly in Room, then in the real world as well. I found interesting\nrealizing the oscillations in getting used to the whole massive change\nbetween a grownup and a child. Freedom is relative, this movie proves\nit. So is space and boundaries. If you don't know what's on the other\nside of the wall and don't even know the other side even exists, you\nfeel safe. You don't doubt your freedom at all. Jack felt like\neverything is happening with a reason, just the way it should be. His\nimagination made him believe that. It was also quite interesting\nwatching how Jack's thoughts broadened up as time was passing by. I was\nsurprised how well he adapted to new surroundings, unlike his poor\nmother.

{"review": "\nA woman and her child are locked in a room. The child is a boy, though\nhis distracting long hair and feminine features suggest otherwise, and\nthe room is his entire world.

Although the movie works on an emotional level without feeling\ntoo manipulative, I disliked the scenario and was bothered by the\nquestions it raised. How believable is the main characters' captivity,\nthe extent of their trauma, and their attempts to escape it? I have my\ndoubts, but I think the audience is supposed to be too in awe of their\nmaternal bond to care. I, however, wanted a little more intelligence\nfrom the tantrum-prone duo. The mother is saved by a five-year-old with\na facile understanding of his environment. Ignorance is bliss, I\nsuppose, but let's not pretend it's lovely or enlightening.

{"review": "\nThe crime of kidnapping and extended captivity is well known through\nmedia exposure that sensationalises the psychological horrors of\nconfinement in claustrophobic spaces. The dependency of some victims on\nan abusive captor or prison is just one of the many strange twists\nfound in captivity stories. But this one is different because it is\nnarrated through the eyes of five- year old Jack who was born in a\nfortified shed with only a small overhead skylight visually connected\nto what is outside his world called Room. His mother was abducted at\nseventeen and has been a captive for seven years, raising Jack as best\nshe can in a co-dependent relationship that shines beautifully in their\nsmall prison. When tormentor Nick loses his job she knows he will not\nkeep them alive, and that's when the slow-paced narrative opens\npredictably towards a fast world full of frighteningly wonderful sights\nand sounds and feelings expressed through the naivety of a newborn\nfive-year old.<br><br>This film would not work without the emotionally intelligent acting of\nJacob Tremblay as Jack. Being almost ten and convincingly presenting as\nhalf his age is nothing short of remarkable. He describes his new world\nthrough wide eyes and lyrical words that capture the exploding space\ninto which he is thrust, and he alone holds this film together. As Ma,\nBrie Larson's acting fixates on maternal dynamics at the cost of a\nconvincing portrayal of captivity trauma. The scene where Jack and Ma\nre-visit Room after Nick is caught has all the nonchalance of strolling\nthrough a museum, as the story winds down from the highs of a taut\npsychological thriller to a modest melodrama. It is after all a film\nthat strives for insight, not entertainment, while remaining true to\nthe book upon which it is based. It does this thoughtfully in the first\nhalf, but slowly loses focus as it drifts aimlessly towards the end.\n"}
