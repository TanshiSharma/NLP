{"review": "\nThe film is not bad based on its technical merits. The lighting,\neffects, and acting are all fine and actually Johansson is fabulous in\nthe first part of the film. <br><br>What makes this movie so terrible is that it's attempting to make a\nsophisticated statement, but it can't even keep its own logic straight.\nThere is no conflict; Lucy is so powerful and devoid of empathy that\nthe film devolves into total nihilism. She just gun battles and goes on\ncar chases because she has only 24 hours to download her brain for the\nsake of... who knows? Humanity? So let's rush, because without that all\nis lost for... humanity? But Lucy doesn't give an f* about anyone else.<br><br>What does a person beyond human logic act like? Since that's\nimpossible, I don't know, and apparently the director doesn't either.\nWhy does using more of her brain make her lose all capacity for empathy\nor social logic? Don't know. <br><br>It feels like the whole thing is just for the sake of itself. Her\npowers and their progression are just not believable. Scene after scene\nof gun violence without any moral lesson or conflict gets very boring.<br><br>This movie could have made some sort of intelligent comment on human\nmorality, the origins and purpose of empathy.... nope, instead it makes\nthe comment that gun battles are cool.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you're expecting a character driven storyline or you're someone that\nis unable to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours then this movie\nprobably won't be for you.<br><br>The storyline is nothing new and has been explored quite a few times,\nit's basically the concept of are we more or can we be more than what\nwe are.<br><br>Whilst they used an idea about the brain that has long since been\nproved nothing more than a myth it works to drive the concept of the\nfilm. I do think with a little thought they could of made this a little\nbit more believable though if they had just focused on being able to\nuse more of the brains potential rather than \"capacity\".<br><br>Anyway apart from the basic concept that we still do not really\nunderstand our brains and what they are capable of everything else in\nthe movie is based a lot in the realm of fantasy. There was a whole lot\nof things in the movie that could of been done better but even with all\nthose flaws I still found it entertaining.<br><br>The only thing that let the film down for me was the ending which even\nthough visually was probably the best part of the film it still felt a\nlittle too generic and overdone.<br><br>There seems to be a lot of reviews on here that bang on about realism\nand it being unbelievable etc but if you are going to rate a film on\nthat then recent films like Transformers and all the super hero movies\nshould be rated a 1 because hey a school student getting bitten by a\nradioactive spider or super sized robots trying to overtake earth is\nfar more believable...<br><br>This film is a fantasy sci-fi with great visuals and while not\n\"realistic\" or perfectly executed has a thought provoking concept.\n"},
{"review": "\nDisappointing movie towards the end. Starts off well, everything makes\nsense, everything is clever, logical and interesting. After a certain\npoint in the movie everything becomes ridiculous, unrealistic and not\nenjoyable to watch. The idea behind the movie was good, execution was\nnot. The characters were also a little bit boring in my opinion. The\nsituation the main character found herself in had an array of\nextraordinary things to do and take advantage of but didn't. Not a lot\nout of the ordinary happened, main character worrying throughout and\nnot taking advantage/playing around with the situation she was in.

{"review": "\nI think bad reviews come mostly from people who want to show other how\ngood their science is. Fair enough, this film starts from the premise\nthat humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this\nbarrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. This leitmotiv\nwas quite smartly picked to raise interest,although scientifically\ninaccurate. However this film excites the mind of those who REALLY know\nphysics and know how few limits there are in what we can achieve in\npushing our evolution through science to become indistinguishable from\nmagic. \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from\nmagic.\" I personally enjoyed every bit of the movie and, as it took me\nto a journey into the far far future, where humans can overcome their\nhumanity and become real Gods.<br><br>Enjoy this film and let your mind explore the impossible.\n"},

{"review": "\nNormally I don't write reviews but these movie differed so much from\nwhat people told me I fell compelled to give my opinion.

However, I got\nan extremely interesting, unusual and highly entertaining story, that I\nfound quite fascinating. Of course, it's completely unrealistically,\nbut the whole idea is quite funny and unusual. I generally like movies\nwhich manage to introduce new ideas or differ from the same old boring\npatterns (Iron Man 12, Final Destination 14, Transformers 8). Lucy does\nthat. Its just, well, cool.

{"review": "\nLucy is a spectacularly ridiculous but very entertaining film which is\nthe best one Luc Besson has directed in a long time... even though,\nconsidering all the missteps he has had since he returned from\n\"retirement\" 9 years ago, that isn't a big compliment. For better or\nfor worse, Lucy employs Besson's habitual style, combining abundant\naction, a creative visual style and an accelerated rhythm which, in\nthis case, distract us from the parade of nonsense and inconsistencies\nfrom the screenplay (Hasn't the \"we only use 10% of our brain\" myth\nalready been discarded?). Fortunately, this film counts with solid\nperformances from the whole cast, starting by Scarlett Johansson, who\nbrings charisma and credibility. Morgan Freeman brings his usual\nconviction, serene presence and persuasive voice, while Choi Min-sik\nand Nicolas Phongpheth bring quite a personality to their villain\nroles. Besides, with only 89 minutes of running time, Lucy ends as\nquickly as it began, it never gets boring at all and it leaves us with\nsome philosophical reflections I found interesting. Lucy is not a great\nfilm, but it entertained me very much, and I recommend it as a pleasant\ndistraction which doesn't require us to pay too much attention.

So here goes. Many of\nthe references will only be caught by sci-fi fans over the age of 30\nwho also paid strict attention while in high school or college. That's\nnot a jab at anyone's intelligence. There are simply not many people\nwho find quantum theory exciting. The movie attempts to give a\nvisualization to this not-so-well understood school of thought.\nCombining fiction along with real science is not easy to do while\nkeeping it entertaining at the same time. An example reference is with\nthe oversized USB flash drive shown at the end. Did anyone else notice\nit was \"full of stars\"? Not glitter...stars. Yep, that's a 2001/2010 A\nSpace Odyssey monolith reference. The shape of the drive along with the\nstars was a dead giveaway. Whenever a monolith appears in 2001 it is\nalways followed by a major evolutionary jump. What was Lucy\nexperiencing? An evolution of consciousness. What was Lucy seeing\nduring her armchair travel through time? If you also said \"evolution\"\nthen you are correct. She saw the evolution of life on earth as well as\nthe evolution of time and the entire universe itself. Lucy went a step\nfurther than 2001/10 in that it shows the interconnections with ALL\nthings at the quantum level and beyond.

The main\nproblem with these kinds of references is that they usually don't\ntranslate very well when shown on the screen.

That's why I thought the introduction of the time element -\n'Time is the only unit of measure' - was a compelling one.<br><br>As far as the story goes, some of it's logic falls apart at the finale\nas far as that gun battle between the authorities and the Korean\ngangsters. It was already established that Lucy could control the\nbehavior of others in earlier scenes, so there was no need for all that\ncarnage except to satisfy the gore and violence fans.

Instead, he gets little screen time and Lucy becomes the\nstar.

However, one has to appreciate the special effects, how\nseeing different forms of the magnetic spectrum, and possibilities of\ncontrolling one's own body, come into play. The movie is not\npretentious in this regard, nor does it act arrogant and say 'yes, this\nis what will happen'. It was pure fluke that this character experiences\nwhat she does, and she uses it for the better of mankind with a twist\nthat isn't unexpected.

First off, Scarlett\nJohansson is awesome in the movie. It's almost what would be expected\nif the Black Widow from the \"Avengers\" went through the Captain America\nprocess then went after HYDRA. Unfortunately, in \"Lucy,\" HYDRA is\nreplaced by the Chinese mafia, and the Super Soldier Serum is replaced\nby a dangerous addictive drug which in small doses causes heightened\nintelligence. Small doses is the key because when Scarlett's character\nis unwittingly used as a drug mule, the drugs break open in large doses\ninside her, granting her heightened intelligence, psychokinetic powers,\nparanormal abilities and eventually a complete control over reality\nitself. Along the way, Morgan Freeman narrates what's happening as the\nexpert on this drug who she seeks out for help.

{"review": "\nIn my view this is the best film Besson has directed since 1997's The\nFifth Element. The film in certain ways is a lot like Limitless, but at\nthe same time it takes a very different overall approach and look on\nthe subject of human evolution. I'm sure that many people will not care\nmuch for this film since it is filled with a lot of mystical/spiritual\nreferences and ideas and even some false science, however those with an\nopen mind and an active imagination will likely be very glad they saw\nthe film. This is clearly a work of fiction people, but there is no one\nsaying you can't relate fiction to reality either, and actually learn\nsomething from it once in a while too. Our limitless imaginations are\npart of what makes human beings so extraordinary, we are best off using\nthis gift and appreciating it. Fictional films can still be very\nthought provoking, and this one definitely fits that category. 2001: A\nSpace Odyssey isn't scientifically accurate in many ways to our current\nknowledge, but it's still a monster landmark of a film nonetheless.\nLucy is certainly not 2001, however they both ride that same\nimagination rules line that can spark the internal fires of unique\ncreative thinking. In my view Lucy is a sci-fi trip worth taking.\n7.5/10\n"},
{"review": "\nLucy is a Bourne Identity meets Kill Bill meets Limitless romp auteured\nby Luc Besson, the man behind classics like Leon the Professional and\nLa Femme Nikita. In one of the stranger wide releases in years, there\nis much reward given to those willing to give Lucy grace (ridiculous\npremise and over-the-top aspirations). It's flawed, but it's a brightly\nfilmed and darkly themed scifi action thriller that delivers. Lucy\nposits the debatable notion that humans only use 10% brain capacity.\nJohansson plays the title character that goes from monotony to\nsuperhero when a new drug gives her the ability to use 100% of her\nbrains power. Her capabilities aren't just big math problems and fast\nreading, but telekinesis, shape shifting and other comic-booky things.\nIt's a fascinating if overly ambitious premise that Besson puts to\ngreat use, playing it out like a briskly paced, inventive TV pilot. The\nscifi is strong, with theories and declarations posited throughout and\nthematic exposition that works. The shining element here is Johansson,\nwho continues her upward trajectory in a bombastic yet effective\nperformance. Her progression from a nobody to the most powerful femme\nfatale in history is emotional, funny and relatively believable. It's\ngreat to see Besson bounce back after The Family to present what may be\nhis magnum opus, touching on all of time and creation in under 90\nminutes. Sure, some of the effects are cheap and goofy, but the editing\nis unique and tight, the violence and style are lively, and the\nstorytelling is refreshing. Engaging and cool, Lucy is highly stylized\nscifi pulp of the highest order.\n"},
