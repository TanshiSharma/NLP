{"review": "\nAntoine Fuqua's and Denzel Washington's paths collide once more as they\ncome together to create a stylish and daring action thriller about a\nman with a mysterious past, whose quiet life suddenly turns into a rip-\nroaring adventure of guns and thrills. Both Denzel Washington and Chloe\nGrace Moretz give stellar performances and display perfect chemistry as\ntwo friends stuck in a world of crime and violence. Arguably Fuqua's\nbest film since 'Training Day', 'The Equalizer' is a brutal and\nmerciless tale that explores the Russian underworld on the East Coast\nand the corruption ties within the law enforcement of Boston's police\ndepartment.\n"},
{"review": "\nJust when I thought Hollywood couldn't go lower, comes this\nmasterpiece. I'm sad to see Washington agreeing to play this role which\nis way below his standard. I guess Uncle Sam payed him hefty dollars to\ntake part in this political message to Russia. Long story short, Denzel\n(Obama) single-handedly, and with use of some home appliances, kills\nthe entire Russian mob organisation including the boss in Russia,\nVladimir Pushkin (Putin). He even blows up the gas pipeline\n(seriously?) The prostitutes represent Ukraine, that needs protection\nfrom big bad Russians. Uninventive, childish, crude, terribly written\npolitical propaganda. Avoid if you can.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie was action packed and I love when the good guy always win.\nThe character don't talk much but you can only pull that off if you are\na good actor. The young actress I hear she is 17 did an amazing job to\nplay that part.Denzel no words you still got the box office power. My\nhusband ex marine he would not stop hollering when one scene came up he\ngets a kick out of that stuff. Never seen the Equalizer series at all\nso my opinion is from the movie only. Sequel is wide open lets have\nmore next year. Hope to see more. Love It. Hope the DVD be out for a\nChristmas Present for the husband I will be buying it. All I can say is\ngo see this movie because it is very good don't listen to the haters.\n"},
{"review": "\nFairly solid action scenes, characters and overall execution. Somehow\nthe filmmakers and actors make this very hard to believe film\nenjoyable. This is definitely a sensationalistic film(The most\nsensationalistic of Washington's career without a doubt.), and it's\nmostly a regurgitated cookie cutter crowd pleaser of violent vengeance\nas well, but it does manage to remain quite an entertaining action film\nat the same time. Even though it has a running time of over two hours,\nthe film does feel overall as though it is missing a few key scenes,\nbut nonetheless it's still worth a look if you're into these kinds of\nfilms. The movie didn't remind me much at all of the old T.V. series of\nthe same name. The film is much more reminiscent of some of the old\nbrutally violent morality tales that Charles Broson use to do. All that\nsaid, this basically chalks up as a good film to watch when you don't\nwant to think much, and you just want to watch a lot of kick ass\nentertaining violence. It's that kind of guilty pleasure. 6.5/10\n"},
{"review": "\nIf it was not a Denzel Washington movie; it could easily pass for \"B\"\ndirect to video movie. Low production values; not outstanding\ncharacters or actors (aside from Denzel and little used Cloe Moretz), a\nquite predictable and lazy written story, several \"USA POLITICALLY\nCORRECT DETAILS\" **spoiler follow** Denzel never kills a cop **end of\nspoiler** This is a movie Denzel can do it while sleeps and he is\nreally good; but it is not a good movie by far. Too long for his own\ngood and cheap special effects, uninteresting final showdown. Antoine\nFuqua made the mid budget \"Olympus Has Fallen\" last year and the looked\nfar more expensive that this one (which reportedly cost over 50M) In\nbrief; if you are a fan of Denzel; get \"Training Day\"; this one is not\nworth the over two hours spent.\n"},

The final was crushing - Denzel\ngoes to Moscow and kills the bad guy in his bathroom, preliminary\nliquidating his army of bodyguards. The message - Russians, don't mess\nwith us or we shall send you our deadliest weapon - DIY supervisor. We\nhave a new sheriff in town - killing the bad, protecting the poor Latin\nminority, punishing the corrupted cops... Hollywood best days were over\nlong time ago. RIP!

{"review": "\nI like a good 'underdog triumphs over adversity' movie but we have been\nhere before with Denzil (Man On Fire!) who I previously much respected\nfor his earlier works. If you have seen any film in the genre you have\nalready seen this which offers nothing original. Seems like Denzil had\na spare couple of months and million (also producer credit) and thought\nhis name could carry this predictable rehash of Edward Woodward's\noriginal, much more believable brand. As expected, DW is a great actor\nbut he should be ashamed of this carbon copy as should those who voted\nto bring this to an IMDb 7. I am losing faith in this scoring. I know\npeople liked this but I guess expectations are currently low.\n"},
{"review": "\nI actually smelled the odor of a piece of \"riiiiiight\" cinema pretty\nearly on, and decided to stop watching. A \"riiiight\" film, for those\nwho don't know because I just made it up, is where the filmmaker tries\nto make you believe something so unrealistic and far fetched that you\nsay to yourself (or maybe even say out loud): \"riiiiiight, possibly\nfollowed by \"suuuuuuuuuuure\".<br><br>The boredom of a 10 hr flight got to me in the end, and I decided to\nturn it back on. Many \"riiiiight\"s later I got to the end. I often get\npeople telling me that they like these movies even though they know\nthey are far fetched because they are \"just entertainment\". But when\neverything is so overdone that it looks like a satire but it really\nisn't, I check out. This was such a film. In spite of maybe murdering\n50 villains during the movie, Denzel is the good guy, and we are\nsupposed to feel sympathy for him. And the Russian bad guys were so, so\nbad. Thank god Denzel is there to slaughter them all with no collateral\ndamage. He's such a bad ass.\n"},

Anyone praising this film is either under 15 years old or\ncompletely out of his mind.

{"review": "\nTo be honest, Denzel Washington showed off a brilliant performance and\nhis character is pretty good.

There were many scenes throughout that simply\ndidn't make much sense which took away the film's entertainment.<br><br>The action scenes were not terrible but I believe they could have been\ndone much better. The main character (Denzel Washington) fights off\nsome of the Russian gangsters near the beginning and the fight looked\nrather unrealistic, especially when he drives that corkscrew through\nthe guy's jaw.

{"review": "\nDenzel Washington gives a solid performance as always, but the\nEqualizer is of the same quality as many other Denzel led thrillers:\nwithout him it would not be meaningful, with him it's watchable &amp;\nspecial.

The conflicts are generally well written and ratchet pressure\nnicely, especially when Denzel has some chilly conversations with his\nsoon-to-be-victims before they inevitably make their bad decisions. The\ntense sit-downs were equally entertaining for me just as the bloody\nviolence. Director Antoine Fuqua goes about his business in a more than\ncompetent manner; the technical qualities are above average, though the\nfilm has moments where it seems too infatuated with its slick sense of\nstyle. The Equalizer is an exciting, high-adrenaline thriller.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was actually better than I expected. It was kind of a mix of\nbond/bourne type ingenuity action with an added modern day superhero\nquality - the type that allows the viewer to get a bit carried away\nwith all the action without questioning how believable the story line\nis. For me it has some great high adrenaline action and at the centre\nof it all is the ever cool Denzel Washington. The story line tends to\ndelve further into the unbelievable the further it goes on - eventually\nto the point where you wonder how Mr Mccall could so easily seemingly\nreturn to his normal everyday life after such outrageous public\nexposure. But then you remember that it's all about unapologetic action\n- and doesn't try to be particularly believable or convey any deep and\nmeaningful message.

In that respect I\nwas hoping for Timothy Dalton. Regardless this film is as I said\nneither great nor horrible.
