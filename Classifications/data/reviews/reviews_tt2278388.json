{"review": "\nWes Anderson is one of the most original film makers working today.\nNone of his films can be categorized into any particular genre. His\nlatest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, which opened the Berlin Film\nFestival, continues that trend. It is a tale within a tale within\nanother tale. Whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged as\nthough a work of Art hanging in a museum, story wise Anderson has let\nhis imagination run wild. Though the tale (with Tom Wilkinson as the\nauthor of the story) and the tale within the tale (with Jude Law as the\nyoung author &amp; F Murray Abraham as the mysterious owner of THe Grand\nBudapest Hotel) have straightforward narratives, the tale within the\ntale within the tale, which comprises the bulk of the film and is set\nin the years preceding the Second World War, is a wild uproarious train\nride of story telling. It also boasts the cast of a life time: Ralph\nFiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe,\nHarvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson &amp; countless\ncameos. It will delight Anderson fans but is more likely destined for\nArt house cinemas as it is too off center for mainstream audiences. The\nproduction design and music are outstanding and even the end credits\nare imaginatively done (and received another ovation from the\naudience).\n"},
{"review": "\nWes Anderson is one of the last directors -auteurs- who's got complete\ncontrol on the film set and has the power to make whatever kind of film\nhe desires. His distinct visual style is apparent since his 1996 debut\nBottle Rcoket. But that was just a start, with every film he made he\nwas perfecting his technique more and more. This marvelous attention to\ndetail, the way he composes his shots( tracking shots, the symmetry,\nthe characters running in slow-motion), chase scenes, love story,\nnostalgia, explanatory montages, the colourful set design and the\nprevalent theme of every one of his films: family. This all adds up to\nthe reason why the audience enjoys Anderson's film so much. This all is\nbrought to perfection in Grandhotel Budapest. <br><br>Through complex narrative framework, which itself is a mockery of all\nthese films that are being narrated by someone and is also being an\nexcuse for not being too realistic, we get to a story of a young lobby\nboy named Zero Moustafa and Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes)the concierge of\nthe Grandhotel Budapest. Many of the female guests of the hotel mainly\ncome to enjoy Gustave's company. When one of these ladies passes away,\nGustave grabs Zero and boards a train for her mansion. Soon he's blamed\nfor her murder and hunted by police led by Edward Norton and a\ngrim-faced assassin played by Willem Dafoe. There also is a love story\nbetween two young teens - Zero and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who has a\nbirthmark in the shape of Mexico.<br><br>I frankly don't understand how can this film be successful in the USA.\nThis film is just so typically European, that I guess some aspects of\nthe film Americans just aren't familiar with. Some of the humor\nreminded of old French, Italian and Czech comedies. <br><br>Wes Anderson remains to be a stand-out filmmaker who never disappoints\nwith any of his creations and is a safe bet to rely on his qualities.\nYou won't want to return to the real world when the credits start to\nroll.\n"},
{"review": "\nAfter seeing the previews several times, I thought I would enjoy a\ndelightful almost-fantasy-like film. But, at age 64, after going to the\nmovies literally hundreds of times in my lifetime, I did something\ntoday that I've only ever done 3 times previously -- I walked out of a\nmovie halfway through the picture. I didn't blame Wes Anderson, because\nclearly his films have a following...but I thought it must be an\nacquired taste...that I had not acquired. I admitted that it was a\nuniquely visually pleasing film, but I wondered why so many fine actors\nagreed to what were rather small parts. At the time I said that this\nfilm bored me even more than \"Moonrise Kingdom\". <br><br>The the other night it was on cable. I thought I would give it another\ntry, but I fully expected to turn it off at home, also. Perhaps it\nhelped that rather than watch it all in one setting, I broke it into\nroughly 30 minute segments with breaks in between. Guess what. This\ntime I liked it. I'm not saying I loved it. But I did like it. What did\nI see this time that I didn't see before. Well, perhaps the\ntongue-in-cheek attitude of the film. The chance to see Ralph Finnes be\ndownright silly instead of his typical dramatic role. The wonderful\nphotography and special effects. The skill of young actor Tony\nRevolori. The pleasure of seeing F. Murray Abraham again. And, this\ntime enjoying the many \"cameo\" shots.<br><br>I still think it dragged on a bit too long (at 100 minutes there are\nstill a few small bits that could have been edited more tightly or even\neliminated).

{"review": "\nAn extraordinary cinematic confection and probably Wes Anderson's\ngreatest film. Ralph Fiennes plays the concierge at the Grand Budapest\nHotel in the 1930s, which exists in a fictional European country in the\nAlpine range. He has a habit of keeping some of the old women who stay\nat the hotel company. When one (Tilda Swinton) leaves him the valuable\npainting Boy with Apple, Swinton's evil son (Adrien Brody) frames\nFiennes for the murder. Fiennes' closest companion, the hotel lobby boy\nZero (Tony Revolori), and his girlfriend (Saorsie Ronan) conspire to\nfree Fiennes from prison and sell the painting for loads of money,\nhopefully enabling them to leave the country, which is being overtaken\nby fascists. The story isn't much more than fluff (though there is a\nnice tinge of poignancy), but it's enormously amusing fluff. The highly\namusing trailer did give away many of the film's best gags, but this is\na laugh a minute movie. The visuals are absolutely delightful. Sure,\nit's all nothing you haven't seen before from Anderson, but I found it\nhis most perfect accomplishment. The film is loaded with great cameos\nand little roles (the woman behind me almost had an orgasm when Bill\nMurray appeared), but my favorite was Willem Dafoe as a toothless\nheavy.\n"},
{"review": "\nInteresting sets, beautifully locations, wooden characters. Too much of\nthe story takes places in trains, a prison and the countryside.

That may also be its\nproblem. As interesting as the film would seem to be theoretically, it\nseems as hollow and superficial as a picture postcard.

There were\nwhole scenes that were amateurishly animated. Many lines that I think\nwere supposed to be shocking just came off dumb. Having funny stuff\ngoing on in the background can be a great device when used with skill,\nsuch as in Police Squad or even Mad Magazine, but then the background\nstuff has to actually be funny.

It\nreminded me of \"The Big Lebowski\" and \"Adaptation,\" which have their\nown cult following.<br><br>The movie does rely on a superb cast of actors that won't disappoint\nany moviegoer; but the problem with the movie is the story itself. In a\nunique way, it rehashes old themes of greed, intolerance, and obsession\nwith the material world. It helps perpetuate the notion that humanity\nis flawed and that life has no ultimate purpose. It seems to reinforce\nthose sensibilities generated or amplified explicitly and implicitly by\nindividualistic life choices and humanistic thoughts within the\nconfines of the human experience.<br><br>Artistically, it lacks the complete range of human emotions necessary\nfor a wholesome movie.

Yes the\nperformances, especially Ralph Fiennes, are top notch. This is a decent\nmovie, but decent is where it stops. It doesn't have anything to\nseparate itself from previous quirky and dark humor filled films that\nWes Anderson has released, it doesn't have the heart from Moonrise\nKingdom, the charisma of The Fantastic Mr. Fox, or the mystique from\nThe Darjeeling Limited. Yes, every director may have their own styles\nand tweak it differently for each of their works, but Wes Anderson only\nadds some minor plot differences to his films to make them slightly\n\"different,\" yet still far too similar. I have been fine with them in\nthe past, but by The Grand Budapest Hotel, his fourth main entry, the\ngoofy style becomes a little tedious and actually difficult to get\nthrough in some scenes. Many trivial things are presented as important\nmatter in drawn out sequences, making it all the more difficult to\nwatch. Yes, I am harshly bad mouthing this movie, but I did still find\nsome enjoyment in watching the gorgeous film making and the once in\nwhile funny script, but come the third act, all the twists just become\nmuch too predictable, and ultimately unsatisfying.

Firstly the drop dead gorgeous cinematography, which\nis so stylish and clever that it almost becomes a character in its own\nright. The angles used perfectly to emphasis the emotions of the\ncharacters and give personality to the settings (most notably the hotel\nitself).This along with the lavish set design and stunning scenery are\nundoubtedly the film's greatest strength and are amongst the greatest\nexamples of the craft I have ever seen. If the Oscar's fail to\nrecognise these achievements, I shall be horribly disappointed. <br><br>The performances and writing are also great. Ralph Fiennes steals the\nshow with his hilarious, detailed and unique performance in the lead\nrole. Adrein Brody, Tony Revolori, Willem Dafoe and Saoirse Ronan also\ndeserve praise for their enjoyable and distinct efforts in the films\nglorious ensemble cast. All the characters are written beautifully and\nhighly entertainingly, with Anderson injecting his style without\nallowing it to overwhelm the film or consume the characters.<br><br>Finally, I appreciate the film's sharp pacing and tone. It keeps things\nbrisk, light and energetic (I'm amazed so much was squeezed into 90\nmins so effortlessly), however still for slow moments of character and\natmosphere. The film also balances darker character moments and the use\nof the film's primary framing device is integral to it's almost\ndreamlike atmosphere.<br><br>In conclusion, Wes Anderson has won me over with his masterful work. I\nguess you could call me a fan now after all.\n"},
{"review": "\nMost films that are released now are either cheap comedy films, clich\u00e9\naction films or superhero movies. Apart from some exceptions. The Grand\nBudapest Hotel is one of those exceptions. With the perfect blend of\ndark humour, a brilliant storyline and fabulous directing this\ncertainly is Wes Anderson's best film yet. Anderson's films are\ndefinitely stylised to say the least and not all people like his style\nof still shots with a vintage look and feel. Personally I love it, he\nis one of this generations best directors. That man is an artist. You\ncan tell the amount of effort from, not just Wes but the cast as well,\nthat went into every shot to make it as good as it can be. The\nsoundtrack matches perfectly to the film and the humour is\nlaugh-out-loud funny. The Grand Budapest Hotel is now one of my all\ntime favourite films and I am proud to say so.

It is an original work of art\nthat uses humor to convey the realities of human behavior, including\ngreed, lust, love, brutality and the idea that life, in the end, can be\nwhat we make it. Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien\nBrody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen\nWilson and others will keep you entertained while Anderson spins this\nhistorical fairy tale.

None the\nless,this picture is such a treat. Similar to Agatha's 'Courtesan au\nChocolat',it is a beautifully decorated piece of perfection,hiding a\nchocolate surprise on the inside,and packed in a pretty pink box with a\nsignature blue ribbon. A few things come to mind with such a grand\nslice of cinematography; the guests(ranging from somewhat sane to\ncompletely cuckoo),Mr. Gustave's polished black shoes,and of course -\npink. Pastel pink everywhere. I also take a liking to the hints of\nawkwardness that arise,as well as the tension in the air between the\ncharacters,so thick you could cut it with a butter knife. Or\nperhaps,the 'Throat Slitter'... It is clear,from the very beginning of\nthe movie,that everything had to be done perfectly,or the magic of this\ndivine hotel would be lost.

The Grand Budapest Hotel embarks on what is supposed to\nbe a surreal, violent, grotesque, mythopoeic, symbol-laden, allegorical\njourney to spiritual enlightenment. Even taken as a series of\nallegorical parables, the experiment is a failure. The imagery is\nrarely interesting, and the symbolism manages to be at once\nheavy-handed and empty of real meaning.

Various\nreviewers have described it as masturbatory, which is accurate.<br><br>The truly great surrealist artists reject conventions as a choice, but\nare capable of folowing them: Breton could render a realistic portrait\nof quality. Many who style themselves as surrealists are people who\nproduce chaotic and shoddy works because they aren't capable of\nanything else.

It just doesn't carry the comic weight of Bill\nMurray's ship the Belafonte in Life Aquatic because there is no Calypso\nto measure it against. For those of you who don't know, Calypso was\nCousteau's real-world research vessel.

They all together shape up this well made set piece that\nis mostly confined to the setting of the Hotel. The acting by Ralph\nFiennes is a treat and Tony Revolori as the lobby boy is a revelation. <br><br>The interesting part of the film I found was the use of varied aspect\nratio. It differentiates the time frames intelligently. Wes Anderson is\na director who oozes out fun in his films. His films are more about fun\nand the camaraderie between the characters. The shots are slick, the\nart direction is generally awesome and the cinematography is superb.\nThe film is very appealing visually and all his films thus far have\nbeen stylish. <br><br>There is enough substance in this fun story There is action, chase,\nfight, enough drama and even suspense. It's all well stitched and made\nthe whole film an engaging experience. Of course, the script is the\nhero followed by superb art direction of the hotel.<br><br>I am not sure, if this was shot on location or whether they erected a\nset, but it was just beautiful. The hotel, interiors, the painting of\nthe exteriors and even the locales. <br><br>This film shall be a 4/5 for the acting and the art direction alone.\nThanks to Wes Anderson for giving us a good time at the movies yet\nagain.\n"},
{"review": "\nWes Anderson produces another charming adventure in The Grand Budapest\nHotel that is full of interesting characters.<br><br>We embark on a splendid adventure within The Grand Budapest Hotel told\nby Mr. Zero Moustafa, the one time lobby-boy and now lofty owner of the\nestablishment. We travel back in time to the 1930's at the hotel's peak\nof grandiosity to meet the beguiling M. Gustave, Zero's one time\npredecessor and mentor. A battle of fortune and theft sets forward a\nmonumental ordeal involving an insurmountable many.<br><br>M. Gustave is a meticulous man with a taste for the finest comforts in\nlife. Ralph Fiennes plays the bourgeois concierge completely straight\nand, yet, is the source of most laughs in this comedy and is wonderful\nto watch. The rest of the film is a who's who of well-known actors in\nfully realized idiosyncratic character performances. Expect to see\nEdward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton,\nAdrien Brody, among others we've grown accustomed in a Wes Anderson\nfilm, though I won't ruin the surprise.<br><br>When you look at the film in parts it is masterful. The visuals and\nsets are luxuriously stunning, beyond anything you could imagine and a\ndream. The acting is top notch and characters intriguing. The story is\nentertaining and funny and especially unique. The music by Alexandre\nDesplat is charming and complementary. And yet, I feel as though the\nfilm doesn't come together as Mr. Anderson wished.<br><br>Wes Anderson films tend to be rife with characters and plot lines. The\nGrand Budapest Hotel jumps from each strand without fully completing or\nconnecting at its conclusion, especially in regard to minor characters.<br><br>While thoroughly enjoyable and charming as a film, if more time were\ntaken to develop some subplots, remove others, and intertwine the rest,\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel would easily have been one of Wes Anderson's\nfinest creations.<br><br>More reviews of films new and old can be found at our website!\n"},
{"review": "\nI do not see any drama worthy of praise in this film I'm not a writer\nor a film critic, but I am viewer and me the right question is it worth\nthis film to enter the Oscars? The only thing worth praising the film\nis the soundtrack,<br><br>but photography is very bad and some of the scenes by a stationary,\nstable images do not move where realism in this?

{"review": "\nThere have been several reviews panning this excellent film and I think\nI know the problem - people are not truly watching and experiencing\nthis movie. It's an odd-ball sort of movie - def' a little quirky - but\nthe key is to just open your mind and watch and not \"expect\" anything.\nLet things come to you as the director sends them. You must pay\nattention because the images and the dialog come quickly. It is a\nfast-paced movie so if you're attention wanders you will miss things.\nBut I promise you if you have an open mind, an IQ somewhere above\nroom-temperature and any sense of humor at all, you should really enjoy\nthis little gem. We saw this movie on a home TV and I regretted that\nbecause I'll bet this film is absolutely outstanding on a big screen.\nIt's not meant to be anything particularly deep or meaningful, just a\nfun couple of hours. Relax, and enjoy. It is well worth the watching!\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel is directed by Wes Anderson and has been\nnominated for Best Picture Oscar. It is a story of a man sharing his\nlife's story as he was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of a famous concierge for a grand\nhotel. The ups and downs of life in the hospitality industry is quite\nan adventure. There is even a mystery involving a famous painting in\nthe mix. A marvelous tale from an era when hotels were stately and full\nof wonder. This movie is a bit static at times and long winded. But the\nscenery is full of old school class. The shifting back and forth can be\nconfusing at time. But the relationships are good and the characters\nrich.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst I've watched this movie two times till now...only because to see\nthe art behind this movie. This is the first movie I've watched of WES\nANDERSEN. And want to see more. Wes Andersen made this fast forward\nmovie very good in 4:4 square movie camera. the story telling of this\nmovie is also very good... the film is very fast forward so not at all\nboring. and <br><br>i think this is total movie. if you want good acting, sound composing,\nand good directing. watch this movie... Ralph Finns made great\nacting....yes \"Voldemort\" from harry potter... <br><br>by this film you see a new genre awaiting and it is called \"ART\".<br><br>and Alexandre Desplate has very good soundtrack... Hope can Win Most of\nthe Oscars..<br><br>This film has combination of Comedy, Emotions, Sadness, and\nsatisfactions, and Smoothness, and at last happiness.\n"},
{"review": "\nWes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel is arguably one of the best\ncomedic films ever made along with Some Like It Hot (1959), The\nProducers (1968), Good, Morning Vietnam (1987), Groundhog Day (1993),\nThe Apartment (1960), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Roman Holiday\n(1953), It Happened One Night (1934) and so many more. As the film\nopens we see an author (played by Tom Wilkinson) who talks about his\ndays back then while at the grand Budapest hotel (who is now played by\nJude Law) and sees a man named Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray\nAbraham) and talks to him about his times with Monsieur Gustave (played\nby Ralph Fiennes) as the lobby boy of the hotel. Out of the 9 Oscar\nnominations that his film received I really think it should win 2 for\nbest costume design, and best production design, the casting to this\nfilm is excellent (besides Fiennes, Abraham, Wilkinson, and Law) it\nalso includes Willem Dafoe as a hit-man, Jeff Goldblum as a lawyer, as\nwell as Wes Anderson regular Bill Murray as a hotel staff member, and\nSaiorse Ronan as the lobby boy's wife Agatha, as well as Adrien Brody\nas Gustave's nemesis Dimitri, and the unrecognizable Tilda Swinton as\nthe old woman who stayed at the hotel for 19 years and was found dead\nin her bed from strychnine poisoning. When I first laid eyes on this\nmovie I literally fell in love with it's humor, it's casting choices,\nit's story, it's set design, and it's costumes. This is one of 2014's\nbest films.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen I first seen the TV commercials for this film I was very curious\nof what it may hold. Here I am, nearly a year after. After watching the\nfilm I was certainly impressed and satisfied, for what I seen in the\ntrailers was a peachy movie. Now I see it as a perfect comedy/drama\nfilm. This film remains to this day (or the day that this is posted) my\nfavorite movie. Despite its \"perfect\" tone it is truly a amazing film\nand will go down in history (in my opinion) as one of the greatest\nfilms of all time. It was nominated for many awards and if I was to\ndecide, I think that all of them shall be awarded to them. Wes Anderson\nimpressed us all (if not most of us) once again.\n"},
{"review": "\nI decided to watch this movie when I heard about 9 Oscar nods it\nreceived .I initially thought it's going to be some overly-artistic\ndirector's ridiculously imaginative boring movie. But, it was totally,\nabsolutely different from what I expected. This movie turned out quite\nquirky, hilarious and sweet movie.<br><br>Plot was light-hearted and very very simple.One hell of Every element\nis breathtaking, electric. With a continuous ensemble of beautiful\nimages, an imaginative script, cinematography and brilliant comedic\ntiming, there is absolutely no lag. The entire film is beautifully on\npoint. This movie is a treat. For the eyes, for the ears, and also for\nthe heart.<br><br>A must watch feel good movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat I loved most about this film was its quirky nature-it felt almost\nlike I was being read a book and this was what my imagination was\nseeing. The storyline was cleverly put and I loved how it occasionally\nswitched from present day to the main storyline. The poetry was an\ninteresting touch, although I found it remarkably funny how the\nswearing just popped up every now and then, adding an altogether\ndifferent twist to the film. Whilst I don't wish to spoil anything for\nothers reading this review that have yet to watch the film, I think\nthat the combination of mystery, slight romance and fast-pace led to an\naltogether unique experience that I thoroughly enjoyed. A brilliant\nstoryline and a film that I would definitely recommend to anyone.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have not seen any of Wes Anderson's work, but after watching this i\nam keen to watch more of his films. THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is a story\nabout the concierge of the hotel and its lobby boy's attempt to escape\nfrom a murder framed on Ralph Fiennes(The concierge)by one of the\ncharacters in the film. I am not revealing anything to you , its just\nthe sheer work of absolute brilliant filmmaking and the extraordinary\nidea of creating a mind boggling effect by putting three different\nscreen ratios for three different era's. the screen ratios are perfect\nand have absolutely well blended with the different cinematography and\nproduction design used in this film. Ralph Fiennes' performance was\nwonderful as well as that of F. Murray Abraham's. I would recommend\nevery one of you who is reading my review to watch this splendid movie\nright now, because this is a ride that you should not miss.\n"},
{"review": "\nI've just watched it on Netflix, several hours after the Academy Awards\ngave it 9 nominations. All of them are worthy. All the make-ups,\ncostumes, design, photography, etc., is exceptional. It's beautiful,\nwell-made and all this beauty is useful, serving the story. These\ncraftsmen put all their talents to make this film unforgettable. We\ncould watch it in 30 years, it'll be great forever. Besides, the film\nis a mix of comedy and a breathless thriller. Previous films by Wes\nAnderson were funnier, but the story was losing its interest after an\nhour or so. Here we have a story who's holding it all the way. It's\nimpossible not to laugh even when M. Gustave is in jail. It's well\nwritten. In the end, the most interesting part of the film is the cast.\nEvery member of it is good, and a lot of them are really great. They\nshould have nominated Ralph Fiennes for his portrayal of the concierge\nof this old hotel. He's brilliant and funny and just for him, you have\nto see this movie. The first time I've seen him on a screen was in\n\"Schindler's list\". I've never thought I could watch a film in which\nhe's so different and as good. He's a master.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe acting is good and the story is okay but I'm not a big fan of this\nmovie. Everything is laid out too precisely; everything is made to fit.\nAll the details are handed to the viewer; it's too easy. I never felt I\nhad to think about anything. Some people may like that but I don't.<br><br>I enjoy movies that challenge me; that engage my mind in some way. To\nunderstand, follow, and appreciate them, the viewer has to think. I\ndidn't get that with this movie. I also couldn't relate to any of the\ncharacters; they felt flat and one-dimensional. As a result, I didn't\nfeel invested. I simply did not care about them or their outcomes.<br><br>Really, I'm not trying to bash the movie. I just felt it was too basic,\ntoo simplistic for my taste. This stripped down style of storytelling\nseems to be used often by Wes Anderson. I hadn't realized it but I've\nseen quite a few of his films. I don't remember them all but the most\nrecent I've seen, Moonrise Kingdom and Darjeeling Limited, have a very\nsimilar feel as TGBH. In fact, that's how I realized they were related.\n"},
{"review": "\nFun, is the word I think best describes The Grand Budapest Hotel. From\nbeginning to end this movie will have you grinning like an idiot.

{"review": "\nA simple, straightforward story of people with very human failings of\nlove, greed, compassion, and desire so beautifully told.<br><br>A peaceful, lilting tale of colour, laughter, and more than a hint of\nnostalgia.

All marks of a movie that is beautifully made.<br><br>To use the most routine of phrases, like Moonrise Kingdon (another of\nmy favourites) this is Wes Anderson crafting a movie with love.

{"review": "\nWes Anderson is really consistent with crafting extremely well-made\nfilms. His awesome attention to detail and how he shoots his movies won\nme over with Moonrise and now, with, GBH I'm convinced Wes Anderson is\none of the best, original directors we have today. There's a lot going\non in this movie: A girl is visiting a memorial and reading a book by a\nNameless Author. Meanwhile, the Author narrates this book for us about\na lonely hotel owner who then tells the Author a story about his start\nas a young Lobby Boy being trained by the then hotel concierge. There's\na painting theft, a ski chase, a great and suspenseful museum foot\nchase. This movie is on through the entire time. When it's not giving\nyou a scene filled with great dialog from it's wonderful cast, you're\nadmiring the typically beautiful set design. The script does a great\njob of using each setting in the movie and throwing in some\nsurprisingly intense sequences. That museum scene is my favorite and\nthere's awesomely shot shootout at the end that kind acts as a cherry\non top of the sundae. The dream team cast is near perfect, as with all\nWes Anderson movies. Ralph Feinnes is brilliant and carries the movie\nIMO, any man that can go from the evil Dark Lord to leading a comedy\nand nailing it is aces in my book. There's a lot of cool smaller roles,\nWillem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum stand out. Again this film is\ntechnically flawless as well. The cinematography and music fit well and\ndirection is perfect. I easily recommend a purchase for Wes Anderson\nand film fans. Casual movie goers might enjoy a rental.\n"},
{"review": "\nA living poster boy for the auteur theory, Wes Anderson makes movies so\nidiosyncratic - the surreal humor, the whimsical/bittersweet tone, the\ndistinctive visual style with pastel color palettes and quick\ncut-aways, an uncanny ability to marry images and music, weird but\nsympathetic father figures - that if you ended up 4000 years in the\nfuture with a time machine and found footage of a two minutes scene\nfrom an unreleased work by him, you'd recognize it at once. Of course,\na deadpan Bill Murray would be in it somewhere.<br><br>A choral story focused on a murder mystery and a mitteleuropean luxury\nhotel, the movie finds its center in the relationship between concierge\nGustave (Ralph Fiennes in a phenomenal comedic performance) and his\nlobby boy/prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero (Tony Revolory). Among the rest of the huge\ncast, Willem Dafoe as an ogre-like hit-man and Saoirse Ronan as a young\nbaker have the most significant roles, plus Jude Law and F. Murray\nAbraham providing the narrative frame as a writer interviewing an adult\nZero. Anderson's aficionados Murray, Wilson and Schwartzman have small\ncameos.<br><br>The director crafts his tableaux with meticulous attention. See how the\nunstoppable determination of Dafoe's killer is conveyed through his\nconstant movement, as he appears to be menacingly propelled towards the\nviewer; how the passage of time at the Grand Budapest is portrayed with\na change in the dominant color palette; how in their scenes together\nmentor Gustave always occupies the left side of the screen and Zero the\nright one, only for this to be reversed with older Zero and the writer.<br><br>The Grand Budapest Hotel is yet more Anderson quirkiness - he has done\nall this before, and better. From another director it would feel like\nstagnation, but since nobody else at the present does what he does,\nit's still quite welcome. To quote the movie, he certainly sustains the\nillusion with marvellous grace.<br><br>7/10\n"},
