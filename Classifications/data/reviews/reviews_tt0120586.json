{"review": "\n\nI honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History\nX in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am\nan avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just\nunbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His\nperformance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character\nthat he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The\nlook on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is\npurely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful.\nIt really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life,\nand provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that\ncreate a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have\nlong awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as\nDerek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as\nmyself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely\ncaptivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if\nEdward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts.\nIt's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear,\nwhich was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the\nlittle kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was\nstunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I\ndon't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as\nthis one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for\nviolent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why\ndirector Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate\nthis movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would\ngive it an A+ with all of my heart.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nA good friend of mine suggested this film, and I really didnt know what to\nexpect going in, but after this film was over, I sat in stunned silence. I\nknew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it does\nnot come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...and\nthe realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always\nthe\nway things are. Edward Norton's performance takes the viewer through this\njourney, and its not a pretty one. He goes from an bright young man, to a\nvengeful bigot, to a remorseful excon with a brothers life in jeopardy, and\nyou feel as though you are looking in on someones life in the course of 2\nhrs. All of the acting in this film is first rate, and the ending wasnt\nquite as predictable as others might have you believe...it is quite\nshocking, as is much of the film. It causes quite a debate on the way\npeople\nview others whos skin color is not the same. As Dr. King said, judge me not\non the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. I live with\nracism, because I am a black man living in America...it exists, but if we\neducate ourselves like the main character in AHX, it wont stay around for\nmuch longer. Hopefully it wont be too late, as it was for him. Peace and\nLove, JB33  Rating 5 stars\n"},

The story itself isn't that\ncomplicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points\neven predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is\nnot a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to\nthe racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution\nto the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious\ncircle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the\ndangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment\nwhen you're thinking as a white supremacist.<br><br>As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think\nthat its a really good and important thing that this movie is often\nshown in classrooms.<br><br>Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well\nbelievable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns\ninto in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters\nand he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong\nwho we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton\nare both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as\ntwo brothers.<br><br>Also surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had\nalready won an Oscar for \"The Full Monty\", the year before.<br><br>This was a movie that surprisingly impressed me.

{"review": "\n\nAmerican History X is one of the most powerful movies released in years. Not\nsince Schindler's List has the subject of racism been so potently presented.\nThe use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is\namazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story\nflawlessly. <br><br>Derek Vineyard's (Edward Norton) transition from a white supremacy leader's\nprotege to a gang leader himself to a changed man is shown mainly through a\nseries of flashbacks to the time before he was sent to prison. The character\ndevelopment and story are amazingly well done, and this is largely a factor\nof the high quality of the acting. Edward Norton especially, but also Edward\nFurlong, Beverly D'Angelo, and all of the rest of the cast down to Avery\nBrooks as Bob Sweeney, the African American high school teacher who comes up\nwith the term American History X, and Stacy Keach as the wonderfully\nhateable Cameron Alexander. Keach, by the way, would have been the perfect\nchoice to play Francis Dolarhyde in Manhunter, the film the precedes The\nSilence of the Lambs, but oh well. <br><br>Unfortunately, despite the fact that American History X is one of the best\nfilms in years, it is horribly underrated. Much like Norton's last film,\nPrimal Fear, which was also a great movie, this movie did not get nearly the\nrecognition that it deserves. \n"},

This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes\nyou frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward\nNorton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and\neven more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he\nwas and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does\nan amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even\ndescribe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward\nNorton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was\nabsolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... This\nmovie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that\nsome place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my\nheart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at\nleast once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth\nit!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a fantastic movie because no matter what side you're on in\nlife, this movie shows them all, good and bad, right or wrong. I also\nagree with the point in the movie that proves that people can change\nfor the better and straighten things out in their head to do the right\nthings in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the\ngood, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some\nof it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things \"your way\"\nand this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks\nabout all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs\nare right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also\ntruthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present.\nThis movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to\nthe dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and\nyour mind will come out full.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWhen I first heard of \"American History X,\" I thought it was going to be\n\"just another movie.\" Man, was I wrong! The first time I watched it, I sat\nthere as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This\nmovie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism,\nreally\nmade me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way\nthat Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed\ndue to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have\nany racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot\nmore than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal\nof\nexactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation\nsimply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for\nalmost no reason at all. The Bible says that \"God created man in his own\nimage.\" It also says to, \"Love your neighbor as yourself,\" which, right\nthere, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I\nwouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to\nits\ngraphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over\nthe age of 16, should see this movie at least once. This way, more people\nwill get a chance to see the true consequences of racism, and how it can\neasily tear apart a family.\n"},

{"review": "\n\nIn just a short career, Edward Norton has emerged as the best actor of his\ngeneration. 5 films, 2 oscar nominations, and the best performance I have\never seen turned in by a modern actor.

No\nlonger, the sweet innocent psychopath he was in Primal Fear, Norton bulked\nup considerably for this role and it pays off.<br><br>It is, hands down, the most powerful American film in decades.

{"review": "\n\nConsider this: an ultra-low-budget movie on the subject of racism, with no\nCGI and few special effects of any kind, with all of the action taking place\non two or three sets, the plotline basically consisting of two or three\npeople talking at a time punctuated by occasional outbursts of\nno-holds-barred violence, a massive downer of an ending, and not starring\nthe usual assortment of Hollywood stars. Sounds like an indie for sure,\nright? But it's not. It was a Hollywood film, although for the life of me I\ncan't imagine how any major studio got behind it. AHX is one of the best\nfilms of the decade if not of all time.

Edward\nNorton specially REALLY looks a skinhead, showing all his anger and\nawesome body in this movie.<br><br>I like the end of this movie (who is very sad by the way, since I liked\nthe character Danny very much)showing how hate and violence only makes\neven more hate and violence, in a effect like a snowball.The other\nending that never was filmed, in which Derek shaves his head again in\nthe school bathroom,would not help very much with a good message, but\nit could have some sense, showing that the prejudice and the racism\nwill continue no matter what we try to solve it.

{"review": "\nMy 9/10 rating is because \"American History X\" is very well done in\nevery way, except that it seems that when Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton)\nstarted spouting out the anti-Semitic diatribe, they should have asked\nhim what became of his humanity.

For\nexample, when Derek is in jail and gets to know a black man for the\nfirst time, his anger starts to ebb.

{"review": "\n\nSpoilers herein.<br><br>I found Ed Norton to be a plausible foil in `Fight Club,' but a simple\nmugger in `The Score.' I sought this out to discover whether he should be on\na list to watch or not -- this being a picture he influenced\nheavily.<br><br>It is a mess. It is a mess because the director was too callow to have and\nimpose a vision. So we get lots of different visions depending on the\ncomposition of the moment and the elements involved. One of those elements\nis Norton himself. I continue to maintain that the actor should never be in\ncharge of the vision: he just has an entirely different set of concerns. One\ncan see the scenes that Norton rips away from the director and sets up as\nbillboards for himself.<br><br>There are times when this can work. Scorsese seems to have explored more\nthan all of them. It doesn't work here. This material demands that it be\ncentered in large numbers of `ordinary' people. The impact is that this\ncould be widespread, not just isolated to one movieland character. But\nNorton sucks all the attention out of the story.<br><br>The material demands ambiguity. But the center is an unwaveringly decent\nblack schoolteacher, as artificial a character as Norton's.<br><br>The material attempts some sort of reflection through the term paper/diary\nreflections of the brother. But this is clumsily written and ends up as\nsimple narration, usually the sign of poor visual storytelling.<br><br>There is self-reference of sorts between Norton and his character.

The main theme is racism, but I\ndidn't feel this movie explored it in a completely satisfying way, or\nat least in a way I haven't seen before. The story was pretty simple:\nthe guy is a delinquent (Neo-Nazi), we see his life, he goes to prison,\ngets some kind of a realization after bonding with a black man, decides\nthat his past lifestyle was wrong and becomes a better man after he's\nreleased from prison.<br><br>At some points of the movie, I felt that the actions by some characters\nweren't appropriate or literally came out of nowhere with no build up\nlike Derek murdering people in the middle of the street. And the moment\nat which film didn't do well was the most important one - the scene in\nwhich Derek realizes the consequences of his actions, how bad of a\nperson he was and how little he devoted himself to his family. It just\nleft me unsatisfied. It wasn't captured very well. The events that were\nsupposed to lead him to this point lacked a bit in the execution\ndepartment. The script left much to be desired here.<br><br>With that said, this is not a bad movie. There are some great\nperformances here. Norton and Furlong did a particularly great job.\nDanny's tragic fate also offers something to think about.

By showing Edward Norton's\njail-stay in flashback, when we already know he's grew disillusioned\nwith the movement, all dramatic interest is removed from the scenes.\nAnd the method of his conversion was so trite as to be laughable. While\nhis prison scenes should have been the most powerful part of the movie,\nthey just felt like a waste of time (and using B&amp;W for the past is such\nan embarrassingly Hollywood device).<br><br>Secondly, the script is just terrible. You feel embarrassed for the\nactors as they're forced to talk entirely in polemic. Characters just\ndidn't talk or relate to each other in a way similar to how people talk\nor relate to each other. And I felt American History X's take on\nviolence was too cartoonish, where it should have felt genuine. The\nscenes felt adapted from action movies, whether the scene was\nsufficiently brutal or not doesn't make it better or worse.<br><br>You have to review artwork based on what the artist was trying to do,\nand how well he did it. The movie was trying to provide insight in the\nneo-Nazi mentality, while providing insight into the real cause of the\nracial violence. However, the unrealistic characters and the\nHollywood-ish take on violence left the movie flat in both regards.\n\n"},

{"review": "\n\"American History X\" is not a weak, fluffy, cutely wrapped after school\nspecial on racism, life in the 'hood, life in prison, and breaking the\ncycle. \"American History X\" is powerful and hits like an anvil. Edward\nNorton does an excellent job as Derek Vinyard, a venomous, hateful\nleader of a local gang of skinheads.<br><br>The movie takes a singular look at a young man who is entrenched in the\nWhite Supremist movement, then how he emerged from that life, and even\nhow he started down that path to begin with. Of course most people\ndon't like racist bigots and the movie shows the very ugly nature of\nthe skinheads/Arian Brotherhood. But the movie also shows the\ninteraction between the Whites and Blacks in the 'hoods of L.A. There\nwas by no means an angelic depiction of the African-Americans in this\nfilm. A few of the blacks shown were thugs who in part helped shape the\nviews that Derek and his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) held as White\nSupremists, but there were also a couple of key African-American\ncharacters that helped to reshape the views of Derek and Danny.<br><br>\"American History X\" made sure to do it right and make it true to life.\nThe life Derek had before prison, the life inside of prison with the\nsegregation and the gangs, and his life after prison as a changed man.\nThis was no \"Mississippi Burning\" or \"Rosewood\" detailing events of the\npast, rather this was a movie showing the present, the good and bad in\nboth parties, and the different ways people can be reformed.\n"},

The basketball\nscene itself is so silly, it single-handedly destroys any credibility this\nfilm might have had.  Others have already noted the unbelievable dinner and\nprison scenes as well.  A lifetime of hate - instant contrition.  How can\nanyone possibly take this thing seriously?

{"review": "\n\nThe problem with \"American History X\" has nothing to do with the acting. \nEdward Norton and Edward Furlong are both convincing and terrific, despite\nthe fact that Norton's character seems more like a misguided youth than a\nevil neo-nazi (the brutality of his crimes seemed to exist only to mask this\nimpression).  The fact is that it tries to cram too much into too little. \nIdeas and characters are presented that are never followed up on and thus\nthe film seems disjointed.  Despite the fact that Norton's character broke\nthrough a lot of the typical characteristics that typify the neo nazi, the\nprison scenes contain characters that exemplify many these stereotypes.  The\nwell rounded characters (such as Guy Torry as the laundry guy in prison) are\ncanceled out by poorly developed ones (Faruiza Balk and Ethan Suplee as a\ncouple of dunce nazi followers).  The flashbacks really aren't that well\nplaced in my opinion.  The opening scene presented  Norton's character with\nsimply too much brutality, and seemed designed to do nothing more than shock\nthe audience.  The scenes that supposedly develop the background of the\nNorton character are really pointless and do not at all indicate the  nature\nof his beliefs.  His dad telling him that affirmative action is wrong is not\nthe reason he became a crazed nazi.  Tony Kaye clearly wasn't thrilled with\nthe final product, as evidenced by his bizarre \"Humpty Dumpty\" scandal.  He\njust didn't get all of what he wanted on to the screen.  The overrated\nreaction to this movie is hard to explain.  Emotionally, the film is fairly\npowerful and contains a great ending, though it is a bit too preachy.

The movie is a roller coaster\nride that I felt should have ended on a high note. Sure, I am not a fan\nof the clich\u00e9 \"perfect Hollywood ending\". However, this is one film\nthat I felt should not have ended in the most depressing way\nimaginable. <br><br>I have read some comments on IMDb.com about the director having\nproblems with the ending. He even went so far as trying to have his\nname taken off the credits and replaced with \"Humpty Dumpty\". I must\nsay that I agree with him. Since I know that the younger brother will\ndie in the end it prevents me from watching this movie very often as it\nis just too depressing. I think a good alternative ending would have\nNorton's character held back for the rest of his life by his record. He\nis way too intelligent to enjoy life while having to work as some sort\nof laborer for the rest of his life. The irony would have been \"an eye\nfor an eye\" as he ruined lives by committing manslaughter and there is\nnothing worse for an extremely smart person to dig ditches for a\nliving. This is something I can definitely relate to. However, his\nyounger brother often supports him financially in the future as a\npayback for saving him from a life of \"naziism\". Norton's character is\npunished for his sins, yet there is some redemption for turning his\nback on the nazi's which regarded him as a hero. <br><br>That is how I would have ended the movie if I was given the script.\nThis alternate ending would be far from your stock \"Hollywood happy\nending\", without being so depressing.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis was a great movie that shows how people change how once you open\nyour mind to feelings and listen to other people you realize that your\nnot always right. the only problem that i had with the film is that\nthey only show the Nazi skins which for people who don't have a clue\nabout skinheads and believe that there are only racist skins is very\nbad because there are 3 types the racist are called boneheads the anti\nracist skins are called SHARPS and the third are called trad skins or\ntraditional skins which is about helping the working class who ever\nthey are. movies like this are great but because they are so great they\nhave very persuasive powers and when there's only one side of certain\nthings shown it can affects people greatly. I'm a trad skin and because\nof American history x several people have wanted to beat me up just\nbecause they don't know the whole truth. this is a good movie but\ndoesn't show everything plus the fat Nazi in the movie has an ANTIHERO\ntattoo and antihero is an awesome band and the movie used there tattoo\nwithout permission which affects them cause there not racist.\n"},
{"review": "\nI watched this movie for the first time this year (2006) when a friend\nof mine lent me this,. I had heard about it and wondered but had no\nidea of what to expect. It is the most powerful movie I have ever seen\nin my forty nine years. I had recently returned from Los Angeles and\nthe beach area after having experienced real life gangs there and was\nworking on a novel following up on these experiences. I don't know if\nwe can ever really solve the underlying racial attitudes that prevail\nin this country. I also saw much of the 'white backlash' recently when\nI was out there and saw all of the characters as believable (both white\nand black) portraying the different gangs and why they hate each other\nand are ready to take it to the death. I feel this movie will help\nyoung people try and realize the consequences of racial escalation. I\nunfortunately feel that this country will never solve this and\nunderstandably the movie leads us to believe this also. The best lesson\nis it takes the consequence of violence to either change or manipulate\nbehavior. As shown, it can go from one extreme to the other without\nresolve. Be prepared with this movie as it leaves no judgement with\neither white nor black...\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is one of those movies everyone needs to see. The reality in it is\nnot beautiful. It can't be wrapped up in a pretty pink box. It's the\nkind of unbearable truth that should make you see that you are exactly\nthe same as Danny or Derek, even if you say in your head, \"I'm not that\nawful.\" It's painful because it has to be. <br><br>I think this is the film that has the capacity to revolutionize our\nflawed society, if only to promote discussion and change some minds. <br><br>Ignorance only spawns further ignorance, so see it; hear the message. I\nrecommend seeing it with children old enough to tolerate violence and\nlook beyond it. Talk about the themes of the movie with kids, as, in my\nopinion, this film was created to spark conversation about the issues\nof hate, prejudice and defining one's self. I suggest this film for\nanyone who plans on living realistically in this \"quick to judge\" era.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie blew me away. I had heard of it a while ago but never got\nround to watching it. I cant tell you how glad i am that i did. First\noff, Ed Norton - already one of my favourite actors - is absolutely\nflawless in his portrayal of a Neo-Nazi (Derek) who gets locked up for\nmurdering two black thieves. When he comes out he realises what he has\ndone to himself and his family, which includes a superb Edward Furlong\nof Terminater 2 fame. Told through his eyes the story flashes back to\nthe incidents that lead Dereks incarceration and the impact it has on\nhim. Also featuring excellent performances from Ethan Suplee and\nFairuza Balk this film is the cream of the crop. If you haven't seen i\nsuggest you do - quick. But be sure you can handle plenty of profanity\n(the word f**k is used 205 times) and some disturbing and brutal\nviolence.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie will shatter your idea about race relations in the United\nStates. Unlike the hot new Oscar Winning movie about race \"Crash\" which\nwas much more contrived and star-studded, \"American History X\" features\nthe gritty and realistic side of racism instead.<br><br>Filmed both in Black and White (with the scenes involving the past\nevents) and color (with the present tense) the film moved at a pace\nwhich totally envelopes the viewer. Even though some scenes are\nextremely graphic and often hard to watch, the violence and gore in the\nmovie is not gratouitous or without meaning. Each time there is a gun\nor a fist in this movie it is to make a serious point, and or a display\nof power from different characters.<br><br>Actors Edward Norton and Edward Furlong offer the performances of both\nof there lifetimes as the closely knit brothers Danny and Derek.\nNorton, as Derek, is especially chilling as a Neo-Nazi turned\nRedemption Seeker in the story.<br><br>This is an extremely important and very timely movie. See it with your\nfamily members and with people who may not fully understand the\nimportance of race relations in the United States.\n"},
{"review": "\nA truly brilliant piece of film making, it is seen through the eyes of\nDanny who's brother, Derek got 3 years in prison for the murder of\nthree black car jackers, Derek was a neo-Nazi skinhead, you see his\ntime in prison in a series of flashback style shots, when Derek gets\nout of jail he is a changed man, he has left behind his racist past,\nbut when he gets out of jail he finds that Danny has gone down the same\nevil, racist road that he had. It all happens over a 24 hour period as\nDerek tries desperately to save his brother from the same hate fuelled\nbigotry that consumed his life and got him jailed, you find that it was\nthe friendship of a black inmate that made Derek change his views. He\nmanages to change his brothers views but is it too late to protect\nDanny from his earlier mistakes? There are fantastic performances from\nboth Norton and Furlong and I would find it almost impossible to not\ngive this film 10 out of 10. The film is a compelling tribute to the\nunrelenting human spirit and its ability to overcome the intolerable.\nLike Danny did in the film i will end this review with a couple of\nquotes that i think fit well with this film: 'those who can make you\nbelieve absurdities can make you commit atrocities', 'The world is a\ndangerous place, not because of those who do evil but because of those\nwho look on and do nothing.' PROMOTE THE PEACE.\n"},
{"review": "\nQuite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. This movie not only has\nan amazing story, but the artistic value is tremendous. The stark\ncontrast between the black and white scenes versus the color adds so\nmuch to the film. I can't remember another movie that I've seen that\nimpressed me so much artistically.<br><br>Norton embodies his character so well, as does Furlong. They go beyond\ncharacters on a screen to create a relationship between them and the\nviewer. By the end of the movie it's as if you've known them and been a\npart of their struggle.<br><br>If you've not seen this movie, you should make it a priority.\n"},
{"review": "\nAt the start of this film, I didn't know what to make of it. I found\nthe music quite irritating, but I think thats just my opinion, I just\nprefer things to be less obvious , so I don't like too much music\ntrying to explain situations for me, but once I had adjusted, I really\ndid enjoy this film. <br><br>Edward Norton gives a very good, believable performance, and the rest\nof the acting is also very good- there are moments when you can look\ninto the actors' eyes and see the characters' madness, their fear,\ntheir sorrow, but don't be put off by this- it is morbid, but it isn't\ncompletely depressing. It makes some very good points and has some very\nstrong scenes. The timing is also often perfect, with perfect reactions\nfrom the actors' which makes the chaos seem realistic. It's also not\ntoo predictable which is good, and the way it is set out allows it to\nbe cleverly unravelled<br><br>Very good, I recommend it.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have just finished watching this film for the 3rd time and it still\nshocks me. Without doubt it is one of the most controversial films ever\nto be produced.<br><br>The first thing that strikes me as a viewer is the direction and\ncinematography which is apparent from the opening scenes. ALthough it\nis clich\u00e9 to say that black and white is 'powerful' i believe it is the\nlighting in these scenes that make it so. The shadowy look of the room\nDerek and Stacy are in highlights the darkness surrounding the period\nof time that the scene takes place. Throughout the film the cut scenes,\nflash backs and numerous slow-mo close ups are seamlessly directed and\nprovide the intensity needed for a film based on such an important and\nrage-filled subject.<br><br>The subject is something that the viewer will be aware of before\nwatching the film but when it is explored by Tony Kaye, this is where\nis enthrals me. This could so easily have been a mediocre film about\nrace without the intelligence shown in the script. For instance the\nargument between Derek and Murray and more specifically Dereks speech\nat the dinner table brings to light the political awareness of David\nMcKenna. This way of at least showing that some of the base views\nshrouded by racism are actually logical is something that makes the\nfilm engrossing.<br><br>Perhaps the most engrossing factor of the film is the plot and\ncharacterisation. The 'bad boy turned good' plot is initially not\nparticularly original but the way Edward Norton and Edward Furlong\nportray this is fantastic. How Norton captures the emotions of a man in\nturmoil is exceptional and will always be one of the most memorable\nperformances i have witnessed in film.<br><br>American History X has been widely critically acclaimed and so it\nshould be. It is brilliantly directed and expertly written so much so\nthat a person who watches this film will not only be shocked but\nabsorbed into the political aspects of it.\n"},
{"review": "\nAmerican History X shows an excellent transition from hate to\nunderstanding through friendship and family ties. As a teacher in a\ntreatment facility I see these types of behaviors daily. My job is to\nhelp the residents keep up with school as long as they are in the\nfacility for treatment. Whether they are in for emotional issues or\nchemical dependency issues, they all have behaviors that they feel are\nnecessary for survival. Ed's character - Derek - undergoes a life\naltering behavior/attitude change that is surprising as well as\nbelievable. The writing and acting teams did an exceptional job\nportraying the changes necessary to make the movie complete and\nmemorable. This is a movie that I will buy.\n"},
{"review": "\nOf all the thought provoking and absorbing movies I've seen, American\nHistory X is placed right at the top. A superb plot combined with\nmagnificent acting makes this one of the all time greats. From the\nfilms opening scenes to its gripping, knife-edge conclusion, the film\npowefully portrays one man's struggle to assimilate back into society\nafter serving a prison sentence for race related crimes. The film\nweaves ingeniously between the flashbacks and the present state of\nEdward Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, a one time neo-Nazi, who's\nviolent hatred of America's multi-cultural society culminates in the\nbrutal murder of two men. Derek's imprisonment proves to be a\nlife-changing experience, as upon his release he appears to his adoring\nfamily and friends as a reformed man, who's appearance, beliefs &amp;\nideology have drastically changed. With a clean slate, Derek now faces\nthe gruelling challenge of rescuing his brother from following the same\ndoomed path which resulted in his own incarceration. I was genuinely\nabsorbed with this film from start to finish and although fictional, I\nfelt it fully demonstrated the dangers and damaging consequences of\nracism. Norton's tremendous acting complements a clever storyline,\nwhich still leaves me in suspense every time.\n"},

A superb script and excellent direction\nmake a film that is emotionally gripping, politically powerful and\nentertaining.

I do wonder why he didn't get an Oscar or nomination for this\nrather than Primal Fear. He was good in Primal Fear but much better in\nX. It was a little like seeing Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking, totally\nconvincing performance. Also made me think how frightening it is when\nyou are faced with those who are so narrow minded as were a lot his\nfriends in the film, and proof of how much peer pressure is a strong\ninfluence on not just the young but on us all.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen i started to watch this movie I thought is was just be another\ncrappy documentary about the Neo-Nazis and their uprising. I have seen\na lot of them on the History Channel and they all suck! But as I\nwatched the movie further and further I realized it was more emotional\nthan I first perceived. The movie gave you true to life scenes of what\nit is to be a modern white Skinhead. All the parts were played\nperfectly, Edward Nortons' acting is superb. He plays the role so\nstrongly that sometimes you believe that he REALLY is a Nazi (althought\nhe is not). The drama in this movie is so realistic and very violent\ntoo. For example there is a scene is this movie where Derek Vinyard\n(Edward Norton) is in prison and gets raped by his fellow Skinheads\nbecause Derek believed they did not convey the views of the Aryan\n(Neo-Nazi) brotherhood like they were supposed to. Furthermore, after\nhe is raped, one of his old history teacher in high school talks to him\nabout his brother Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong: T2 actor). Daniel is\nDerek's older brother and he is killed at the end of the movie because\nhe was a skinhead. Overall this movie is so true to life that it seems\nlike a documentary but it is a movie.

Although i would not suggest watching\nmovies like this if you do not like violence, racism, or harsh words.\nI'm not saying I'm a racist or anything like that but i really did like\nthis movie\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie definitely brought a new perspective of society to my\nknowledge. Before seeing this movie a couple of years ago, I wasn't\naware that there were skinheads in modern day.

It is a great movie and\nit will definitely pertain to modern society in 5, 10, 20 years because\nthese issues still haven't stopped.

{"review": "\nAmericam History X,is a very good movie. I saw it when it first came\nout in the theaters, and I was directly changed on some of my point of\nviews, that I had before the movie. Edward Norton, which gained about\n30 pounds of muscle for this movie was astonishingly, with his roll and\nhow he played it. Edward Furlong also played a good role. Here is a\nreview of the movie. The story follows an intelligent young man named\nDerek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and his decline into the world of\ndisillusion and hate known as White Supremacy. Derek Vinyard (Edward\nNorton) buffed up to 190 pounds, with a shaved head, swastika tattoo,\nbiker goatee and a feral, angry gaze, he is one scary image. Once a\nthoughtful and easy-going teen, he soon begins his change when his\ncasually racist firefighter father is killed while trying to put out a\nfire in a black neighborhood. Falling under the wind of a neo-Nazi\n(Stacy Keach), Derek becomes a recruiting agent for local white kids.\nWhile the local movement grows, Derek gets deeper and deeper in,\npolluted more and more by hate. This all comes together when Derek\nkills two black gang members who tried to steal his truck. He is caught\nand sent to jail, where he is shown the error of his ways. The hard\nway. With the help of one of his former teachers (Avery Brooks), Derek\nbegins to reform. However, it may be too little too late. While Derek\nwas in prison, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is starting\nto head down the same path. Now, aside from trying to leave the world\nhe created he has to save his little brother from it too. I had do to a\nmovie review for my English class so I watched the movie again, and I\nwas not nearly as pleased as the first time. The movie seemed kind of\nall fake and so played out. You knew what was going to happen next. So\nI guess if I was you I would only see it once, and I would definitely\nnot buy the DVD unless you collect movies, because this would be a very\ngood movie to add to your collection.\n"},

The director\nportrays the issue of neo-nazi's and rasism from the white supremist's\npoint of view. By the end of the movie you are sympathizing with Derick\nand his brother Danny, despite what they have done to blacks and other\nminorities. It shows how rasism starts and how usually starts at home.\nParents have a huge influence on how their kids view the world, and the\ndirector acknowleges this. What I also like about this movie is that it\nshows how people can change, but sometimes it is too late.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis movie is directly related to Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" where both\ncharacters experience the metamorphoses of: 1) Self-hate 2) Extreme\nhate of viewed opponents and oppressors 3) A balance and realization<br><br>I've learned a lot from these two movies. They speak directly of the\nbalance that exists everywhere, which is inevitable and everlasting.\nBalance always exists, but the process by which it is achieved can be\ndrastic and violent sometimes. (Derek kills two black men; later, his\nbrother is killed by a black teenager.) So, extremity can sometimes be\nthe only way to go about solving things, but it ultimately needs to\nbalanced out with logic. White supremacy in slavery leads to black\nsupremacy in the civil rights movement, which leads to white supremacy\nimmediately after. I used to think it was weak to be balanced in my\nviewpoints of the world. While it is okay to be angry and believe\nthings are unfair, finding balance is the ultimate outcome. Well,\neither you find balance for yourself, or balance finds you, and\nsometimes it isn't the most pleasurable lesson.<br><br>After birth comes death, and from death comes birth.\n"},
{"review": "\nDowngraded from an 11 out of 10 because of the graphic violence;\nhowever, the real reason for the excellent review is that without the\nviolence, the story would have been worth an 11 out of 10. Having seen\nthis movie the viewer will see bigotry portrayed as naked\ndiscrimination and the deceitful mask of warmongers mimicking great\npeaceful demonstrators hiding the excuses for war in other leaders\nsuccesses. This warns that seeking the same fame without the same\ndetermination and honor makes for the revelation of false motives. This\nmovie is a landmark in the industry. A must see for those who believe\nthat they have to hate someone. Neo-Nazi skin-heads are seen by the\nparents of the neighborhoods and find themselves reacting to the anger\nof a suppressed nation of black youths. They seek solace in the act of\nforming their own gangs, believing that there is safety in numbers. The\nstory unfolds to tell a very rich story that makes people realize why\nthere was such an attraction to hating another people for the lie of\nunifying themselves for a common cause, finding themselves divided.\n"},
{"review": "\none fine film. Many great points with suburb acting and camera work.\nOne finds the back and forth action handling to be just on target.\nGreat direction with some fine acting. One can quickly find many\nparallels to the present day world. Even though the \"f\" word is used\n204 times it somehow fits and doesn't feel to me overused as when Red\nFox does it. See the movie. Study the movie. Have your college\nprofessors use it in a film class. GREAT!!The dinner scene is one to be\nremembered with your own dinner scenes. The fact that a black man\ndefended him in prison was well used to point out that the Nazi's hated\nothers not like them. The hatred of others was shown to be foolish,\nfalse and just plain dumb.The younger brother was so easily taken in by\nthe older brother shows how easy we are lead by others and others\nideas. Fine film for discussion and to see at least six times.\n"},
{"review": "\nOne of my top 3 movies if not my favorite. Edward Norton and Edward\nFurlong give flawless performances and are very believable. I like how\nthey portrayed Norton as a white supremacist. Not as a redneck but as a\nnormal guy whose life is changed by a dramatic event, which leads him\nto join a skinhead group and later challenges his beliefs. Although the\nmovie is brutal and very graphic, It goes along with the plot unlike\nsome slasher movie just about gore. There is a reason to the violence\nand it shows during the course of the movie. This movie is not for the\neasily offended but I would recommend it to anyone that appreciates\ngood cinema and enjoys films that make you think.\n"},
{"review": "\nAmerican History X is THE best film I have ever seen in my life. The\nfilm is completely breathtaking with two immense performances. Edward\nNortons spell bounding performance receives so much praise and\nadmiration that I think Ed Furlongs performance is overshadowed. This\nis a complete shame as Furlong as absolutely spectacular in the role of\nDanny and portrays the \"young, angry white boy\" superbly. The film has\nno rest bite whatsoever and continuously amazes throughout. With most\nfilms there is a peak that you reach mid way through and then you can\nlook away and breathe, but American History X permanently shocks and\nsteals your breath. It is truly brilliant and Tony Kaye has definitely\nnever directed a film as good as this, and he is extremely unlikely to.\nIf you haven't seen it shame on you. If you have and you aren't in love\nwith it shame on you too. WAY WAY WAY BETTER than the Godfather, Pulp\nFiction, Lord Of The Rings and anything else you can show me.\n"},
{"review": "\nJesus, that was a wonderful film.From beginning to end,this movie is a\nwild mechanical bull ride.It begins sadly, and it ends yet worse. It\nwas really an emotional roller-coaster, at least it should be if you\nhave empathy towards other human beings.It is beautifully directed, i\nenjoyed the way in which the screen would turn black and white during\nflash backs, Edward Norton looked more impressive that way, and in slow\nmotion.I am not a Neo Nazi or Skin Head, but that tattoo which Norton's\ncharacter bore on his chest was simply amazing. He was a sort of\nFuhrer, for the twenty-first century, somebody who we could relate to\nbetter than we could Hitler, as gangs in the slums are something which\nis common today, and quite out of control.<br><br>Tony Kaye was an amazing director in this film, he delivered it quite\nrealistically, and it was hard not to be touched by such a dramatic\nseries of unfortunate events. This is not to mention Edward Norton's\nacting, which was even better than on the set of Fight Club. If you\nhave failed to see this movie yet, and you are a big movie fan, then\nyou are wasting your time by reading this. See it my friend...witness\nthe beauty American History X.\n"},
{"review": "\nTo me this powerful film shows Ed Norton as one of our most impressive\nand gifted actors of a generation. His excellent portrayal of Derek, a\nbrutal Nazi loving thug who through his life changing experiences in\nprison slowly realises the error of his ways. Supported by a fine\nperformance by Edward Furlong who plays his idolising, yet astute\nyounger brother Danny the film rolls a emotional ride of hate for\nblack, Jewish, Asian, if fact anyone who does not fit with Derek's view\nof a normal American to the love for his brother and other members of\nhis family. Extremely violent scenes in the film are not only justified\nto establish the utter ruthlessness of Derek but probably a true\nreflection of how these people live and think.\n"},
{"review": "\nDerek was a crazy racist before he was sent into the prison. His action\nalso affected greatly his younger brother Danny. Even Danny took him as\nhis model. But Derek got the most important lesson for him in the\nprison. After leaving the prison, he was not a racist anymore. Although\nhe tried to persuade Danny to abandon racial discrimination, Danny was\nstill killed by his black classmate.<br><br>At present racial discrimination not only happens in America, it is\nalso a headache for other countries. As advanced animal, the human\nbeing cannot live in harmony. That absolutely is shameful for the\nmankind. We have to learn much from the natural world. People are born\nto be equal, but we cannot respect each other. Only RD is eradicated,\nthe earth is just a good place to live for the mankind.<br><br>If Edward Norton won the Oscar award for this role, I will not be\nsurprised. He also had wonderful performance in Primal fear, Fight\nclub. He has the ability to play any role.<br><br>A movie worth everybody to watch and think. 9/10\n"},
{"review": "\nAmerican History X is a very important movie. It delivers its point\n(the effects and seeds of racism in middle-class America) unabashedly.\nAt points the film is grotesque (I won't say what, but I was trying to\ntell a friend about one scene and I couldn't even say it, it was so\ndisturbing!!!) and sickening. Even just the mindset of Derek (played\nMASTERFULLY by Edward Norton) at certain points in the movie was\nhorrifying. However, racism itself is a horrifying, electric issue that\nshould not be handled lightly. A movie to compare American History X\nwith is Crash, which tackles the issue of racism, but with a lot less\nsubtlety and sincerity. And though it bears an R rating, the film feels\nso restrained, like the actors made it just to have something\nactivist-ish on their resumes. American History X, however, shies away\nfrom no subject, and in its honesty delivers an uplifting message and a\ndire warning. The script and cinematography are excellent, but what\nstands out most is Edward Norton's performance. He is my favorite actor\n(and I don't take that title lightly), and gives a good reason why in\nAmerican History X. Such complex, wildly different emotions (his\napparent satisfaction killing some black men who were attempting to\nsteal his car, his turnaround, guilt, and utterly moving explosion of\ngrief at the end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall, an incredible movie.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis movie was a very touching movie, and I really enjoyed it. I had\nheard about it in the past, but I didn't seem too interested by just\nlooking at it's DVD cover. I heard from a friend that it is a really\ngood movie, and knowing that my friend and I are very similar in what\nwe enjoy for leisure, I figured I'd give it a try. I watched the movie\nand really enjoyed it. So much relation to reality and suspenseful\nalso. I really liked this movie, but I shouldn't ramble on and keep\ntelling you all that I enjoyed it. You should all just go see it, rent\nit, or buy it. I would buy it, because it is very worthwhile. The\nending is hardcore and it ends very sharply, but it makes complete\nsense if you watch the whole movie through. I give this movie a PERFECT\n10 for EXCELLENT storyline, plot, characters, and the outline of how it\nrelates to reality. GO SEE IT NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!\n"},
{"review": "\nI have seen American History X several times and now own the DVD. This\nis a superb film, with focus on Edward Norton's character, \"Derek\nVineyard.\" Derek is a neo-Nazi growing up in Venice Beach, CA. The film\nis very moving and a realistic account of race relations in Southern\nCalifornia, and also of the inner workings of prison life. The ending\nof the film was a bit sad, and was probably the weakest part of the\nfilm, in my opinion. The film moves along superbly, however, after\nDerek is released from Prison, he is a changed person, and in my\nopinion, I'm not so sure he would have done a complete 180 like that,\nhowever, it makes sense for the films sake. All in all, this is very\nwatchable. Certainly a rated R movie, very graphic and strong language.\n"},
{"review": "\nI don't know what it took me so long to see this movie, but i finally\ngot the chance to. This is one of the most greatest movies i have ever\nseen. I highly recommend that everyone watches it. Although that it may\nbe a little controversial and a little racist, it only depicts the\nlives of others and how people lived at the time. Although the ending\nwas a little upsetting, the way the movie was made was totally\nspectacular. For those of you who haven't seen it, you really have to.\nIt's a real must see.

{"review": "\nWithout a doubt one of the hardest films I've hard ever seen and I can\nsay honestly that it narrates a reality that unfortunately existed and\nthat increases every day. The interpretation of Edward Norton left me\ndumb, that glance that directed to camera when he was arrested\ntransmitted the true rage to me that feels this people inside them. I\nrecommend this film to everyone who is interested on knowing that the\nnew Nazi movements are not something to take as a joke, that reality is\nin the streets and this history shows the horrors that this people\ncommit. In my opinion the only failure that it has is that the\npersonality of the small brother is not too much worked. In addition I\nwant to say that the last lines that are read in the film have a\nmessage of which all we would have to learn: the life is too short to\nspend it being always upset.

{"review": "\nA seven is not a rating that I give freely. It takes a lot to impress\nand this movie has done that. Another perfect performance by Edward\nNorton his character shows the most depth of any on-screen. The film\nspeaks volumes about racism and prejudice in general. I loved the idea\nof doing all the flashbacks in black and white. Although I realize that\nthis is done in a lot of \"flashback\" type films, given the whole theme\nof the film I found it especially fitting. The characters in the movie\nsteal your heart, you spend half the movie hating them, and the other\nhalf feeling immensely sorry for their closed minded views.<br><br>The only reason that this movie didn't get an 8 or 9 rating is the\nending.

{"review": "\nLife's greatest lessons don't often come in little convenient packages\nand this movie is one that will teach you one aspect of American Life\nyou don't want to miss.

But times\nare different now. Maybe America wasn't meant to be the way it is now;\nmaybe the framers of this nation had in mind a different vision of what\na free land should've been. But, then again, if history has taught us\none thing, it is that we can not change history. We can change our\ndestiny. We can change the present if we set our minds to it. But we\ngotta act.

{"review": "\n\nAmerican History X has been by far one of the best movies I've ever\nviewed.

This movie is\nvery surreal and helps you depict the different views of the issues\ngoing on in this movie. I think the most emotional part of this movie\nwas the very end. I'm not going to ruin it but by the way the movie is\ntold. It's like everything just builds itself up to that very last\nscene.

{"review": "\n\nThis film is easily the best performance of Ed Norton's great career\nthusfar. He shows his blue collar side that will work hard to perfect\nhimself for any role. <br><br>The problem here is that the rest of the film lags behind his talent.\nHe has little help from the supporting cast, a poor director, and a\nvery soft script in some areas. My biggest problem with the film is\nthat the story was told with flashbacks. We miss out on a great\nopportunity to grow and change with Derek. The prison scenes are all\nbut pointless, since we already know he comes out reformed and\nnon-violent. Why should we bother watching the middle of the movie? I\nwould have liked this movie a lot more if it was done in linear\nfashion. <br><br>The movie also builds itself on shockingly violent and strong scenes.\nThese are done very well (the rape, the curb incident, the rant by\nDerek on the news after his father is killed, etc.) However, when we\naren't watching one of these scenes, the movie doesn't have much to\noffer.<br><br>The only member of the cast who does well in her role besides Norton is\nBeverly D'Angelo as the troubled mom. The Nazi influences in Derek and\nDanny's lives are all clich\u00e9d characters that add nothing to the film\n(Ethan Suplee, Faruiza Balk, Stacey Keach). Ed Furlong didn't sell me on\nhis character being a potentially violent skinhead. Also the attempts\nat building up the fraternal bond between Derek and Danny failed. It\nseemed like Norton was carrying Furlong through the whole scene at the\ndiner. <br><br>Overall i still gave the movie an 8. It seems like I've bashed it here,\nbut Norton was good enough to wow me, and part of me thinks we had no\nmore character development BECAUSE the director wanted Norton to carry\nthe movie.<br><br>Not a bad idea in the least. I was also a fan of the ending, the\nmessage was a simple one, but one that I happen to agree with\n\n"}
