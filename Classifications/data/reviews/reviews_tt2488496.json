{"review": "\nI was really looking forward to this movie even knowing that Abrams\nwill be directing it. And now I wish I didn't watch. It was just bad.\nNo other words for it.<br><br>Everyone already said about plot being just a random rehash of previous\nepisodes. We've already seen all situations, all locations, all plot\nturns. There's nothing original in this movie and it seems pointless in\ngeneral. <br><br>SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER<br><br>Some basics of the SW Universe are changed to accommodate the\ncharacters. Now a guy who is not a Force-user can fight with a trained\nSith using a lightsaber. Untrained Force-user can use jedi mindtricks\nwith no training at all. Sith can feel a non-Force-user from across\nconsiderable distance but not if the same man is standing 10 meters\napart from him. Stormtroopers see Sith have a fit if pointless\nhysterics and calmly walk away from him despite his summons. Light Side\nis a constant seduction to Siths. And so on and so on... It all feels\nlike a badly written fanfic.<br><br>END SPOILERS<br><br>And it is also filmed badly. In all Star Wars movies first appearance\nof ship or a planet always was a momentous scene. This is totally lost\nhere. Also there are many unflattering camera angles, poorly\nchoreographed scenes, battle sequences are rushed and not always\nthought-out. With modern technology and special effects it could have\nbeen magnificent, but instead it's cheaply looking. I've caught myself\nthinking that \"A New Hope\" looked better and more advanced than this\none.<br><br>Maybe if you've never watched Star Wars you will like this movie, but\nfor those familiar with old episodes it most probably will be a major\nlet down.<br><br>1 out of 10 just because it' impossible to give 0.\n"},
{"review": "\nStar Wars to me has always been about imagination.<br><br>There's a lot that has been said about George Lucas in the last forty\nyears, but there's one thing that can't be denied: he had imagination.<br><br>JJ Abrams however does not and it shows in The Force Awakens. Besides\nthe plot, which isn't original to say the least and has a lot of\nquestionable elements, the visual design is very bland and derivative.\nThe actual look and feel of the film reminds more of JJ's Star Trek\nfilms than of the original Star Wars trilogy, although luckily there\nare only a handful of lens flares to be seen.<br><br>Even the music sounds uninspired. Which is a shame since the music was\nalways one of the strongest parts of Star Wars.<br><br>All in all it's an extremely average film, which would have been fine\nif it wasn't Star Wars. Star Wars is about pushing the limits and the\nonly thing that was pushed here is your hype button.<br><br>The prequel trilogy was a misstep in a lot of aspects, but at least\nGeorge tried to innovate and create something new. The Force Awakens\nhowever is a big step backwards.\n"},

It's almost like a\nremake or homage to the original films.<br><br>The two main good characters are awfully skilled in lightsaber fighting\nand/or using the force considering they didn't even have a clue twenty\nminutes earlier and had no training in either. The main bad guy despite\nhaving training from the dark side appears average against the two\nnobody's who suddenly have discovered their remarkable skill.<br><br>Eye candy not brain candy.

{"review": "\nSo. I was under the impression, that this was supposed to be a sequel,\nnot a remake. It markets itself as a sequel, so there is no reason to\nthink of it as a reboot. Yet the plot and the characters were recycled\nfrom the old movies.<br><br>A Darth Vader wannabe, with a plan from ep. IV, a re-gendered Luke with\ngod mode powers turned on, female Yoda 2.0, etc. Whole scenes were\nremade. The plot was copy-pasted and yet they somehow managed to make\nit inconsistent. The characters were terribly profiled. I found storm\ntrooper kid totally laughable. Over-powered Rey was just the icing on\nthis disgusting cake. The acting was terrible, but even Orson Welles\ncouldn't make these fan-fic level characterizations work.<br><br>This movie is beyond unoriginal.

It makes me think that it's enough\nto tell people what they're supposed to like, to give some money to\nreviewers and everything's gonna be OK for you.<br><br>A disappointing movie in itself and as a cultural phenomenon. One of my\ngreatest cinematographic disappointments. Then again: makes me\nappreciate the prequels just a little bit more. Although they were\nterrible movies, they brought tons of new stuff to the table. I can't\nthink of anything original, this movie has brought, and lemme tell you:\nIT FEELS FRIGGIN' DEPRESSING! Is this ENOUGH for movie-goers and\ncritics? THIS?! I hate this movie with all of my heart, but I can't\nbring myself to give it less than 4/10, because it is technically well\nmade. On a very crude technical level... Even with 4/10 though, I never\nquite hated any movie like this one. I hate it with a passion. Been\ngiving people thumbs up merely for hating it because I think that it's\ngot far too much praise. It ran one of the most original franchises\ninto stale, unoriginal, politically correct derivative waters.... God I\nhate this movie so much, along with everything it represents, it makes\nme wanna cry.\n"},

The legacy of the iconic characters of the OT\n(particularly Luke) have been reduced to the point of them being almost\nunrecognizable losers.

The callousness use of nostalgia and modern day movie tactics ( fill\nit with action so that people don't notice the lack of story or meaning\n).<br><br>No meaningful scenes and a script that can only be described as written\nby teenagers. No new worlds, no new technology or civilizations. They\nmade a mockery out of the audience by using only a few scenes and\nmilking them until your eyes bleed. <br><br>Example: A scene with a building (hideaway)takes up 30 minutes of the\nmovie with no real value being added to the movie with this. <br><br>A villain that is not capable to fight after so much training he had\nuntil now and a girl that can defeat him with a light saber ( even\nthough she had no training). Even a traitor storm trooper can fight a\ntrained Jedi with no prior training (not to mention that he used the\nlight saber and for now has not been revealed as a Jedi or anything of\nthat sort). A mockery i tell you.<br><br>They even destroyed the bad ass image of Han Solo with the last scene\nhe had. That is not the image he had/should have/was build up to until\nnow.<br><br>If it would have been a stand-alone movie i would see this movie at an\n6.2 rating.

Is the First order incapable\nof learning from mistakes, or inventing anything new? Its laughably\nbad. Was it the directors intention to make the First Order look stupid\nand incompetent? They succeeded.<br><br>How is it Rey can pilot the Milennium Falcon with no training. Are the\nlaws of common sense not applicable in this movie? I thought Star Wars\ntried to make everything believable and down-to-earth. Here...not so.<br><br>Why is Han Solo wearing the same thing as 30 years back.

SW 6 ended with\nuniversal peace. 30 years later the \"First Order\" is even bigger than\nthe Empire... I guess they wanted to copy Episode 4 so bad that they\nhad to set the stage this way.<br><br>3) The worst flaw by far though... Rey beating Ren with no\nexperience.... I get it, you advertised this movie so girls would go\nsee it, but don't mess with SW like that. She's new and has to train\nlike everyone else. This was a giant middle finger to SW fans.

The entire movie theater was quiet after the\nmovie was over and it looked like a funeral. This movie was so\npredictable and there were plot holes everywhere. The character\ninteractions felt inauthentic. It's weird how Finn and Poe became best\nfriends instantly. I also didn't like that Rey's character learned how\nto use the force, ride the falcon, and fix random things like an expert\nout of nowhere with no training. I like strong female characters like\nAshoka, but I don't like it when the male characters respond to\neverything cool she does as if it was unexpected; this happens many\ntimes throughout the movie. I also hated the villains. Snoke looked\nlike Voldemort and looked like a giant troll at first with bad cgi. Ren\nstarts off cool and turns into whiny b*** as the movie goes on.

I love star wars and enjoyed episodes 1-6.\nThis movie is so bad that I miss the creativity of Episode 1. Episode 1\nwas weak, but at least it was original.

Yes, the prequels are not great films, but it would be pure\nignorance to pretend that they have not happened, especially if these\nprequels are OFFICIALLY canon of the series.

Kylo Ren lost a light saber fight against a Finn\nthe Janitor and Rey the complete novice. He throws tantrums like a\nteenager. He kills his own father in a totally cowardly way. Was Han\nSolo a terrible parent to raise such a loser? Darth Vader never loses\nhis cool and kills Obi Wan in revenge.<br><br>Young Luke&gt;Old Luke Young Luke defeated and redeemed his father by his\nlove and compassion. Old Luke despaired enough to camp on an island and\nwatch the galaxy burn. Young Luke risked it all to fight Vader to save\nhis friends on Cloud City. Old Luke didn't give a &amp;*^34^!, and camped\non an island and watched the galaxy burn.<br><br>Young Luke&gt;Rey Luke Skywalker in the Original trilogy had flaws. He was\nuntrained, impulsive, naive, and fought Darth Vader and lost his hand.\nHe struggled and grew, and eventually became the hero. Rey was perfect\nfrom the beginning, and defeated Kylo Ren with zero training. She had\nno struggle. The story had no drama.<br><br>Rey already beat Kylo Ren, the Second Strongest Dark Side User in the\nGalaxy TM without breaking a sweat. I'm sure she can go the the First\nOrder HQ and destroy Snoke(that is a terrible name) after fighting\nthrough all the storm troopers. The next movie will be 10 minutes long.<br><br>I'm tired, I think I will go to sleep.\n"},
{"review": "\nBefore I saw the movie, I'd already read some bad reviews. I'm a huge\nSW fan so I decided to go see it. I couldn't believe how poorly made\nthis film was. Acting was mediocre to say the least with the exception\nof the droids and Chewbacca. The old cast trio acted very little in the\nfilm, especially Mark Hamil who appears only a couple of minutes. The\nlight saber fighting scenes were poor and uninspired. I don't want to\ngo into EU, non-canon issues as that's a personal opinion. For me it\nwas a bad mistake not to follow the EU with all the epic material out\nthere. I mean there is material right there, served on a golden\nplatter. The villains were weak as it's usually the case with Disney's\nmovies, all talk but no backbone. To have the main villain, the leader\nof the \"First Order\", be defeated by a girl who never touched a light\nsaber before in her life... that spells disaster in my books. Where is\nthe ominous presence of Darth Vader, Count Dooku, Darth Sidious, Obi\nWan etc.? Where is the epic atmosphere of the previous films? What of\nthis \"Supreme Leader Snoke\"? He looks like Gollum! Where on the galaxy\ndid they find Luke's/Anakin's light saber and stored it in a chest in a\nbasement?? That light saber was cut off Luke's hand and dropped in the\nchasm of Bespin's bottom (probably down in the ocean) in episode V. How\ndid Kylo Ren find Darth Vader's mask? That was burned on the moon of\nEndor some 30 years ago. Finally the story. Ah the story, it seemed to\nme I was watching a remake of Episode IV... come on! Another bigger,\nbadder Death \"Planet\"... No background, no nothing. I really do hope,\nGeorge Lucas buys back the franchise, disavows this film, and makes a\nproper one.<br><br>I give it a 2/10 grade, 1 for the SW logo and 1 for the past films. No\nmore.\n"},

{"review": "\n* contains spoilers * <br><br>In keeping with my expectations JJ Abrams thoroughly disappointed -\nwhich for me is a pyrrhic victory given I really wanted to enjoy this\nmovie. <br><br>First, the story..... if you've seen the first Star Wars, imagine a\nbigger more powerful Death Star and change the leads. I can almost hear\nYoda going \"Sh*t that was Star Trek, you would not protest, so kick in\nthe balls, for Star Wars you will get\".<br><br>Kylo and Han's family reunion moment on the bridge was an Oscar moment,\nit was a duel of epic proportions because both parties are congenitally\nincapable of ACTING - it was a real nail biter watching which of the\ntwo would be worse. In the end .....i think it was a tie. I thought\nKylo was worse (and consequently won) till I saw Hans expression when\nthe saber went through him. Tie it is.<br><br>Rey is as clumsy with a light saber as her (i expect it to be revealed\nin the future) dad Luke was in the first 3 - she seems like she'd\nstruggle to use a broom effectively much less a saber. But she's\ndefinitely Luke's daughter given this obvious genetic clue.<br><br>Oh yes, and while Kylo's entry is almost inspired (he stops a blast\nfrom a ray gun cold in mid air) he quickly devolves into a whiny\npetulant adolescent throwing tantrums all over the place ultimately\ngetting is bum kicked by a girl with no prior (as far as we can see)\nForce training.

{"review": "\nFor those of us who are Star Wars fans but still burdened with a\nfunctioning brain, I expect you will find this latest installment\nincredibly lacking. It is a given that any true fan will see this film;\nhowever, when contemplating ownership and how many times can I watch\nthis very flawed movie, I am certain the answer for myself is\nabsolutely not and perhaps only a few times more from the blessings of\nvideo rentals. I have two major problems with the movie. Stop hear if\nyou wish to avoid spoilers. First, from the moment the latest planet\nkilling monstrosity appears, you know it will be destroyed in some\nimplausible fashion. Any time a story devolves into placid\npredictability, the story begins to hemorrhage. There are also too many\nsignificant plot points that are equally not very surprising, The most\nsignificant being the monstrously telegraphed confrontation between\nSolo and his anti-prodigal son, Jacen. When Solo begins approaching\nhim, I suppressed eye rolling with my supreme force of will and\nthought, \"He's dead.\" The scene lost all gravity in what should have\nbeen a seminal moment. The resulting cry from Chewbacca was obligatory\nand was far less compelling than his anguish on Hoth during the\nundisputed champion of all these films, Empire. Contrast this death\nwith that of Captain Pike during Into Darkness, which was a\nmasterpiece, and the death of Solo, whom I had far more emotional\nattachment to having been a fan since early childhood, feels utterly\nlacking. The second catastrophic flaw was the final duel. I grant that\nKylo Ren was in conflict, but it didn't stay his hand from killing his\nown father moments earlier. If it was meant to be conveyed that Kylo\nwas somehow sparing Finn and Rey, it was the worst lack of\ncommunication from a director to his audience that I have ever\nwitnessed. If they were truly fighting, Finn should have died from\nforce strangulation or from a beheading as Kylo rent Rey to pieces.\n"},
{"review": "\nAnother Disney movie infested with mistimed jokes (had an Avengers\n2feel to it)... Though, I'll admit, I did laugh. It was an enjoyable\nfilm if you just look at the comedic value and the nostalgia it offers.\nLet's get to the gist here now, the movie lacked consistency,\nseriousness, intensity, emotion, and originality. Pilot's friend dies\nand he busts out a joke after getting captured. Death of the best\ncharacter in this episode was brushed off like it was nothing. Plot was\nessentially the 3 original films clumped into 1. Music was 0/10\ncompared to the other 6 films. Main characters were able to defeat the\nvillain with 0 light saber and force training. \"That is not how the\nForce works!\" Well, Disney made it seem like that wasn't the case.\nFinally, we get the same prequel villain we've bashed for years, yet\nsomehow and some way people LOVE this guy! Temper tantrums, no\nintimidation, and he looks like a mix of Nicolas Cage and Severus\nSnape. Honestly, the positive reviews are simply because the movie\nkisses the asses of blinded Star Wars fans.\n"},

Unfortunately, this film\nnever took what motivates a character to behave a certain way seriously\nso there were a lot of senseless behavior and unexplained scenes. It\nwas okay to kill off Han Solo but they could have made his death more\nheroic as befitting the epic tradition of Star Wars.

{"review": "\nI have never before written a movie review, but after watching this\nabomination I felt compelled to spread the truth: THE EMPEROR HAS NO\nCLOTHES!<br><br>Now I understand why Disney bought Lucasfilm and with it the rights to\nStar Wars - they hated its success so much, so that they wanted to\ndestroy it once and for all, but making a lot of money on the way. To\nbe truly efficient they needed to get the sith lord of movie-making\nJ.J. Abrams on their side, whose storytelling talent is that of a log\nin a fireplace. For hours after watching this so-called movie, I\nwondered how the story writing was actually done - did they first start\nwith the plot or with the plot holes. The plot holes in SWTFA are so\nbrilliantly executed, so that hundreds of books and Disney cartoons\n(generating more profits along the way) will be needed to fill in the\ngaps. While I agree that the plot holes made some sense (in terms of\nfuture PROFITS), I cannot say the same about the plot itself - its\ncomplete lack of logic is staggering. The next step in their plan of\nruining SW was even better - they had to create 2-dimensional\nuninteresting characters (no need to mention specific ones since they\nall fit this definition perfectly) that had to be acted very poorly\n(which explains the subconscious desire of Han Solo to die and relieve\nHarrison Ford from carrying on with the role). For the picture to be\ncomplete they had to add cheesy humor and cheap CGI effects - obviously\nsupreme leader Snoke was so powerful, so that he succeeded to escape\nthe LOTR universe and jump right into the SW one. I don't know why John\nWilliams decided to participate in this plan and ruin his own music,\nbut this time he delivered a completely unmemorable score.<br><br>Although my review seems overly critical this move has one redeeming\nvalue, that makes up for all its flaws - now, I consider the prequels\n(SW 1-3) to be true masterpieces of movie-making.\n"},

I\nhave read some critics that list the similarities,so i'll obviate\nthat,but i have to say something about the part when they discuss the\nattack plan: the planet-weapon has the same weakness as the\ndeath-star,the same! I mean,we are not that stupids. Have some respect\nfor the public,for god's sake! Even in the movie they said \"it's\nanother death-star\".<br><br>This was sad. You had a lot of material from the expanded universe to\nmake a great movie,an epic one. Instead,you have done a really bad\ncopy.(Seriously, I have played star wars games with better plot) <br><br>I'll put this film the worst rate possible,because it has ruined maybe\nthe greatest movie saga of all times.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was eager to see the new Star Wars film. I even love the prequels.\nWhen I watched the \"Force Awakens\", I felt that the director\nunderestimates my intelligence. <br><br>The movie has no story whatsoever, the female protagonist is there just\nto please the feminists and I rarely see a movie trying so hard to be\npolitically correct. I mean seriously, with zero training she could use\nJedi mind tricks and beat a guy trained in the Jedi ways. <br><br>I watched a whole Star Wars movie and I don't even feel I explored the\ngalaxy at all. No emotions, no excitement, nothing. Only Disney jokes\nand fast paced nonsense. <br><br>Please give me my money back.\n"}
