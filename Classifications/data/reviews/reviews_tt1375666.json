{"review": "\nI'd like to keep my review rather to the point.<br><br>Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least.\nThere are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. <br><br>2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. <br><br>3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you\nfeel jumpy about it when it does.<br><br>4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to\nanother, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At\ntimes, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. <br><br>5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and\ndigest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I\nbelieve. <br><br>6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least\ntries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions,\nsome of which are very familiar with and dear to us.<br><br>Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was\nconvincing enough there was not enough of character development. I\nwonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s)\nafter watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional\nstruggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you\nask me. <br><br>2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters\nthan necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed\nmore of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more\nfocused. <br><br>3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things\nabout dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie.\nI'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. <br><br>In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without\nroom for improvement. <br><br>I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks,\nif you dig this kind of flicks. <br><br>Cheers!\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created\nsomething with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which\nwill blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the\nmovie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in\nLondon and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored\nmaximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it\ndeserve all this?<br><br>Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of\nvarious business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs\nforcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly\nhaunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has\na nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on\nhis missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he\nhad lost his love!<br><br>But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken\nWatanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his\nbusiness rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his\njob was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'<br><br>Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out\nthe the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him,\nArthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy\n(Eames), a \"forger\" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao),\na powerful sedative supplier. <br><br>There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs\nand the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch\nthe scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride.\nThe action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is\nelectronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will\nget a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.<br><br>Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in\nTitanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered\nforever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will\nbe his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an\nextraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work\nis nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in\nthe 'Best Director' category. If \"Inception\" is a metaphysical puzzle,\nit's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between\nCobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us,\nmess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.<br><br>To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a\nfavor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by\nNolan! <br><br>My Rating: 10/10<br><br>Thanks &amp; Regards\n"},
{"review": "\nUsually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the\nexpectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for\nChristopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.<br><br>This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is\nabsolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely\nrefreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack\nfor making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I\nfor one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that\nhere. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together\nbut is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. <br><br>I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick\ndoing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be\ncalled that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not\nthink Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure\ngreatness.<br><br>I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really\ndifficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am\nsure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something\nabout it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut,\nmeans that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals\nare interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.<br><br>The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated\naction sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying\nattention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without\nspoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is\nabout, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have\nseen this you will now what I am talking about.<br><br>All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here.\nYes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of\nthe emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his\nperformance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a\ngreat performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here,\nhe is quite the bad ass.<br><br>I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven\nfilm which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would\nhope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the\ndirectors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like\nDistrict 9, yet I do not think it will. <br><br>I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say\neveryone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is\njust so hard not too.<br><br>If you liked this review check out my new film blog:\nhttp://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com\n"},

My Grade won't change-it's the same\nfor all Nolan movies-sheer 10!\n"},

The best part about it is that while you may feel you need\nto watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances\nare, you will probably want to.<br><br>Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help\nof a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The\nDeparted), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page\n(Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman\nBegins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing\nphotography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling\nmusic in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was\nalso set the mood for Nolan's previous film, The Dark Knight.<br><br>While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely\ncomplex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind.\nTechnical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together\nas beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement\neach other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both\nheart- wrenching and heart-pounding.

{"review": "\nInception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in\nChristopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale\nsensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true\noriginal in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.<br><br>To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly\nintelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been\nreluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open\nmind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then\ntrust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology\n(although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then\nInception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running\ntime, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't\nexpect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film\nabout how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every\nsingle part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect\nof the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry.\nThey are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and\nunbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action\nset pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story,\nrather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.<br><br>With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed.\nAnd Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio,\nperhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as\nhis role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to\nbe the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's\nemotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all\nshine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually\nnon-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his\nconfidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish\nas the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big\nfemale star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film\ncompared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.<br><br>Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as\nexpansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and\none which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This\nis truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a\nwhole two years before Batman 3.\n"},

It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot\nand not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in\nthe end.<br><br>Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the\nfinishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing\nInception, definitely go!

Since\nthen, Nolan has gained huge popularity with his revival of the Batman\nfranchise, and even more so with the stunning Dark Knight - that still\nhas yet to relinquish its grip on modern day cinema - with the genius\nof The Prestige sandwiched in between.<br><br>None of this, however, could have quite prepared us for the spectacle\nthat is INCEPTION.

With this and Shutter Island,\nnow must be the time for his first Oscar - he has asserted his place as\ntruly one of the best actors currently working. All reviews will\nconfirm that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and Ellen Page back his\nperformance up superbly with well-worked turns. Inception's action\nsequences play out wonderfully, being - along with the comic relief and\nback-stories - an integral part of the film's unravelling, whilst we\nremain rooted to the film's emotional stakes, which give immense\npurpose to the film's complex and layered narrative.<br><br>Our protagonist battles with both outer and inner demons in his quest\nfor redemption.

I am sure most\nof the audience didn't get what the movie was about but they pretended\nso they would not look stupid.

The point was not to entertain\naudience but rather it was a show-off of what artistic capability the\ndirector/writer possesses. It tried to point out the fact what a movie\ngenius Christopher Nolan is. I mean I love this guy. The Prestige was\ngreat and so was the Dark Knight.

I have at least 6 arguments:<br><br>1. The characters are just silhouettes, transparent and shallow. There\nis no psychological deepness; the protagonists are emotionless objects\nmoved from place to place like chess figures. They don't have any soul.\nBut what marked a movie is his developing of characters.

And the end! What\na big disaster: it's like in a video game, in an ego-shooter. It's so\nstupid. Almost propaganda for war.<br><br>4. Then, Nolan will make this movie \"intelligent and complex\". Do you\nknow M. Nolan that intellectual and deep does not mean emotionless and\na confusing plot? <br><br>5. Nolans idea to enter in the dream of somebody else is not so bad but\nthe idea is not exhausted. Dreams are imagination, there are no rules,\nand they are bizarre and strange (Have you ever seen a film by David\nLynch Mr. Nolan? That is like a dream.). So what all the guys with guns\nare doing there? Why are there always skyscrapers or a military base?\nThat's stupid. There is NO IMAGINATION, your dreams are copies of real\nlife and they are even WORSE than reality. The only good thing is the\nsequence with the train.<br><br>6.

Dumb! Dumb! Come ON!\nSurely that must be enough DUMS! for you to realise that you're\nwitnessing a tour de force from a director at the pinnacle of his\ngenius? It's a film of transcendent majesty! A mind blowing spectacle\nutterly thrilling to the senses and deeply fulfilling to the intellect!\nAnd if you're not convinced of this, I can do what Christopher Nolan\ndoes, and just keep going Dumb! Dumb!

The enemy characters\nfrequently fire bursts of rounds but never manage to hit anyone despite\nample opportunities. How many times does Nolan think it's a great idea\nto show a character floating around in a hotel corridor while fighting\n'projections'? And someone please tell him that he can't prove to the\nworld he's made the best film ever by going Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! over and\nover again. Except apparently he can.<br><br>The basic idea has the potential to make the stunning film so many\npeople think it is, but Nolan wastes the opportunity with a dull\nstoryline. Getting a business man to split up his company? Is that the\nmost exciting thing he could think of? Couldn't he get a president to\ndecide to launch a nuclear attack or something? Did it have to be\nsomething so mundane?

As the climax boils (in an extremely\nprosaic dreamworld hardly worth the effort and CGI) on three different\nlevels - one a minibus falling off a bridge (interminably in slow\nmotion), the second Tom Hardy's screen test for the remake of 'On Her\nMajesty's Secret Service' complete with ski shooters, Blofeld's alpine\nfortress, and an enemy that cannot kill a hero from five yards!, and\nthe third, a legoland where Di Caprio's wife is skulking siren-like to\nlure him to stay forever - the film really creaks and shows its'\npaucity of vision, script, characters, and downright boringness! I have\nto excuse some of it because I needed the loo and could not get out of\nmy row! Yes, I had a totem which kept me firmly in reality ( I knew how\nlong we had to go by how far the minibus had to fall!).<br><br>And the plot holes - many, but the worst involved the Cillian Murphy\ngetting killed in the second level which should have left him in\nmindless limbo on level 3, but he was dead there as well, while Ken\nWatanabe who died in level 2, became a very old man in level 3!!!! And\nright at the end, Cillian Murphy has been trained to resist dream\nthieves, and when he wakes up, he finds himself in the cabin with the\ngang but does not put two and two together and realise they are the\nreal thieves having persuaded him in his dream otherwise!! Gettit?\nDon't bother, it was probably all Di Caprio's dream anyway - a load of\nold tosh that has Nolan laughing all the way to the bank, and many\nso-called serious critics facing the sack for lavishly overpraising a\npiece of mediocre tosh!!!\n"},

{"review": "\nAfter reading a few of the reviews on this site, we decided to watch\n\"Inception\", and we went with great expectations. Unfortunately, the\nmovie was a big disappointment.<br><br>The impression \"Inception\" leaves is that the director tried to squeeze\nas much action as possible into one movie, and it seems that it was\ntherefore that the story was split into reality and four additional\n\"unreal\" dreamworlds which are displayed almost simultaneously. There\nis hardcore-action with aggressive special effects, fighting, killing,\nexcessive shooting, explosions, car-chases, snowmobile-chases and the\nliking in every layer, and the permanent hopping from one layer to\nanother makes this a non-stop-action-flick while the story behind all\nthis seems to take a back seat.<br><br>If one likes action and special effects, the movie might be interesting\n- the storytelling is poor. The plot and the technology involved are so\ncomplicated that, after a while, one gets indifferent. There is almost\nno identification with the main characters. In this movie, almost\nanything can happen, and the audience will accept it because it can't\nfollow the story. Like this, no suspension can be built, and over two\nhours full of action without suspense and bad storytelling can be\nrather tiring.<br><br>The story itself is not very clever. The setup reminds of the \"Matrix\"\n- the old question of what is really real. However, the idea of an\npowerful Asian industrial boss who hires a crew to secretly invade his\ncompetitor's brain in order to increase his own profit (and who\ndeliberately risks his own life during the operation) is very far\nfetched. He could just as well shoot all of his competitors, because\naccording to the story, the Asian boss is so powerful that he does not\nhave to fear any governmental action. So, why invading brains, risking\nthe own life and the life of others instead of just getting rid of the\ntrouble by shooting it? Then, there is a weird aspect about the\ndreaming itself. I can imagine that everything happens inside my own\ndream, but to have many people dream the same dream simultaneously\nbecause they are plugged to a special device... I don't know. I am not\nsomeone who screams for logic in movies, but this was hard to take.<br><br>This movie is just an action movie disguised as clever science-fiction\nwhich it is absolutely not.

There\nis, of course, real ingenuity in some of the action scenes especially\nthose place in a zero gravity situation. Nolan was simply lucky in\nhaving an action movie released during a time when there wasn't really\nmuch competition and audiences were clearly hungry for something\nbetter. Nolan was even luckier having Hans Zimmer for Mr. Zimmer keeps\nsuspense alive during the many long scenes of exposition. The real\ntheatrical breakthrough lies in the film's using the telling part\n(hugely aided by Hans' music) to sustain interest and some suspense\nwhich are then fulfilled in the showing part. It is quite amazing that\nthe film did so well at the BO; there are really no characters to\nsympathize with or to particularly care about.

There is no\nspark, no chemistry, thus you can't really understand why Leonardo\nwould consider staying in a dreamworld just to be together with his old\nflame that he doesn't seem to have any affection for when she was\nalive.<br><br>3. The Alibi cutie. If you eliminate Allen Page from the script, no-one\nwould spot the difference. Honestly folks, if the architect of a dream\nlandscape is so important and the wrong fabric of a bathmat can thwart\nthe success of a mission, why don't we get any insight of how this\nwhizz kid designs those dreamscapes and what makes her so\nindispensable. If we had any inkling what exactly she was doing there\napart from looking pretty she would have been far less annoying.<br><br>4. The aforementioned holes in the plot. Too numerous to mention here,\njust think about this: if someone who has a dream in a dream and in the\nfirst dream he sits in a van that drops down a bridge, there is no\nlogical way he would be weightless in the second dream cause physically\nhe doesn't sit in the van and mentally he doesn't know about the\nmoments without gravity. Dreams just don't work like that and it is an\ninsult to peoples intelligence to suggest that they do.<br><br>But if all that was not enough, there is so much more inconsistency\nhere, like for instance, why would a tycoon who has the money to buy up\nentire airlines and the power to overrule the judicial system in\nAmerica be so utterly afraid of some healthy competition that he risks\nbeing lost in his dreamworld for more than thirty years? <br><br>I think 'good clean fun-loving popcorn movie' is just an euphemism for\nbrainless mainstream crap from America but what is even worse is\nbrainless mainstream crap that claims to be sophisticated. This film\ncertainly is not.\n"},

I\nwonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s)\nafter watching the movie.

The challenge for me was to stay awake whilst the plot\nstumbles from one hole to the next:<br><br>How do they get connected so that can dream the same dream? Chemically,\nphysically?? How can they transport their conscious plans into their\nunconscious dreams and execute them there?

But they commit suicide and that wakes them up instead of\nsending them to Limbo, as we are later told in the movie should be the\ncase when that kind of drug is used. As another example, the lack of\ngravity is felt in the first level of dream, but not in the second\nlevel when the van is falling off.\n"},

At\ntimes promising, rather inventive and satisfying storyteller (Memento,\nInsomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige), but his recent endeavors suffer\nfrom lack of emotional resonance or thematic hollowness (The Dark\nKnight, Inception, The Dark Knight Rises).<br><br>\"Inception\" allegedly had to deal with the nature of dreams and a\nviewer once again discovers to never trust a Hollywod filmmaker. In the\nmovie dreams are not a visual manifestation of one's desires, passions\nand fears, here they're just a game, a hollow \"universe of\npossibilities\".

Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book\n\"The Power of Movies\", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal\ndiscontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then\nleap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan\ntreats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something.\nWhat he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams,\nthe tremendous emotional wallop. \"Inception\" is so detailed, so\nmeasured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the\nimagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with\ncarefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all\nkind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware\nof itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural\nhistorians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big\nCorporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually\nempty films like this (and \"Dark Knight\") as good examples of what\nruined the country.

I fail to understand how this over-blown, over-hyped\nfilm could garner such high ratings unless the people doing the rating\nhave never seen a movie over 20 ears old. The concept was high-minded\nbut the execution was pure popcorn-munching tripe. While I'll admit the\ncinematography was gorgeous and the acting was fairly well done, it was\njust so empty. As others have pointed out, when it's all just a dream,\nthere's not a lot of tension when faceless people are shooting at you.\nJust plain silly, I say. (as an aside, South Park did a very funny\ndream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream years ago!)\n"},

{"review": "\nIt was a pretty good movie, however, when I am able to predict the\ntwists and turns that are going to be taken - and in the first 15\nminutes of watching the movie - the movie automatically gets a lower\nscore with me. I cannot count how many of these movies are being made,\nand most of them are using the same repetitive path - what you think is\nreality isn't - the one who's in charge - or 'In the know' is the one\nwho's psycho, schizophrenic, or mentally unstable. I was surprised that\nafter Leo did Shutter Island, that he'd just turn around and do the\nsame kind of movie. (For those who didn't notice - the top kept\nspinning in the end shot - meaning he was dreaming - not actually awake\n- which means he was the one all along who was in err). The acting was\na bit over the top and not convincing enough. The script wasn't that\ngreat, and I already can visualize certain types of people making\nattempts to practice this sort of thing. Among those 'certain types'\nyou will also find hoards of conversations about 'lucid dreaming' and\n'out of body experience', huge attractions to witchcraft, Harry Potter,\netc, 'reality' shows, trash TV, RPG's and other games - basically - a\nlot of fantasy and unreality type of attractions. This movie will be a\ncult classic to them, maybe even their bible. The good thing about this\nmovie does indeed need to be noted, however. We are living in an\nunreality &amp; fantasy based society and it's ever growing. This movie\nshows the dangers of living in in that kind of mode, where a person\nstarts getting more and more confused about what is real and what\nisn't. I ended up fast forwarding through quite a bit. It's getting a\ntotal score of 9??? Up for awards??? Com'on people. There's no logic\nwhy this movie is getting these kind of ratings.\n"},

I\nwonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s)\nafter watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional\nstruggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you\nask me. <br><br>2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters\nthan necessary.

The movie unmasks itself as a very uninspired\nconvoluted pseudo something when the protagonists have to find an\nalternative dream-tactic because their target protects himself. What\nthey consider to be a new psychological trick is so plain and\nunoriginal that becomes clear with a 'kick' that Nolan was absolutely\nunaware of any scientific profound background by developing the plot.\nThe plot within a plot within a plot is not automatically an\n\"intellectual\" challenging procedure when one plot is the exact mirror\nof the other. The challenge for me was to stay awake whilst the plot\nstumbles from one hole to the next:<br><br>How do they get connected so that can dream the same dream? Chemically,\nphysically?? How can they transport their conscious plans into their\nunconscious dreams and execute them there? Etc., Etc.<br><br>I can't help it, but Nolan is one of the few directors in Hollywood who\ncan direct any script as tedious as you can imagine. There are so many\nmoments in that movie where i thought Wow, that could have been much\nmore suspenseful if, for instance, Cameron or so had directed it.<br><br>This movie is stupid. You can make a stupid plot 'intelligent' by\nnesting it multiple times, it just multiplies its stupidity. In this\nsense the next Nolan movie could be a even greater \"masterpiece\" for\nmeat heads: when it has a dump base plot every fool can follow, but\nthis time the plot is the plot in the plot in the plot in the plot in\nthe.....that's challenging isn't it?\n"},

{"review": "\nOne can't say that Christopher Nolan is not an ambitious director. Too\nbad that the bigger movie he makes the more superficial it becomes. At\ntimes promising, rather inventive and satisfying storyteller (Memento,\nInsomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige), but his recent endeavors suffer\nfrom lack of emotional resonance or thematic hollowness (The Dark\nKnight, Inception, The Dark Knight Rises).<br><br>\"Inception\" allegedly had to deal with the nature of dreams and a\nviewer once again discovers to never trust a Hollywod filmmaker. In the\nmovie dreams are not a visual manifestation of one's desires, passions\nand fears, here they're just a game, a hollow \"universe of\npossibilities\". You go from one level to another to do or simply get\nsomething. Nothing more than that. This is an example of \"starting with\na big idea and ending with unsatisfying results\", which this movie\nfollows precisely.<br><br>Build on rinsed concept of dreams, \"Inception\" offers its audience:\ncharacters who literally \"speak plot\" (Michael Caine, Tom Hardy and\nCillian Murphy give the only good performances here, which says more\nthan enough, what amount of talent is needed to revive Nolan's\ncharacters), always interesting design by Guy Hendrix Dyas, intriguing\nand sometimes beautiful lighting by Wally Pfister and editing which at\ntimes made me think \"what's going on?\" (especially during a battle\nunder the fortress).<br><br>Because of the high concentration on plot, it's a hard experience to\nwatch \"Inception\" again. It's boring because everything that counts is\njust told and you've heard it all before. You also won't find much to\nlook in the frame and this is the point when Nolan fails as a\nfilmmaker. He is not interested in creating a multidimensional reality. <br><br>If you can't re-watch a picture, that means it's not really\ninteresting.\n"},

In fact, I had\nforgotten about it until last night. One of the things I remember was\nhow poorly Ellen Page's character was rounded out. I remember laughing,\nnot at her - but at the part she had to play, Ms. Exposition. Explain\neverything to her, so the audience knows what is going on. The action\nwas clich\u00e9, and left me wanting more. The whole thing about going into\nsomeone's dream is so silly, but not funny silly - which leads me to...<br><br>South Park, on the other hand. Was a lot more fun. Throw in a Sheep\nHerder, a young Mr. Mackey, a random pizza delivery guy, and even a\nretired Freddy Kruger and you've got an entertaining 22 minutes.

Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book\n\"The Power of Movies\", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal\ndiscontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then\nleap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan\ntreats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something.\nWhat he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams,\nthe tremendous emotional wallop. \"Inception\" is so detailed, so\nmeasured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the\nimagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with\ncarefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all\nkind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware\nof itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural\nhistorians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big\nCorporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually\nempty films like this (and \"Dark Knight\") as good examples of what\nruined the country.

{"review": "\nIt was a pretty good movie, however, when I am able to predict the\ntwists and turns that are going to be taken - and in the first 15\nminutes of watching the movie - the movie automatically gets a lower\nscore with me. I cannot count how many of these movies are being made,\nand most of them are using the same repetitive path - what you think is\nreality isn't - the one who's in charge - or 'In the know' is the one\nwho's psycho, schizophrenic, or mentally unstable. I was surprised that\nafter Leo did Shutter Island, that he'd just turn around and do the\nsame kind of movie. (For those who didn't notice - the top kept\nspinning in the end shot - meaning he was dreaming - not actually awake\n- which means he was the one all along who was in err). The acting was\na bit over the top and not convincing enough. The script wasn't that\ngreat, and I already can visualize certain types of people making\nattempts to practice this sort of thing. Among those 'certain types'\nyou will also find hoards of conversations about 'lucid dreaming' and\n'out of body experience', huge attractions to witchcraft, Harry Potter,\netc, 'reality' shows, trash TV, RPG's and other games - basically - a\nlot of fantasy and unreality type of attractions. This movie will be a\ncult classic to them, maybe even their bible. The good thing about this\nmovie does indeed need to be noted, however. We are living in an\nunreality &amp; fantasy based society and it's ever growing. This movie\nshows the dangers of living in in that kind of mode, where a person\nstarts getting more and more confused about what is real and what\nisn't. I ended up fast forwarding through quite a bit. It's getting a\ntotal score of 9??? Up for awards??? Com'on people. There's no logic\nwhy this movie is getting these kind of ratings.\n"},

But whew, Inception... wow what a stinker.<br><br>There's no question that this production staff and the cast took this\nproject and themselves very seriously. It oozes production values. Too\nbad it lost me in the first 10 minute when I had no idea what was\nhappening. And not in a good way, like other thrillers. I had\nabsolutely no desire to understand the clap-trap these unlikeable\ncharacters were spouting. The kid from Third Rock, wow he thinks he's\nquite the bad boy. Fail.<br><br>Anyway, instead of something that held my interest, this movie simply\nfrustrated me. Inception is a ponderous, self-important, vacuous movie.\nIt's empty, all presentation, no flavor. It makes no sense and I didn't\neven want to keep straining to figure it out. It doesn't unfold like\n\"The Game\" where you're dying to know how it comes out, clue by clue. I\neven stuck with Shutter Island and didn't really like that one, but it\nwas way, way, way better than this movie. And it's not because I don't\nhave patience for high-concept. It's not ambiguous or thought-provoking\nit just ends.<br><br>Still, I would recommend others see this film and judge for themselves.\nOthers seem to find this movie very intense and deep. I just don't get\nit. Personal preference, but there are quite a few like me where\nmetaphysical pseudo sci-fi speeches, and lots of rules about what you\ncan and can't do are just frustrating and not a nice evening's\nentertainment. I think I'll go watch The Game or Matrix again. It's\nbeen a while and I need to get the sour taste of this movie out of my\nmouth.\n"},

I\nwonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s)\nafter watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional\nstruggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you\nask me. <br><br>2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters\nthan necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed\nmore of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more\nfocused. <br><br>3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things\nabout dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie.\nI'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. <br><br>In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without\nroom for improvement. <br><br>I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks,\nif you dig this kind of flicks. <br><br>Cheers!\n"},

The plot didn't really\nstart to make any sense until about halfway through (far too late) and\nLeonardo di Caprio as the central character, Cobb, was competent but\njust didn't have the charisma to carry this kind of story. His wife's\ndeath was foreshadowed a lot in the early part of the film and I found\nI just didn't care how or why she died. None of the other characters\ncame across as real people and their connection to Cobb was generally\nunclear to me. The impression was of good actors (like Tom Hardy) being\nbasically wasted.<br><br>I almost switched off the film after the first twenty minutes because\nits chaotic action seemed designed almost to alienate the viewer. It\nstarted to make some sense after that, but was still a long way from\nwhat a good film should be. The over-reliance on sudden loud noises\n(way above the level of the dialogue) in the first half was simply\nirritating.<br><br>The film also seemed to have trouble obeying its own internal logic.\nSeveral reviewers have mentioned that there was no consistency in what\nis supposed to happen when a dreamer dies during a dream; I was\nunimpressed by the 'projections' in the dreams apparently having their\nown personalities and being capable of independent thought, although\nthe script also had them as nothing more than figments of the dreamer's\nimagination.<br><br>Yes, the film's settings and special effects were impressive, but\nthat's really not what an evening out (or in) should be about.

{"review": "\nOne can't say that Christopher Nolan is not an ambitious director. Too\nbad that the bigger movie he makes the more superficial it becomes. At\ntimes promising, rather inventive and satisfying storyteller (Memento,\nInsomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige), but his recent endeavors suffer\nfrom lack of emotional resonance or thematic hollowness (The Dark\nKnight, Inception, The Dark Knight Rises).<br><br>\"Inception\" allegedly had to deal with the nature of dreams and a\nviewer once again discovers to never trust a Hollywod filmmaker. In the\nmovie dreams are not a visual manifestation of one's desires, passions\nand fears, here they're just a game, a hollow \"universe of\npossibilities\". You go from one level to another to do or simply get\nsomething. Nothing more than that. This is an example of \"starting with\na big idea and ending with unsatisfying results\", which this movie\nfollows precisely.<br><br>Build on rinsed concept of dreams, \"Inception\" offers its audience:\ncharacters who literally \"speak plot\" (Michael Caine, Tom Hardy and\nCillian Murphy give the only good performances here, which says more\nthan enough, what amount of talent is needed to revive Nolan's\ncharacters), always interesting design by Guy Hendrix Dyas, intriguing\nand sometimes beautiful lighting by Wally Pfister and editing which at\ntimes made me think \"what's going on?\" (especially during a battle\nunder the fortress).<br><br>Because of the high concentration on plot, it's a hard experience to\nwatch \"Inception\" again. It's boring because everything that counts is\njust told and you've heard it all before. You also won't find much to\nlook in the frame and this is the point when Nolan fails as a\nfilmmaker. He is not interested in creating a multidimensional reality. <br><br>If you can't re-watch a picture, that means it's not really\ninteresting.\n"},

In fact, I had\nforgotten about it until last night. One of the things I remember was\nhow poorly Ellen Page's character was rounded out. I remember laughing,\nnot at her - but at the part she had to play, Ms. Exposition. Explain\neverything to her, so the audience knows what is going on. The action\nwas clich\u00e9, and left me wanting more. The whole thing about going into\nsomeone's dream is so silly, but not funny silly - which leads me to...<br><br>South Park, on the other hand. Was a lot more fun. Throw in a Sheep\nHerder, a young Mr. Mackey, a random pizza delivery guy, and even a\nretired Freddy Kruger and you've got an entertaining 22 minutes.

Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book\n\"The Power of Movies\", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal\ndiscontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then\nleap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan\ntreats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something.\nWhat he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams,\nthe tremendous emotional wallop. \"Inception\" is so detailed, so\nmeasured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the\nimagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with\ncarefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all\nkind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware\nof itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural\nhistorians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big\nCorporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually\nempty films like this (and \"Dark Knight\") as good examples of what\nruined the country.

I was surprised that\nafter Leo did Shutter Island, that he'd just turn around and do the\nsame kind of movie. (For those who didn't notice - the top kept\nspinning in the end shot - meaning he was dreaming - not actually awake\n- which means he was the one all along who was in err). The acting was\na bit over the top and not convincing enough. The script wasn't that\ngreat, and I already can visualize certain types of people making\nattempts to practice this sort of thing. Among those 'certain types'\nyou will also find hoards of conversations about 'lucid dreaming' and\n'out of body experience', huge attractions to witchcraft, Harry Potter,\netc, 'reality' shows, trash TV, RPG's and other games - basically - a\nlot of fantasy and unreality type of attractions. This movie will be a\ncult classic to them, maybe even their bible. The good thing about this\nmovie does indeed need to be noted, however. We are living in an\nunreality &amp; fantasy based society and it's ever growing. This movie\nshows the dangers of living in in that kind of mode, where a person\nstarts getting more and more confused about what is real and what\nisn't. I ended up fast forwarding through quite a bit. It's getting a\ntotal score of 9??? Up for awards??? Com'on people. There's no logic\nwhy this movie is getting these kind of ratings.\n"},
{"review": "\nInception is right up my alley. I was expecting a thinking person's\nthriller with a bit of sci fi. C Nolan is well known - I loved the Dark\nKnight and Batman Begins. He's quality and tells a slow boiling story\nthat pays off a concept. But whew, Inception... wow what a stinker.<br><br>There's no question that this production staff and the cast took this\nproject and themselves very seriously. It oozes production values. Too\nbad it lost me in the first 10 minute when I had no idea what was\nhappening. And not in a good way, like other thrillers. I had\nabsolutely no desire to understand the clap-trap these unlikeable\ncharacters were spouting. The kid from Third Rock, wow he thinks he's\nquite the bad boy. Fail.<br><br>Anyway, instead of something that held my interest, this movie simply\nfrustrated me. Inception is a ponderous, self-important, vacuous movie.\nIt's empty, all presentation, no flavor. It makes no sense and I didn't\neven want to keep straining to figure it out. It doesn't unfold like\n\"The Game\" where you're dying to know how it comes out, clue by clue. I\neven stuck with Shutter Island and didn't really like that one, but it\nwas way, way, way better than this movie. And it's not because I don't\nhave patience for high-concept. It's not ambiguous or thought-provoking\nit just ends.<br><br>Still, I would recommend others see this film and judge for themselves.\nOthers seem to find this movie very intense and deep. I just don't get\nit. Personal preference, but there are quite a few like me where\nmetaphysical pseudo sci-fi speeches, and lots of rules about what you\ncan and can't do are just frustrating and not a nice evening's\nentertainment. I think I'll go watch The Game or Matrix again. It's\nbeen a while and I need to get the sour taste of this movie out of my\nmouth.\n"}
