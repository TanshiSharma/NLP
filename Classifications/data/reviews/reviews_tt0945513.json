{"review": "\nI was very fortunate to be at the World Premiere at SXSW in Austin and\nattended the Q&amp;A after with James Duncan, Vera Farmiga, Michelle\nMonaghan, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ben Ripley. The story line keeps you on\nthe edge of your seat and adds in enough humor to make it a thoroughly\nenjoyable experience. There is amazing, subtle chemistry between Jake\nand Michelle which really is the star of the film, performances by all\nthe actors are excellent. Beautiful cinematography that will make\nChicago proud. The ending brings up more questions than answers, but it\nfeels right, so that's OK with me. I am not a big sci-fi fan, but this\nfilm delivers on romance, suspense, mystery and thrills. Highly\nrecommended.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat a movie. The price is worth paying. This movie gets straight to\nthe point. You know you see a lot of movies that waste so much time\ngetting into a story. Not this film, virtually from the off, we are\nthere, in the film. It's like there is no beginning, but a middle and\nan end. Obviously you guys know the storyline so I'll not waste time\ntelling you what it is about, just go and see it. It is a film that\nkeeps you looking, you actually feel like you are 'in the source code'\nwhich is fantastic. The only downside to this film is that it feels\nshort, it was 93 minutes but it simply flies by. Maybe that is a good\nthing? Shows how good this film was!<br><br>GO CHECK IT OUT!\n"},
{"review": "\nSource code is one of those few action/sci-Fi movies that work\neffectively without exaggeration or embellishment. When we see Source\nCode we see the certain resemblance it has with ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'' with Denzel\nWashington but Duncan Jones, with his own talent his own style prevent\nthat from happening. Source Code has is own method and approach, which\nis quite entertaining and enjoyable. This movie is certainly\nrecommended for all the action-junkies because this has all to be a\n''Summer Hit'' which confuses me, why hasn't this opened in June or\nJuly, it had the potential and the content of an ''Summer''\nblockbuster. Jake Gyllenhaal is not your typical action hero, since but\nhe really pulls everything off really well. Michelle Monaghan and Vera\nFarmiga are both absolutely gorgeous women with talent. On the whole\nSource Code is pure entertainment at its best.\n"},

{"review": "\nI can't believe just how bad the movie was. It's totally worthless at\nboth its \"action\" and at its \"meaning\" level. It's not just that the\nplot's ideas are far-fetched. They're not even consistent or logical.<br><br>E.g. how could it be possible to construct a whole parallel world from\njust memories of a handful of people? At some point we learn that \"some\npart\" of the main character's brain is \"still functioning\". It would be\nabsolutely impossible to undertake the complex cognitive tasks he does\nwith just \"some part\" of his brain. Etc, etc. <br><br>As for the \"meaning\", what was it supposed to be? That we should learn\nto care about every moment of our lives? That there exist worlds\nparallel to ours? That we should love our neighbors? Whatever it was,\nit's an utter clich\u00e9. It's hard to believe someone in Hollywood\naccepted this script. Obviously they consider viewers idiots. I hope\nthey are not right.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe idea is nice, it begins very mysteriously and when the general\nconcept is presented you sense there are going to be mind blowing\nthings, something like Inception perhaps. Sadly, the scientific idea is\npurely presented and the writers give too much place to romance, it\nseems like the movie tries to attract women and do so by weakening the\nsci-fi part. I hate movies that try too grab too many aspects, the\nmovie could go a little bit longer and actually build the idea of\n\"Source Code\". The romance is forced upon the story, like the writers\nwere told they had to insert love and did it wrong. To sum it up, a\ngreat concept not so greatly presented. See if you want to satisfy your\nthrill hunger.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe hole technology on which movie's story is based was conflicting\nwith the story itself so badly that it ruined the movie (even for a\nsci-fi lover as myself).

If\nthe movie would end 10 minutes earlier, I would put much better vote.\nBut now the movie could be rated good only if you didn't understand the\nhole concept then comes \"wow - how nice...\", but if you follow the\nstory and have logical thinking - you'll be very disappointed. The\nacting wasn't so bad as many reviewers said, the hole story was a bit\nbanal and in such case you can't act neither brilliant neither bad.\n"},
{"review": "\nI like sci-fi but sorry this is far-fetched crap. The premise is\nutterly absurd. The whole concept and story is like swiss cheese, full\nof holes.

This movie is also laced with the\nfollowing recurring messages we are bombarded with daily:<br><br>The government loves you and wants to save you from any harm. Any who\nquestion the government are \"anti-government\" terrorists. Now clean cut\nboy next door looking white guys are the terrorists. The government\nalways does the right thing in the end. <br><br>Condensed version of review:<br><br>To be fair, the acting and execution are excellent.

{"review": "\nA young man is caught in limbo (= in religions the state between death\nand rebirth) and used for the war against terrorism. Now, the prospect\nof somebody caught in limbo or something similar was used in \"dark\nstar\" by John Carpenter and that film showed what could be done with\nsuch a concept. This film however, is a totally different matter. Even\nbeyond death this poor soul is haunted by lackeys with the gibberish\n\"war on terror\" -bs. Nowhere it is pronounced that only the most\npowerful nation on earth could be said to engage in any terror. Of\ncourse not, because this is by no means a \"leftist\" film and instead a\nfilm for idiots. Vance Packard once wrote that the American society\ndefended the right of the businessman to seek out the morons and make\nthem still more moronic. This film seems to work along these lines.

How can he see other people and places the\noriginal guy didn't even view?? And as for parallel time lines, give me\na break, you can't possibly rationalize that...

{"review": "\nI would never say Source Code is a bad movie, but there are simply way\ntoo many gushing reviews - from critics and viewers alike - than this\nfilm warrants. That the film is a highly suspenseful thriller cannot be\nargued. I quite enjoyed the main character's recurring trips inside the\nsource code scenario. The problem is that the central premise of Source\nCode is implausible at best and quite possibly ludicrous. It's as if\nthe filmmakers felt that if they peel away the layers of plausibility\nvery slowly, the audience won't notice. It does seem like many viewers\neither didn't notice or didn't mind the holes. I'm willing to entertain\nthe occasional logical stretch, but when it is the film's central\npremise being stretched beyond recognition, that's when I begin to have\na problem. As much as I wanted to go along for the ride, I just\ncouldn't go all the way. By the end, the cumulative effect of all the\nliberties taken by the filmmakers became enough to bump Source Code\nfrom out of the sci-fi genre and into the fantasy world.\n"},
{"review": "\nSource Code has a good idea and perhaps if it was done just slightly\ndifferently, it might have worked. Jake Gyllenhaal makes a solid\nleading man and the premise is pretty interesting. But roughly a third\ninto the movie a plot twist is revealed that pretty much nullifies the\nentire premise. All the tension goes out of the movie, because none of\nit matters from this point onwards.<br><br>Gyllenhaal's character reacts somewhat erratically to the situation at\nhand, but you can't really blame him. But yet again the twist gives no\nreal reason to invest yourself in this character. At that point you are\nleft with the other side to the story. It's not really possible to\ndivulge more without venturing into spoilers, but there is not enough\nto really, well, care. An alternative take does emerge in the end and\nis used to conclude the movie, but not enough of the script gave this\nenough attention to hold any merit as a hook.<br><br>Otherwise this is a reasonably good thriller. If you can find suspense\nin the inevitable, then you might still get something out of this.\n"},
{"review": "\nNot sure what other people are seeing in this. Within 10 minutes I had\nthe plot worked out. I very much disliked the cinematography. From the\nfirst scene with the cut aerial shots sweeping to the train and over\nthe city I did not like it. The relationship between the girl on the\ntrain and the man was ridiculous. He had more on screen time and a\nbetter relationship with the military girl. I just thought it was not\nvery good, boring shots very like good TV, very little drama. I do not\nunderstand the people on the edge of there seats comments. A 6 film,\nnot awful but it felt like payola to me. The studio must be delighted\nto have somehow gotten away with it.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had heard a couple of very good reviews of Source Code, but must\nconfess to being slightly disappointed with it myself.<br><br>Source Code tells the story of a Colter Stevens who is placed onto a\ntrain that is about to be blown up in 8 minutes. Colter Stevens takes\non another persons identity when he is placed on the train. He must\nsolve the crime in order that a follow up crime can be averted. He is\nrepeatedly placed back on the train to see if he can work out who is\nbehind the plot.<br><br>Maybe I'm a bit too old to buy into a plot like this, so consequently I\ncould never warm to the film. I am a big fan of Jake Gyllanhaal and he\ncan't be faulted for his performance in Source Code. The same can also\nbe said for Michelle Monaghan who certainly brightens the mood as his\ngirlfriend on the train. The interplay between the two leads certainly\nbears comparison with a similar situation in Groundhog Day.\n"},
{"review": "\nSource Code fails to suspend your belief - what's required to make you\nwant to play along with the \"who dun-nit\" aspect the director\nhopelessly baits you into.

Oh, and terrorists...they are everyday\nnormal looking dudes just like you. Uhhh, the propaganda! The action is\nlazy - just a CGI fire over and over.

Jake Gyllenhaal stars and while I usually don't\ncare for him much, he was excellent here. I have a feeling this\ncharacter may have been written specifically for him, because he's got\na strange style and seems to not fit many of his roles.

If someone is looking for a thriller then this is the one\nthat you shouldn't miss, but don't compare this with the movie\n'inception' as the movie have got much developed concept than this.\nThis movie would make you think about time, so someone who is in mood\nto watch some good sci-fi movie..,source code would be a good option\nfor them. This movie would entertain you even after you watch it,\nBecause the concept is filled on a beautiful pot with 6 holes and all\nyou have is five fingers to block the holes, when you block one hole\nthe concept leaks through another. Maybe i liked because i like to\nthink and the movie gives a plot for viewer to think on a varied\ninteresting concept. This is not a war movie or a gun shot thing, Its a\npure thriller.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was so intense and mind blowing that I had to register on\nthis site (IMDb) to write this review! Great movie, was slow and\nconfusing at first but ultimately kept you on the edge of your seat.\nYeah some parts kept repeating but it was so unique how this movie was\nput but in the end it left me satisfied and mind blown.<br><br>I was interrupted a few times during this intense movie but to tell you\nthe legit truth about my experience is this. One time I was interrupted\nafter an intense scene. I had to pause the movie and I was angry and\nupset that I was interrupted but I needed to drop my sister off to work\nso when I was backing up I was feeling so careless and upset because of\nall the interruptions. As I was backing up I felt like my mind was in\nthe concepts of the movie. I felt like if I made a mistake and I died\nin a car crash, I could wake up and retry. You will see if you haven't\nseen the movie what I meant. It left me mind blown.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie sneaks up on you, despite the basic premise being laid out\nearly on. It reveals slowly, with great pacing. The science fiction\naspect of the plot is daring, but the story hangs on to it without\ngetting drowned in concepts. The characters, the acting, are exactly\nwhat they need to be to make you care what happens next, and the ending\nis totally satisfying. You don't want it to end until the end, and when\nit does, you'll smile, knowing that it all worked out.<br><br>Asks the same question The Matrix asked, but without the pretension,\nwithout the slow-mo fighting, just with a perfect blend of science\nfiction, metaphysics and heart.\n"},
{"review": "\nWell i was sceptical when I first watched the trailer, after a weird\nstart and some focusing. I realized, whoa this is genius. Good actors,\ngood scenes, good story. I simply love this movie for it's creativity.\nI don't want to spoil anything in the review. But if you liked\nInception and other similar films you will love this one.It is deep,it\nwill make you think you should not fall asleeep during this one. Only\nnegative, it was too short in my opinion. This one could have so much\npotential.<br><br>I just wanted to put out the word, if you have not seen this movie.<br><br>I recommend you to watch it as soon as possible!\n"},
{"review": "\nTrailer is better than the film unfortunately. Horribly predictable,\nbelow-average editing, average script, good acting, light\nentertainment. Plot twist at the end but my bum was nowhere near the\nfront of my seat.<br><br>To be fair though it is intellectually interesting rather than\nHollywood's typical \"bang boom gargle explosion boobies!\"\nsci-thrill-fi.<br><br>I think I was just annoyed because the villain in the story is\ndelivered to you (at least I got it) in the very first scene. Like\nseriously editors/director/producers - how hard is it to stick to the\nmodern movie making principle of keep your friends close and enemies\ncloser? By not having the main character focusing in on the villain it\nbecome bleedingly obvious who it is. I'm sure that if you watched it\nthough and well, didn't pick up on who it is then the film would have a\nlot more going for it. 1.75/5 stars\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm glad I didn't read the second page of reviews before going to see\nthis movie or I might have had second thoughts (sorted by BEST). I\nliked the movie which is very much above average when compared to some\nof the drivel coming out of Hollywood these days. And Waffle...you\nfigured out the whole movie in the first few scenes and worked on a\ncross word puzzle during the movie? If you think this makes you sound\nsuper smart it does the opposite. Only a fool would stay if that bored.\nGeeze, it's a SciFi movie, which means it doesn't have to be plausible\nor real (The Fi stands for FICTION). All of you who had this criticism\nshould stay home and watch reality TV.\n"},
{"review": "\nwatching source code may remind you of many previous movies in which\nthe leading character would try to change the inevitable. \"DejaVu\";\n\"Next\" and many others. Moreover its again a Train movie it reminds me\nof UNSTOPPABLE also/ ----- \"Colter Stevens\" (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a\nsoldier who tries to change the past (at least in his mind) to save 52\npeople in the train; especially this girl \"Christina Warren\" (Michelle\nMonaghan).<br><br>The medium of traveling to and from source code and the fact of being\nsome one else in side SC and later upset body condition once you come\nback from SC; reminds me totally of \"The Matrix\" trilogy.<br><br>There is nothing new in the Plot of the movie however story-wise the\nmovie is good! again it has been tried to show in the movie that with\npersonal touch any soldier can go extra mile.

{"review": "\nHi there, in reviewing this movie I mean its so difficult to explain,\nits not one of those movies that you can really keep up with your eyes\nclose, you have to be alert at all times. I honestly didn't really\nenjoy it, the only reason I went to see it is because I think Jake\nGyllenhaal is hot!!! thats about it. and I like Michelle Monagan on the\nmovie that she did with patrick Dempsey Made of Honor..... If you are\nan action buff this might be your style. I honestly rather see movies\nLike Limitless, or the Lincoln Lawyer, Scream 4 that I might go far,\nthis its on a genre completely on its own. You have to keep following\neverything over and over and over, at times I just wanted to walk out\nof the theatre because I was getting bored ,I am sorry it was not\nentertaining enough for me. I was counting the seconds so I can leave,\nso in my opinion, pass it up, or wait til it comes out on DVD (blu ray\nor whatever)........ not for me. I guess Jake was great, Michelle stay\nIn romantic comedies. thats it.\n"},
{"review": "\nI give this movie a seven because I must admit it kept my attention and\nwas well acted/edited. However, although I realize this is just\nescapist lore, I think the \"science\" behind the time loop could have\nbeen better explained. One thing I noticed that, although he is\ncascading from one parallel universe to another, with each one being\nslightly different, the identity of the villain never changes. Also,\nhow does the controller know that the returning controllee is the same\nentity that originally went on the mission? Nevertheless, as pure\nentertainment, and if one allows oneself to release everything learned\nin Physics 101, it's worth seeing.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Source Code\" deals with interesting issues and themes for which if i\nreveal them then it could be seen as a spoiler alert, so i guess you'll\nhave to see it for yourself to see if you can highlight them, but what\ni can say is that with an exceptional cast and a clever plot which is\neasy to follow, \"Source Code\" keeps you watching to see if you can see\nwhere the twists and turns will be coming from. Jake Gyllenhaal brings\nsubstance to his character and the film and is a great actor in this\nfilm. His co-star Michelle who played in \"Eagle Eye\" (2008) plays a\nsimilar role for which she does really well and both of them together\nhave a great chemistry. There's not much more to say except that it has\na great cast, cool and original plot with cool twists and turns coming\nyour way!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is what a true sci-fi should be. It's fun, easy to watch, but\nthought-provoking and intelligent. I loved \"Moon\" and now, with \"Source\nCode\", Duncan Jones became just the guy to follow, in my book.<br><br>There are movies that use the sci-fi genre only to justify all those\nshiny SFX fireworks we all like so much. But once in a while another\nkind of sci-fi emerges. If you're a fan of BSG or B5 amongst others,\nyou know the kind. The one that is about people first, and flashy\nexploding photo-realistic spaceships second. It can be tough to sell\nsuch a complex film to an unprepared audience, but Source Code does it\nbrilliantly with emotion, romance, humor and top-notch performances.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie speaks about the ability to obtain informations from the\npast. As said in the movie, \"it is not time travel\", it is something\nelse. This \"something else\" is well engaged since the beginning. I was\nin the entire time, and it is not easy for me in that kind of movies\nbecause I analyzed everything. It is not too hard-science (like Primer\nfor instance) nor too stupid (like Transcendance). It is more like Edge\nof Tomorrow where the weight of action/science/love/thriller is well\nbalanced.<br><br>I recommend to see the movie if you like \"little\" mind-f***. I liked\nthe end, even if I don't think it can be realistic, but it is\nunexpected and appropriated in a sense...<br><br>So go watch it.\n"},
{"review": "\nWow. Having just watched Source Code I must say that this is a great\nmovie. The storyline is filled with twists and turns. The movie is\nsmartly built and wonderfully acted. Jake Gyllenhaal acts with\nemotional depth and gives us a look into the life of someone thrown\ninto such a strange and unsettling circumstances. The movie makes you\nfeel very smart for understanding each twist and turn. Every single\nsecond is well thought out and has the rest of the movie in mind. The\nmovie is clever. Of course the movie does toy around with some very\nprofound ideas, especially in the last few minutes, and sometimes they\ndon't always work. However most of the time the movie leaves you\nguessing and feeling sad for the loss and pain of the characters,\nescpically the main character. The sheer complexity makes it mind\nbending. But at the same time it's very straightforward to understand.\nAll in all its a great film with a few missteps are outdone by the\nbrilliance of the film. Thank you for reading. Goodbye.\n"},
{"review": "\nSource code is one of the best entertaining sci-fi thrillers i have\nseen so far.It's concept is kinda innovative and impressive also.Loved\nthe film.Though the main idea behind this technology may be confusing\nbut it's welcome all the way.

{"review": "\nThe story is kind of predictable for this type of movie. The groundhog\nday element gets old fast. Read the good reviews and expected more. It\nis just adequate - no more no less.

It's just not very interesting and the\nwhole thing feels repetitive and limited in scope.<br><br>Michelle Monaghan isn't pretty enough to carry this kind of show. She\nlooks a bit pig like - a younger Marcia Gay Harden and is more of a\ncharacter actress. Jake does an adequate job but anyone could have done\nit.

The concept of the movie is quite new, never seen it in movies\nbefore and I think that's exactly what people are looking for - it\nenriches our imagination.

{"review": "\nThis has got to be the best Sci-Fi/Love Story plot I've ever watched\nsince The Lakehouse. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who\nhas got a knack of dealing with mind-boggling scenarios while enjoying\nthe melodramatic mood. This of course has some violent scenes typical\nfor its own stretched-out plot of a time bomb set on a train and\nafterward the possibility a citywide holocaust. Jake's acting has been\ndriving and very involving. Michelle Monaghan is cute. She did it well\nand much relaxed. Though the mystery is easy off since the crime\nperpetrator can be guessed off pretty in the early minutes of the\nmovie, the winning part of the movie is by how every piece of evidence\nis stitched into one whole revelation and the realization that this has\ngo to be a love story. The ending surprisingly is most rewarding and\nwould bring you to several what- if's and how-come's. Definitely worth\nwatching and a genre mainstay until another far-fetched killer\nbrainchild comes across the big screen.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is as predictable as the trailer leads it to be. Whatever\nyou think will happen does. I didn't want to see this movie but did\nbecause my friends were going and had nothing else to do. Waste of time\nand money, and I'm surprised the 2 actors that are recognizable agreed\nto sign on. I would compare this movie to Unstoppable, not only because\nit is on a train but because I could have told you the ending without\never seeing it. The acting is OK but unworthy of these 2 actors and the\nunderlining story is undermined by the superfulous \"action\". The\n\"villain\" in this movie is left with questions unanswered (cane) and\nthe overall purpose of the program is not layed out.\n"},
