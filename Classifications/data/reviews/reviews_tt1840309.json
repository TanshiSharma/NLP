{"review": "\nMuch like similar teen girl action movie series this one kills itself\nearly on by introducing so many holes that the house of cards that they\nthen try to build has no foundation. <br><br>Before the credits are even over the story makes less than no sense.\nHaving destroyed civilisation in a world war (ok) Chicago survives. The\nsurvivors had enough materials to build a massive wall around the city,\n300ft high, but can barely feed themselves. Now they have split into 5\nfactions (actually 6 because they throw a lot of people out and call\nthem 'factionless') and this somehow magically creates peace. <br><br>So none of that makes sense, and much like Hunger Games, having built a\nnonsensical premise we now follow a teenage girl as she turns into a\nsuper-soldier capable of jumping of buildings fighting off trained\narmies single-handed (using a cheap looking paint-ball gun). All the\nwhile with her buff and perfectly capable new boyfriend doing as little\nas possible to help her. <br><br>Oh and I forgot a quick detour while we ride a pointless zip wire\nthrough some buildings for absolutely no reason than to try and spend\nsome of the left over special effects budget.<br><br>And occasionally Kate Winslet pops up, but is shot from funny angles\nall the time while they try to make her baby look less visible. Not\nthat they need to as her bad blonde hair is distracting enough.<br><br>All in a total waste of 2 hours. Just go and watch Twilight or Hunger\nGames for the same movie done slightly (but not a lot) better.\n"},
{"review": "\nAs I said, the movie was extremely predictable. I knew what was going\nto happen before it did and I honestly felt like I was watching it for\nthe 3rd time! There were no twists, no suspense, no surprises. I could\nnot believe that there would be so many clich\u00e9s and unrealistic scenes.\nInstead of an \"action/adventure film\" I saw a boring love story. I\ncan't imagine how unbearable it must have been for those who read the\nbook..<br><br>*SPOILER* The following scenes are examples of why the plot was so\nobvious and boring: <br><br>We knew that Tris would not go into the same faction as her family, we\nknew which one she'd choose, we knew that she'd fall in love with Four,\nwe knew that she wouldn't get kicked out of training, we knew that Four\nwould find out that she was a Divergent but wouldn't tell anybody\netc... Moreover, the scene where Tris and Four fight is so unrealistic\nand again, the fact that he started fighting on her side was way too\nPREDICTABLE. <br><br>*END OF SPOILER*<br><br>To me, Divergent looked like a bad version of the Hunger Games and I am\nreally surprised that so many people liked it. Unless you are a teenage\ngirl who finds Theo James hot and unless you have never read any books\nor watched any other movies in your life, I see no reason why you would\nwant to waste 2 and a half hours of your life watching Divergent.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is perfect storm of bad movie making: a stupid story, bad acting\nand bad directing. Who is ultimately to blame? Money grubbing CEO's.\nWho else? <br><br>Thanks to the mega-success of the Hunger Games and Harry Potter,\nHollywood's scouring young adult books, like some pedophile in a\nplayground, looking for new material to get their greasy hands on. <br><br>Divergent is one of those series. I've not read the books, but in the\nmovie, you belong to one of 5 factions. Our heroine does not - she's\ndivergent - and that apparently frightens the powers that be. <br><br>Why? Because individualism is seen as a threat. In much the way\nindependent film makers are perceived a threat in Hollywood. <br><br>What follows is one inane, dumb, idiotic scene after another.

{"review": "\nWhen reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate\nto film. It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is\ninternalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to\nadapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make\nchanges to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly\nthink it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour\ninterpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay\ntrue and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was\nset up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave\nsolid performances and the special effects and action sequences were\ndone well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at\nbest.\n"},

In fact, instead of watching\nthis near 2 1/2 hour movie, watch a piece of crap. It will have a\nbetter plot than this flick. The first hour and forty-five minutes\n(precisely) are spent on the wrong thing. It makes reference to the\n\"government\" (cough CAPITOL) to being some sort of evil, but rather\nfocuses on Tris becoming part of a cult. It doesn't even make clear\nwhat they do. It gives no reason to why they are in \"factions\". There\nwere so many plot holes I would have thought Tommy Wiseau wrote it. The\nguys name is Four. Four. Apparently the author of the book thought,\n\"Well, anyone who reads this is a moron anyway.\" Four. Why? Why?\nWHY???? I understand that this garbage was only put together to make\nmoney, but did they have to assume everyone is an idiot? Couldn't they\nat least let it make sense? Or shorter? Or less cheesy? Or better\nacted? Or more focused? Or more intelligent? There was a point when\nTris argues with Kate Winslet's character that them choosing isn't a\nmatter of free will. Or at least she almost does. Right when it seems\nlike the movie has any brain they shut it down in a hurry. There is way\ntoo much wrong about this movie.

The violence is sanitized with the only real blood being\nwhen Four nicks Tris's ear with a knife toss. The two most horrifying\nscenes in the book are not even included: the attempted rape of Tris by\nPeter's gang and the transfer girl who jumps from the train and misses\nthe Dauntless rooftop to splat on the street below.

{"review": "\nI was actually pretty excited about watching this movie. My cousin\nthought it was great and better than Hunger games, so I read the books\nbefore I watched the movie. I liked the books, but there were a few\nthings I wasn't satisfied about. The relationship between Tris and Four\nis confusing and spontaneous, completely out of the blue and random. In\nthe movie it is worse. They barely know each other, Tris' ear gets cut\nfrom Four, then Tris is making out with Four topless. They didn't\ninclude a lot of the important characters, like Uriah and Peter's crew.\nThey barely acknowledged the characters they did put into the movie and\nthere seemed to be no importance in them. Al's suicide was a big thing\nin the book and it didn't really make an impact in the movie, there was\nno significance, I wouldn't have felt any emotion if I hadn't read the\nbook. Will, Christina, Tris and Al's friendship is too muted and you\ndon't really get to know any of the characters well, the character\ndevelopment was non-existent, . Four of the characters I couldn't\nreally tell apart from the others, Will, Al, Peter and Drew looked\npretty much identical. Too much is left out and there are too many\nchanges added to the movie that make no sense. In Tris' fear landscape\nit seems that Four is trying to rape her and she has to violently fight\nhim off. In the book it is playful and she ends up laughing it off.\nEdward's knife stabbing in the eye accident is also left out and that\nwas an incredibly important scene.<br><br>This movie just really disappointed me, I never really get disappointed\nwith movies, but this just frustrated me too much.<br><br>The books and movie both had great potential but were just a little bit\noff.\n"},

{"review": "\nDivergent is gripping and intelligently brought to life on the big\nscreen from the director who brought us \"Limitless\" and \"The\nIllusionist.\" Are we seeing something of similar essence with the\n\"Hunger Games\" series? Yes.

Her graceful emergence from shy personality to\ndominance is done artfully and really speaks to her ability as an\nactress. Theo James is also exceptional in the co-pilot role and almost\neffortlessly seems to pull off the bad boy with standards persona in a\nmanner I haven't seen since Will Smith in his prime. The plot is high\noctane and especially more gritty than I first imagined. The emotion\nraw in intensity and empathic build. As a guy who was just going to\nthis film to act as arm candy and a shoulder to lean on for my highly\nenthused girlfriend, I can write this piece while honestly saying that\nmy eyes were glued to the screen the entirety of the film and was\npleased to see this film do such an excellent job at developing both\nthe plot and characters involved in it.

For instance; Tris is told that\nshe's kicked out of the Dauntless group, yet 5 minutes later she\nfollows the group and the very same person who kicks her out has\nnothing against it.

More than 90% of users reviews\nare negative and still the movie given as 7.7 stars I mean isn't is the\nbiggest proof that producers well paid the critics too. Well, before\nthe movie release they start promoting movie which is the typical case\nof every big budget movies but they started promoting actress and actor\nof the movie in every magazine and newspapers, basically they wanted to\ncreate a reel life imitating real life scenario between the leading\npair the way it happened with Twilight series and because of that, the\nTwilight series otherwise one of the worse Vampire/Ware-wolf series\nmade lot of money they bank on Kristen and Robert Pattison love\nchemistry, so the production houses tried to bank on Shailene &amp; Theo\nchemistry in real life, but it seems that Shailene is not only pretty\nbut she is smart as well, she has lot of potential and she didn't play\nthat game.

But 'Divergent' falls flat\non it's face largely due to Shailene Woodley's debut as \"Beatrice\" and\nTheo James. Overall, Divergent is familiar fare, but served up by a\ncast that is fiercely dedicated to phoning in the material.

When Beatrice chose\nthe paramilitaristic faction (called Dauntless) I was prepared for a\nfilm designed to rake in the dumb-down dollars.

The setup is so tapped into standard youthful fears\n(tests determining who you are, the unknown first sexual experience,\nhaving multiple interests when you are told you should only have one\nstrength) that Divergent is essentially a high school movie. Whether or\nnot that continues in the next film doesn't really concern me, although\nthe likelihood of more booms and swoon is probably strong since the\nenemies are the intellectuals and the heroes are the brawn that ditched\ntheir social service upbringing.

Entire chunks of the\nplots were missing- and not subtle ones either. Very KEY EVENTS ARE NO\nWHERE TO BE FOUNS WITHIN THIS FILM. it is a waste of time to go see it\nin theaters.

{"review": "\nI have to say that the producers would have to be stupid not to use\nBurger again as the director. He did such a great job with this one. I\nthought I was going to see a film that was mostly aimed at teens.\nHowever the story alone makes this far superior to most teen oriented\nfilms. In fact this didn't feel much like a teen film at all. The\nfantasy story is a great metaphor for our current society, it's simply\na very relevant film. The directing here was spot on. The story as fun\nas it is, does have a few holes, sure, but they are easy to look over\nbecause they are such small holes. The film simply works as a\ncommentary piece on political philosophy, and as an entertaining action\nfilm laced with some romantic tension. In my view this film was far,\nfar superior to the very teen oriented and very one dimensional Hunger\nGames, and it's certainly more unique as well.

{"review": "\nLast year, book to movie adaptations were very hit and miss. The Mortal\nInstruments City of Bones was an example of an absolute terrible\nadaptation. Completely butchered, over adapted to the point were it's\nlike a parody of the source material. I'm not a purist, but it was\nsimply down right sad. Nothing like the book. Then I saw Catching Fire\nwhich was an example of a near perfect book to movie adaptation.\nCharacters nailed it, not over adapted, and properly paced. This movie\nDivergent however was exactly like The Mortal Instruments movie. As\nsomeone who read the books, this adaptation was an absolute\nembarrassment. <br><br>One: This movie was over adapted! Too many important, meaningful scenes\nand components from the books were cut out, leaving us a Hollywood\nwrecked, cobbled together pretender of the book. <br><br>Two: The evil characters were not evil. Plus an added bonus, most of\nthem were devoid of character development Peter wasn't evil, he barely\ngot any screen time! And his entourage of sociopaths, who oppressed and\ntried to kill Tris in the book were done terribly. Molly had two lines\nduring the entirety of the film, and one was complimenting Tris! Drew\nwas the worst, he was non-existent in the film. No screen time for him.\nAnd Eric, totally a one dimensional character. Lack any emotion or\ncharacter development or even a reason for him to even exist in the\nstory! <br><br>Three: There was little to no conflict in this movie for the\nprotagonist Tris. Without conflict, there is no narrative, no plot\nprogression, and ultimately no entertainment value. Things were\nresolved so easy in the movie it was ridiculous. Tris is told she has\nfailed initiation; which never happened in the books, and she just\nstays against orders of her superiors without complaint. What? Not\nplausible by any means. <br><br>They should just cancel the squeal because there's no talent, evident\nof this movie. <br><br>1/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI felt like the movie deviated too far from the original story. The\nmain plot was the same but the way the book introduces the conflict is\nmuch more interestingly done. In addition the age gap between the main\ncharacters, Tris and Tobias (Four), seems a bit off. Just a few missed\nscenes and minor details, I would have liked a more realistic\ntransition into Tris and Tobias' relationship, as it seemed a bit\nabrupt and confusing. The original book focused a bit more on Tris'\nevolution from her original faction to Dauntless, this gave the\ncharacter more depth in my opinion. I would have also liked to see more\nabout Tris and her friends (maybe an intro to Uriah or some of the\nother dauntless-born initiates would have been nice).

There is also a different\nrelationship between Tris and Four in this movie that in the book, and\nI like the book version better.

{"review": "\nGoodness gravy gracious, I don't even know where to begin berating this\ntrain wreck of a film. I suppose I'll begin by criticizing the fact\nthat the characters had little to no development whatsoever.

I'm not insinuating\nthat there is anything awry about designing characters to simply exist\nand complete the fictitious paradigm, but rather that the writers\nshould be privy of the fact that the audience could care less if they\ndie later on. The acting was also astoundingly mediocre. Even during\nthe resolution of the film's primary conflict, you can discern an\nincredibly cringe inducing, spurious inflection in the antagonist's\nvoice as she frustratedly reacts to her defeat with irritable overused\nphrases such as \"NO, WHY YOU.\" This film also resorts to \"shocking\" or\n\"plot twist\" scenes roughly every five minutes.

They should have started out\nsaying why the everything had fallen. That part is probably for another\nmovie. Let me guess that where will be about 3 movies. First one how\nthey broke the system, Second one how it got like this, and Third is\nlikely to be about more survivors but I hope they don't make more about\nit.\n"},
{"review": "\nQuite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Whoever wrote this\nsteaming pile of utter drivel should be punished for the pain it\ninflicts on viewers. The 'director' should never be allowed to work\nagain. Awful writing, embarrassingly clich\u00e9d, terrible acting.\nHonestly, save your time and sanity and go stare at a wall, it's far\nmore interesting than this crap. I really don't know what's happened to\nHollywood filmmaking of late but it certainly seems they've managed to\nplummet to new depths of drivel. IMDb needs to start a negative rating\nsystem because '1' simply doesn't do something this bad enough justice.\nAvoid this like the plague people or, if you have to choose, take the\nplague. You'll feel better for it!\n"},
{"review": "\nTake a brilliant concept that reflects some possible future scenario -\ninspired by the marvelous Aldous Haxley's 'Brave new world' - add a\ntwisted 'matrixinian, hunger games' wanna be variation from Veronica\nRoth - and finally make a Hollywood film out of it; what do you have?\nAn insult to human intelligence.<br><br>The first 5 minutes of the film, focused on the essence. They where\ngreat. The rest of the long 2 hours where a bad mixture of the hunger\ngames without the hunger, the matrix without mr Anderson, star treck\nwithout the stars, and dumb running, kicking, fighting, agonizing for\nno reason what so ever mambo jumbo. <br><br>Overall quality? No better than a B class TV series. So why 7.4 in\nIMDb? Surely can't tell (paid reviews I presume). So I give a one star\nto balance things out. <br><br>What is the message? In a future where mankind faces serious identity\nissues, where individuality is replaced by casts, where society is a\nthreat to humanity... then what does one do??? Learn karate, pick up a\ngun and shoot the hell out of the bad guys!!! Wooaaoou! Totally mature\nand intelligent! I seriously prefer swangeneger's philoshopy 'Destroy\nda planat and get da hell oder heeer'.<br><br>Hollywood's intention: Insult humans to the degree they begin to like\nit. Make ridiculous films so that every one turns into TV shows. Then\nkeep serving them insulting TV shows... they won't mind... they are\n'brain dead' to quality and originality. Thank's Hollywood, I'll pass\n(next time at least, cause I wasted 2 hours+ watching this crap).\n"},
{"review": "\nDon't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the Divergent Series. I am\ncurrently reading Insurgent. I was excited when Divergent became a\nmovie. Since the book was amazing I had high expectations. Sadly my\nexpectations were not met. They had skipped many important plot points\nthroughout the film. A few examples are why Tobias is called Four, the\nback story of Tobias (which was only briefly mentioned in his fear\nlandscape), when Tris is caught by Eric after going to the Erudite\ncompound, Peter feeling up and degrading Tris's body when they try to\npush her off into the chasm, for capture the flag they originally use\npaint balls, Christina grabs the flag, Tobias originally is the only\nperson in the control room and he was the one to shut it down, and many\nmore. The ending left out a great deal of conversation between Caleb\nand Tobias. Peter and Molly are made to look less violent and extreme\nin the movie. There were not many fight scenes which was disappointing.\nThey also did not add a lot of scenes where Tobias and Tris start being\nclose. The movie made their romance so sudden. The book is definitely a\n9.5/10 but the movie lacked and strayed from the book thus why I give\nit a 6/10.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie sucks and it sucks big time. Believe me, this is the first\nreview of my life for a movie. I simply can not believe that the\naverage rating is 7.5 in IMDb.<br><br>Please save yourself from watching this meaningless piece of crap! I\nwatched this movie along with my 6 friends and none of them knew which\nmovie we are gonna watch, they just went because of me.<br><br>It is just too slow! 140 MINUTES!<br><br>I lost all hope for this movie after 100 minutes were passed and we\nwere thinking of going out of the cinema.<br><br>Interesting storyline made in to sh1t due to crappy performances from\nall of the actors.<br><br>Somewhat similar to Hunger games. However, Hunger games was much much\nmuch better than this poor attempt.\n"},
{"review": "\nOverall, this movie clearly had a targeted audience, teen girls. The\nmovie itself is not a bad movie, but i am not in its target audience so\ni didn't enjoy it that much. The music was teenie, acting was average\nat best, plot was mostly predictable and very easy to follow. The story\nline is stupid...splitting everyone its factions, ya cause we all know\nthat wont cause problems and power struggles. I never read the book,\nbut the movie had major holes and it was almost hard to watch. There\nwas minimal action and comedy and it was mostly about teenage\nproblems:fitting in, hot \"bad guy\" guy and such and such...Unless you\nare a teenage trapped in a adult body, this movie is below average, but\nit could be worse.<br><br>I've seen worse, but I've seen a whole lot better\n"},
{"review": "\nFor a movie with so much hype around it, this was just terrible. I\nhaven't read the book and considering what I saw as the story, will not\nread it. I know this is fiction but the story sounds plain stupid.\nPeople are split into factions? Its as if everybody's brain went\nthrough some mutation and they lost their human nature itself. Don't\ncare how it is explained in the book, but its not explained in the\nmovie at all. <br><br>Very bad story, average acting, full of clich\u00e9s, very slow.<br><br>Even if the books are not as bad as the movie, the adaptation totally\nfailed. Lord of the Rings was made out of a book. I never read it but\nlook at that movie. That's how you make movies.<br><br>Absolutely not recommended. Sheer waste of time.\n"},
{"review": "\nI wanted to like it. I really did. After reading the book I was looking\nforward to this film and could not make it through without fast\nforwarding. The main problem is the story which is highly narrative\ndoes not translate. Not that it couldn't have. The screen writing is\nterrible and is largely word-for-word from the book. Key elements to\nunderstanding the characters and the story are missing from the film. I\ndon't know how anyone could understand the film without reading the\nbook. Honestly a horrible film and the screenwriter should be\nembarrassed.<br><br>Since the film has lucked into earning a lot of money and therefore\nsequels, hopefully they will take this as an opportunity to bring in\nnew screenwriters and editors.<br><br>Don't waste your money for sure. Only waste your time if you are at\nhome and doing something else at the same time.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's hard to come up with ten lines about this movie. This \"Hunger\nGames meets Harry Potter\" disaster does not make any sense. It's both\npredictable and insanely boring. But above the lack of cinematic\ninterest it's just dumb. <br><br>I don't get where did the get the inspiration for the Dauntless, but to\nme they are just a bunch of idiots risking their life for no good\nreason. They are supposed to be the military men of this new society,\nbut they do no reflect any traditional military values, they are\nreckless, undisciplined, and their training looks like is only designed\nto injure their own members. <br><br>In the end, beside the poor explanation they give for this \"dystopian\"\nfuture, and the incredibly absurd plot, the movie is just not\nentertaining enough.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm a fan of near-future films set in dystopian worlds, but this\n'Hunger Games' rip-off never tries to reach beyond its obvious\n16-24-year old demographic. Young adults are assigned to clan-like\ngroups based on their personality type. Those who do not fit any\nprofile, Divergents, are seen as a threat. This flimsy premise is the\nbasis for an incoherent narrative that neither entertains not provokes\nthought. The sole purpose seems to be to show the young, fit cast\nrunning, jumping, climbing, punching, kicking ass and wielding big\nguns. Kate Winslet mugs it up and it would not be a surprise if she\nwinked directly at camera. I wasn't expecting it to be 'Gattaca', but\nthe fact that it is this flat and predictable is disappointing.\n"},
{"review": "\nA 10 year old may enjoy this movie, but for the rest, it sucks. There\nis no reason to like any of the characters. The lead female is not even\nattractive to look at. Whenever a female character is trying to be like\na male, I don't find it attractive in any form or shape, and if the\nface is nothing to look at then it's bad news all over. This movie is\nthe production of a marriage between Harry Potter and The Hunger Games\nwhere the mother (The Hunger Game) drank too much alcohol, smoked too\nmuch cigarettes and used every possible drugs during its pregnancy, and\nguess what, the child comes out completely deformed, mentally deranged,\nhorrible to look at, and unbearable to watch. The CIA should use this\nmovie to get confessions out of the Al Qaeda suspects. It works. My\nex-wife used it on me and I confessed to everything. Bad story, bad\nacting, bad everything. There are better movies to watch.\n"},
{"review": "\nOK, where to begin. Why oh why does this type of crappy, stupid, make\nno sense, dribble, poor excuse for a movie get made? I rolled my eyes\nthru out the movie. So many issues, why this has over a 2 rating is\nbeyond me. The plot was stupid, each scene was so predictable, You knew\nthat Four and Trish were going to get together, they didn't bother with\ntrying to develop why they ended up together, it just spontaneously\nhappened, their 'love' story was completely unbelievable. Why was there\na train running? Who was running the train? What was the purpose of the\ntrain other than something for the actors to jump on and off?! Trish\nbecoming a kick ass fighter was totally unbelievable as well, the\nactress who played her did not pull off becoming 'tough' I laughed at\nthe parts she was supposed to be beating up others, it was soo corny.\nThis movie was boring, dumb, nonexistent plot that made any sense.\nDon't believe the 7.5 rating\n"},
{"review": "\nI am about 35 mins away from finishing this thing and I am still lost!\nI paused the movie and started reading these reviews trying to see if\nit could help me understand what the f is going on..

{"review": "\nHonestly was very disappointed by this movie.<br><br>If I hadn't read the book first I'd be totally lost as to what's really\ngoing on. They do not explain anything and to top that off it's not\nnecessarily the same as In the book either, so much left out is really\nneeded to tel the story. There was nothing keeping my attention on the\nscreen.. Boring, predictable, badly written, badly acted and just plain\nblah. I went into watching hunger games thinking the worst and couldn't\ntake my eyes off, but this movie I thought would have the same\nexcitement and falls far short.

I don't\nknow anything about the book, maybe if it went deeper into the history\nor something...even still I just can't see how anyone could enjoy this\nPOS.

{"review": "\nDivergent\" is all about identity\u0097about searching your soul and\ndetermining who you are and how you fit in as you emerge from\nadolescence to adulthood. So it's all too appropriate that the film\nversion of the wildly popular young adult novel struggles a bit to\nassert itself as it seeks to appeal to the widest possible audience.<br><br>It's the conundrum so many of these types of books face as they become\npop-culture juggernauts and film franchises: which elements to keep to\nplease the fervent fans and which to toss in the name of maintaining a\nlean, speedy narrative? The \"Harry Potter\" and \"Hunger Games\"\nmovies\u0097which \"Divergent\" resembles in myriad ways\u0097were mostly\nsuccessful in finding that balance.<br><br>In bringing the first novel of Veronica Roth's best-selling trilogy to\nthe screen, director Neil Burger (\"Limitless\") and screenwriters Evan\nDaugherty and Vanessa Taylor have included key moments and images but\ntweaked others to streamline the mythology and move the story along.\nThe results can be thrilling but the film as a whole feels\nsimultaneously overlong and emotionally truncated.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you're stuck on a long flight with little else to do, then you may\nend up like me stuck watching this terrible movie.<br><br>The post-apocalyptic setting always has potential. But this script and\ndialog are dumbed down to a nauseating level. Delta may need to\nre-stock those vomit bags.<br><br>The cast is star-laden. But Kate Winslet should be ashamed of herself\nfor accepting her role in this movie. The other stars don't do\nthemselves any favors either.
