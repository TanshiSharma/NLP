{"review": "\n2014 has proved to be a successful year so far for Marvel with 'Captain\nAmerica: The Winter Soldier' and the most recent 'X-Men: Days of Future\nPast'. Bryan Singer returns for the most recent X-Men after being\nabsent for the past four films, and what a return he has made. 'Days of\nFuture Past' is truly an impressive and spectacular instalment in both\nthe 'X- Men' franchise and the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe,\ncombining the casts from both the original trilogy and the prequel\nallowing the audience to view the 'X-Men' in the past, present and\nfuture. The action scenes are intense and spectacularly choreographed\nwith some fantastic heroes and foes fighting both against and alongside\neach other. As a personal opinion, 'Days of Future Past' is the best\nfilm to have graced the Marvel film franchise and one of the greatest\nsuperhero films of all-time. A visually stunning and exhilarating flick\nthat combines the best elements of the series to create a fantastic and\nentertaining film.\n"},
{"review": "\nOMG!!! This movie cannot be simply described in words. If you loved X\nmen first class then this movie is a treat for you. This is a movie\neven non-x men fans will enjoy. Go see this movie guys. Your mind will\nbe blown. I've already seen this movie and looking forward to see it\nagain. <br><br>Hugh Jackman does the best wolverine ever. He became the wolverine i\nwanted to see on screen for ages. The interesting chemistry between\nJames McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is more enjoyable than ever. But\njennifer lawrence and Evan Peters at Quicksilver steal the movie.\nQuicksilver may not look so cool but he is the coolest guy in the whole\nmovie. <br><br>Believe me, this movie is worth your bucks. Moreover there are a bunch\nof new x men characters introduced in the movie which make it more\nenjoyable.Bryan Singer has done complete justice to this movie. And\nthere is one scene just halfway through the movie which is worth\nwatching fifty times. I am thoroughly excited to see the next entry\nentry in series which is being called Apocalypse.<br><br>The only shortcoming in the movie is the runtime which feels a little\nless being only 130 mins. Rest of the movie is a jigsaw which fits\ntogether in a wondrous puzzle.<br><br>So you must go to see this movie. Every element is in a balanced form.\nEven the soundtrack is fitting. <br><br>Happy watching !!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nDays of Future Past continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. I have\nto classify it as a work of art/comic book pulp fiction. The\ncharacters, effects, and story are outstanding. Everything in this\nmovie is exceedingly better in the sequel then even the first two films\nand First Class. Like X2, the acting is superb and the dialogue is\nrich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every\nside of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones\nwho are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and\nbigotry only add to the depth of this film. What's better then its\npredecessor X3 in every way. It restores the sense of epic adventure\nand grand-scale storytelling that's been absent from far too many of\nmost alleged blockbusters.<br><br>This film is far more sophisticated and has a better story than any\nX-Men movie to date. Here, the characters previously introduced but\nunder used are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the\nnewly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story.\nThe music is very good as is the special effects. The budget clearly\nhit the screen fully and there are truly some amazing sequences to\nbehold. The cast-selection is still perfect.<br><br>Overall, this is one of the best genre films of all-time.\n"},
{"review": "\nRight now, I'm still trying really hard to find out one bad thing from\nthe X-Men movie I've just seen: <br><br>The characters maybe ? No: every single character is perfectly\nrepresented,interpreted (in particularly with a stunning James McAvoy\nand an impressive Michael Fassbender) and useful to the story. Maybe\nthe plot then ? No: you'll get easily into it, because it is very well\nwritten for the screen, meaning you will be transported as Bryan Singer\nseems to know perfectly how to put in place a very cinematic puzzle.\nEmotions ? You will get some, as long as you loved the original X-Men\ncharacters. The soundtrack ? It is spotless and superbly fitting.\nVisual Effects ? Always there when we want them to be, and not when it\nis unnecessary. Action scenes ? You'll be amazed, thrilled and\ncaptivated when you will realize that every single scene has a purpose,\nwhether it has some action or simple emotions and character's\ndevelopment.<br><br>All these qualities put together are forming a very classical but\nexcellent &amp; accomplished movie, completed by a skilled sense of\ncinematic continuity that we didn't have since Singer left the\nfranchise (at least until X-Men First Class). In other words, you\nshould not be afraid to see this movie, because if you don't want to be\ndisappointed, I can tell : you won't be. <br><br>But is the future of this X-Men movie truly set ? This is something\nyou'll have to figure out by yourselves, and this until the very end of\nthe credits...\n"},

X-Men might be my favorite superhero movie (except\nwolverine spin off), and DOFP might be the best of them. It's an all\nstar movie with a good director (everything not related to\nprofessionalism is irrelevant), in paper it's guaranteed to be at least\na decent movie,and boy, they didn't disappoint me at all, really\nsurpassed my expectation.<br><br>I am absorbed, nothing else matter except the scenes in front of me.It\nalready had my attention since the overview of the future narrated by\nprofessor X. The story has a good pacing,not to slow but not to fast. I\ndidn't notice any plot holes, and there's nothing in the script that\nannoyed me. Bryan Singer could handle the dramatic and epic scenes very\nwell. the dramatic scenes makes me teared up a little,the epic scenes\nput me on the edge of my seat. And he sew the humor seamlessly, it was\nappropriate and subtle,just what I like.<br><br>They said that DOFP lack of any definitive villains, but any movie\ndoesn't need definitive villains to be good. X-Men movies is always\nabout fighting the enemy inside every humans and mutants, it's always\nabout self struggle, defeating the darkness inside of you.<br><br>4/5 (cause nothing's perfect)\n"},
{"review": "\nI went into this movie with high expectations so that may be the reason\nwhy I wasn't at all impressed with this film. The action was bland,\nshort and just seemed like everything we've already seen before. The\ntruly only great part of this movie was the scene with quicksilver and\nthat was a really short piece of the movie. Once that scene was over\nthe rest of the movie became this huge bore. I go to a movie like this\nwith the usual expectation of seeing something \"new\".. well I was let\ndown.<br><br>The majority of the movie was completely boring. There were only a few\nscenes of very mediocre action and it just seemed like they did not put\na lot of effort into this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nFor those who would have watched all previous x-men movies, this movie\nwill make it all go waste(except x-men first class). Actually the whole\nmovie is based on humans capturing mystique in 1973, some years after\nthe time in x-men first class, and using her DNA to make powerful\nsentinels to eliminate mutant race. Now here maybe some questions that\nyou might think after watching the movie: 1. If Mystique was captured\nin 1973, how did she make an appearance in x-men 1,2,3? 2. How can\nMagneto control the sentinels(robots) and really large objects (A\nFootball stadium) in 1973? 3. If the future is changed, then wolverine\nwould never get his adamantium claws as Mystique takes her in the end\nof movie. So was there any sense watching x-men origins wolverine? 4.\nFinally, if no-one dies, than is there any sense of watching x-men\n1,2,3 where many characters(Silver Fox, Scott, Jean, Stryker, etc) gets\nkilled? Answer to all these questions is: The directors think the\npublic is stupid and they will earn no matter what crappy story based\nx-men story they make.\n"},
{"review": "\nOrdinary people do not matter. In many ways this film apes the way that\npeople who belong to minorities have more rights than everyone else and\nthink they can do whatever the hell they like.<br><br>In this film the mutants have nearly been wiped out by robot Sentinels\nbuilt by humans and programmed only to kill people with the mutant X\ngene. Yet is makes it clear in the dystopian future the movie starts in\nthat these Sentinels also kill ordinary people, which makes no sense\nwhatsoever.<br><br>Like a lot a time-travel movies, it has daft plot holes and doesn't\ncare about consistency. Towards the film's climax, serial murderer\nMagneto manages to get the anti-mutant robots to obey him by using his\npowers to put steel inside them. Okay, that would allow his powers to\nwork on these things, but he wouldn't be able to give them orders,\nthat's just dumb, but he does when it suits the meandering plot.<br><br>Over long, overly serious and ultimately disappointing. The effects are\ngood, but they're the usual high end computer Paint Box fare that are\nblatantly not actually there.<br><br>If you're easily impressed and don't care about logic or any\ncharacterization or depth, you may still enjoy this.\n"},
{"review": "\nThey should stop calling these movies X-men. It should just be called\nWolverine. I hate what they have done to x-men. Bishop is in the movie\nfor maybe 5 min and the story is about going back in time. If your the\ntype of person that has no knowledge of the X-men universe and just\nwant to have a good time watching a movie you may have enjoyed it, but\nyou were robbed. You were robbed of what the X-men really are and that\nis complex characters with richer struggles and woe. They have failed\nto illustrate all the love triangles and created ones that simply don't\nexist. I just don't know what to say anymore. I see this movie has a\ngood rating. I don't think i can trust the rating system here any\nlonger.\n"},
{"review": "\nEasily the best X Men film yet with a storyline that requires you to\nthink whilst marvelling at the amazing special effects and action\nscenes taking place before your eyes. James McAvoy puts in a superb\nperformance as an embittered Professor X and there are great\nperformances from Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender in their\nrespective roles as Wolverine and Magneto but the person everyone is\ngoing to be talking about is a new mutant to the series called\nQuicksilver played superbly with the right amount of arrogance and\nlikability by Evan Peters. His huge action scene where he is required\nto rescue an imprisoned Magneto from a heavily guarded Pentagon is an\nabsolute delight and already a contender of most amazing action scene\nof the year and I cant see anything beating it. Trust me - you will\nwant to watch this scene again and again as there is so much to marvel\nat. Pity that Quicksilver is absent after this as the film does sorely\nmiss the character. Hoping to see more of him in the future. The film\ndoes have a great climax though featuring a highly inventive use of a\nfootball stadium and a post credits scene with a hint of what to expect\nin the next movie. All in all a great movie that is going to delight\nand entertain young and old alike.\n"},
{"review": "\nI've waited a long time for this one. X-Men: First Class was truly\nfirst class in my opinion, from the perspective of a\ncomic-book-turned-movie. I thought there is no way for Days of Future\nPast to disappoint me, but sadly, I was wrong.<br><br>Don't get me wrong or think I am to negative - the movie is visually\ngreat (especially the \"villains\") and the actors do their job more than\nwell. The story is also very interesting and gripping. However, when I\nwatch a Marvel movie, I expect action, thrills and adventure. I do like\ndrama - but not here and definitely not that much. A bit of drama would\nbe OK, but the levels of melodrama we get from certain characters (I\ndon't want to spoil anything so I'll skip the name, but you'll know it\nwhen you see it) are simply not fitting for this kind of movie.<br><br>After some great starting sequences, my wife and I started wondering\nwhy is the movie losing pace and when will the \"real X-Men movie\"\nstart. We rolled our eyes more than once during some scenes, although\nwe are both huge franchise fans.<br><br>I give it a six because I like X-Men and it's visually great and the\nstory is okay. But that is as high as it gets for me. Despite that, I\nwould recommend watching it because I see some very good reviews here\nso I hope not all of you find it as disappointing as I did.\n"},

My Verdict \u0096 Singer and Company Delivered!!!<br><br>The movie does start out a bit slow in the first few minutes, but\nquickly picks up steam as Hugh Jackman's \"Wolverine\" is sent back to\n1973, to try avoid the creations of the Evil Robot \"Sentinels\" which\nbasically appear set to wipe out Mutants and Humans alike in the\npresent day.

The plot is simple\nenough, go back in time to save the future; it's not groundbreaking nor\nis it adding anything new to the table as a time-travel movie but it\ndoes make for a great back and forth of characters, action sequences\nand pacing. Some scenes you may find carry on for a bit too long as if\nthe film was stalling for something but the reward is to see some of\nthe best action an X-Men film has to offer, with new additions to the\ncast such as Bishop, Warpath, Blink and Sunspot you really feel these\nare the scenes we have been waiting for, mutants working as a team to\nfight evil. One problem I felt before the film was how Quicksilver\nlooked, really didn't like the pale skin, the silver leather jacket BUT\nthe scenes he was in were probably the most memorable and even\nlaugh-out-loud funny and set some worries aside on his character.\nOverall I think this movie could have failed at being good very easily\nand so many times for so many reasons but it didn't at all, besides a\nfew minor things in the story which seem a bit too easy to go for and\ndidn't challenge itself more this is the X-Men film you have wanted to\nsee for a long time and fans will not be disappointed with this one.\n"},

The greatest strength of this movie lays on how it pays so much\nmore attention to its story and script than the visual spectacle it can\nsurely serve. Surprisingly, the movie vaunts some funny and light\nmoments particularly those with Quicksilver (Evan Peter). Quicksilver\nhas enjoyed highlight in this film as his section is streaked with\nlaugh-rendering wit and humor. Jennifer's role is arguably one of the\ncentral if not the most vital in the movie. Hugh Jackman's take remains\nthe same, but somehow feels fresh. Michael Fassbender's Magneto and\nJames McAvoy's Professor X are satisfying than their old counterparts,\nwhich, by the way, is not surprising, as the rest of the cast are\nactually just story pawns.<br><br>'Days of Future Past' is a bold take to raise the X-Men franchise into\nanother level. It toying with history is ambitious, suspenseful and\nconfusing, but it nonetheless manages to escalate itself to a higher\nground.

When it comes to time\ntravel, it just opens a tall bottle of questions. Of course Magneto is\nback as the bad guy. That adds to my angst. Did the X-Men have no other\nvillains? Just like the Batman franchise, always the Joker. Just like\nthe Spiderman franchise, always the Green Goblin. So why wasn't I\nsurprised. Nothing in this movie stood out to me. No one character\ngrabbed my attention. Though it was refreshing to see Kitty Pryde /\nShadowcat finally getting air time and not all Halle \"lookit me lookit\nme\" Berry. So again, Redbox saved the day. Only $1.27 to rent it. Not\n$12 at the theater and definitely not $20 for DVD or $30 for Blu Ray. I\ngave the movie a generous 5 in case it was me and I missed or\nmisunderstood vital info in the other X-Men / Wolverine movies that\nlead to this movie.\n"},

I never roll my eyes but this was unreal. When\ncharacters were killed I felt no connection due to the weak acting.\nJennifer Lawrence didn't seem to be in the right place while filming.\nThe story was so convoluted and the visuals became the only reason to\ncontinue on. $200,000,000 and this is what they create. They need to\nget some new talent injected into this franchise. When I heard people\nat the end gasp, \"oh my God\" about Jean being alive...what did they\nexpect? All the X-Men would be alive due to stopping the assassination\nwhich thus stops the Sentinels from being created. After seeing Rogue,\nStorm, Beast...why not Jean? Couldn't they have tried harder? 15,000\npeople involved with that much money focused could have really made a\ndent in cancer research rather than another clich\u00e9d film.\n"},

{"review": "\nX-Men - Days of the Future Past excels in every aspect. It has a clever\nstory (which is a hard thing to do in a time-travel movie), superb\naction and suspense. Basicaly it is a mixture between the Terminator\nand Matrix, our heroes try to manipulate the past in order to achieve\nsome better future for the almost-extinct mutants and the oppressed\nmankind. And the future is grim indeed, and visually fascinating. The\nmutants have been hunted down because Homo Sapiens in its fight for\nsurvival in the evolutionary process managed to create super-robots\nwhich are able to confront superpowers. The battle scenes between the\nSentinels (robots programmed to hunt down mutants) and the remaining\nX-Men are stunning. X-Men are facing a lost cause and that way we have\nsome real suspense on the screen. In every battle before, ordinary\nhumans have been only a cannon fodder, but with the sentinels all bets\nare off. As for the time travel story, our remaining heroes sent\nWolwerines conscience in his young body to try to prevent the creation\nof super robots and perhaps to save a soul of the shape-shifting mutant\nRaven/Mystique. The story background in the seventies is very cool and\nof course it is a good thing that we have some different languages in\nthe movie. I always found irritating that in the most movies we don't\nhear foreign languages, but have bad English with a foreign accent.\nNacis are best example for that.

Anyways\nWolverine is once again the main main main character who goes back in\ntime to guide the younger Professor Xavier. Kind of like how Xavier\nguided Wolverine. The movie is called X-Men but the story mostly\nfocuses in on Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto and Mystique. You do see the\nother mutants use their powers, but it doesn't play the main key parts\ninto this movie. My main complaint with Wolverine in this, is the fact\nthat he doesn't have his Adamantium claws so you won't really see him\ntearing crap up. This movie let's say is a refreshing start to a new\nbeginning...Maybe. My favorite part in this movie is the Quicksilver\nscene in the kitchen.

Middle age must be about to catch up with Hugh Jackman, but he's\nstill a hunk. We mostly see the younger versions of Erik and Charles\n(Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy), but Patrick Stewart and Ian\nMcKellen pop up from time to time to add a bit of gravitas. Mark\nCamacho does a great job of recreating Richard M. Nixon, that most\ndevious of presidents. There's a welcome surprise appearance at the\nend, and the suggestion that messing with time really does have\nconsequences.<br><br>DAYS OF FUTURE PAST really raises the bar on sequels and remakes.

His outing as Bolivar\nTrask the major bad guy was perfect, and it's good to see him do stuff\noutside of Game of Thrones. <br><br>The movie does not fully pay attention to the continuity of all the\nfilms, but what's good about time travel is that it sets everything in\nplace. Now we are fully completing with the Marvel cinematic universe\nover at Disney. Can't wait to see X-Men: Apocalypse now. <br><br>You got to see this one.\n"},
{"review": "\nA phenomenal addition to the X-Men movie collection. It was nice to see\nso many of the characters we grew up seeing in the comics make\nappearances in this movie, even if they were briefly shown. It's nice\nto see Beast in the picture now as well. <br><br>I give the casting director two thumbs up on his casting of Evan Peters\nas Quicksilver. He played the part perfectly and I really don't think\nanyone else could have done as well as he did. <br><br>Though the story was twisted a bit from the original comic book\nstoryline, I think the sequence of events that took place and how it\nall connects was just outstanding. A very well written script and very\nwell designed scenes. As always, the graphics were superb.<br><br>10 stars to Days of Future Past and I cannot wait to see the next one.\nThe teaser after the credits is worth waiting for.

{"review": "\nAfter seeing this movie I tried to compare it to others I had seen, as\nI often do. I usually find most of the ones I watch to finish somewhere\nbelow the traditional greats: X2, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2,\nAvengers, Superman...until now. I'll have to see it a few more times\nbefore the novelty wears off but that may have been the best superhero\nfilm I have ever seen. And I stress the word \"film\" because that's the\nonly way I can describe a movie with so many emotional beats, such\nstrong subtext, so many layers, so much complexity and so many gut\nwrenching moments.<br><br>From watching Mystique review autopsy files, to painfully watching the\nX-Men graphically die in a lynch mob of Sentinels can not be describes\nin comparison to other superhero movies. They felt less like scenes\nfrom another cape-inspired summer blockbuster and more like scenes from\nSchlinder's List.<br><br>The movie also does an excellent job of being an allegory for racism;\nthe trump card X-Men holds over all other heroes. It means something.\nUnlike Batman who is a rich playboy, or Iron Man who is a rich playboy\nor Spider-Man who is a broke supposedly hard luck case who none the\nless bags tons of pretty ladies, or Cap who is a universally loved war\nhero, the X-Men are outcasts. As the movie so perfectly depicts,\nthey're lives are not perfect. These characters don't fall into normal\ncaricatures of \"good\" and \"bad\". Everyone is a mix, everyone is broken.<br><br>There's no pretty girl for them to impress, most of them are not\nsurrounded by wealth and all of them are normal faces who blend into\nthe crowd but are not part of the crowd. The movie makes you feel truly\nsorry for that.<br><br>There is no superhero formula in this movie. The good guys don't\nnecessarily \"win\", the bad guys don't even \"lose\". Even with a future\naverted, the future still is not set. And it leaves you with the\nfeeling that maybe this never ends, and there is more to come. Much\nmore.\n"},

{"review": "\nDefinitely the best comic book adaptation with avengers right behind\nit. From the beginning it makes you feel like the world has actually\nbeen destroyed and the 3D is definitely worth the money. The concept of\nthe sentinels copying mutant powers made them so much more interesting\nand gave some really good effects and fight scenes. The new mutants\nthat were introduced e.g Sunspot, Bishop, Blink and Warpath weren't in\nthe film a lot but they'll obviously be introduced in the next film\nwhich is obviously Apocalypse. The film also erased everything done in\nx-men last stand which was awful and you could really tell that Bryan\nSinger was back giving us the best film in the trilogy. He brought the\nold cast and the new cast together really well and I'm not sure whether\nthis was Stewart or Mckellen's last film but I wouldn't be too bothered\nif it was because James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender do it so well. <br><br>Overall the film had EVERYTHING I wanted from it, even small things\nlike quicksilver hinting his relation to Magneto and loads of other\nthings that only fans of the comics would understand. The after credit\nscene gave us a little insight to the next film and it was exactly what\nI was expecting. Can't wait to see the next.\n"},

The\ncharacters introduced were memorable, the villains felt invincible and\nyou really feared them and for the Xmen. <br><br>If you like action films you need to see this, if you like hero films\nthis is the best hero film since Avengers.

{"review": "\nWolverine gallops through time and space to deflect an ugly outcome for\nall of humanity, pausing frequently to give old cast members the time\nto wink directly into the camera and strut off set. I'm somewhat\nashamed to admit I thought it was a rather large mess. The story had a\nlot of potential, especially in the unusual settings of both timelines,\nbut it somewhat predictably gets tangled in the tripwires often\nassociated with a time travel flick and spends far too much time\ndelivering fan service when it should've been examining character\nmotivations and further world-building. Trask and his sentinels barely\nplay a supporting role in the proceedings, patsies at best, and I'm\nstill struggling to comprehend Magneto's decision-making in the third\nact. It retains all of the unease-inspiring puns and goofball moments\nthat I'd hoped the series could shed, making it feel dated and slightly\npandering... a significant backtrack from the progress made in First\nClass. Even the built-in fireworks of the two heavyweight casts meeting\nface-to-face doesn't really work as well as it should. Seeing the new\nguys (McAvoy and Fassbender) alongside the old guard (Stewart and\nMcKellen) didn't result in a torch-passing or spotlight the nuanced\nefforts that had so delighted me in the previous picture, it just made\nme yearn to see more of the senior guard. I mean, it's not all bad -\nthe effects work is wonderful, it's a lot of fun spotting all the\nlittle love notes scattered about for hardcore fans, and the action\nroars along for a two-hour candyland cruise - but I had trouble\nshutting off my brain when earlier chapters hadn't been nearly so\ndemanding in that department.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was a huge disappointment for me because it felt like a\nfiller movie (A movie that is not needed/created just for monetary\npurposes/contributes nothing to the story of the preceding movies) The\nmovie had great visuals and seeing all the mutants together in the same\nfilm was amazing, but that is not why I see movies nor do I encourage\nanyone to do so.<br><br>I enjoyed The Wolverine movie, but did not enjoy this. Sitting through\nthis movie felt like a chore. Several parts were not needed and it felt\nlike it was dragged on way too long. I think the part where Magneto was\nmoving the stadium was dragged on far too long. Parts like these make\nme believe that if Wolverine was really time traveling during a battle\nthat he would easily be captured or killed considering how long he was\ntaking. I understand he was not time traveling in another part of the\nuniverse like in the movie Interstellar so the time should correlate\nwith the present time.<br><br>The other parts of the movie I did not like were how the movie\npresented the mutants as arrogant a-holes that have superpowers. They\nwere so arrogant that they didn't even have sympathy for a fellow\nmutant. I understand that this was before the Xavier's School for\nGifted Youngsters, but still is this the only two things the mutants\nhave in common with each other?\n"},

Not to exclude the rest of the cast, this rivals The Dark\nKnight franchise with a thriller like mentality that you won't wanna\nmiss on the big screen.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had been looking forward to this movie for a long time. The previews\nmade it look so epic and it turned out just so so. I personally think\nFirst Class was superior. I know a lot of people are bashing Brian\nSinger just to bash him but the man ruined Night Crawler and I really\ndon't think he should have been a part of the film and I would have\npreferred it if they had just pretended like the earlier Xmen films\nnever happened and completely started over. They could've still used\nPatrick Stewart and the other actors but just abandoned the story\nlines, which I guess they kind of did.<br><br>They didn't do a very good job of connecting things. There are far to\nmany inconsistencies to list. I think what aggravates me most is how\ndid they fail to tie in the post credits scene to The Wolverine with\nit? I can understand having trouble with movies released almost a\ndecade before they knew they would need to tie things together, but not\nwith a movie as recent as Wolverine. They seriously made James Mangold\ndrop Wolverine receiving his mask and gloves so they could include a\nscene that doesn't even make sense.<br><br>I wanted to see Wolverine take out one of the Sentinels but they made\nit impossible.<br><br>I like Jennifer Lawrence but she shouldn't have been the focus.<br><br>Magneto gaining complete control of the Sentinels was just stupid. At\nmost the railroad tracks he inserted would have simply given him\ncontrol of their movement.<br><br>How is Xmen Apocalypse going to take place in the 1980's if DOFP ended\nin the future? <br><br>I better see Rogue fly in the next one. Hopefully with True Blood being\ndone Anna Paquin will get more screen time.\n"}
