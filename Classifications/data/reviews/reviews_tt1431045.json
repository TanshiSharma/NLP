{"review": "\nFirstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading\nreviews with One Star because the movie had \"Foul Language\" and \"Sex\nScenes\" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate\nfor their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of\nresearch you could have determined if this movie was for you or not\nWith that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and\nwriting were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are\neasily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie\nfor you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for\n2 straight hours you will love this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nAt first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to\nit being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show\nup, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent\nyears. <br><br>The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In\ntypical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in\nDeadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from\nthe serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like\nfeel, in a good way.<br><br>Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then\nsaving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero\nfilm. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the\nfantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain\nsilly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times\nin my SECOND watch). <br><br>As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements\nwere well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important\nin understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee\nfor movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made\n"},
{"review": "\nLet me say at the very beginning of this review, I loathe super hero\nmovies. I can not stress that point enough. For me, watching anyone of\nthe countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios in\nthe name of entertainment over the past decade is, for me, akin to\nhaving teeth pulled. Painful to say the least. My friends however are\naddicted to every single bombastic franchise, and through sufferance,\nI've endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet more\nLycra-clad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat (there are\nof course exceptions to the above; 'The Dark Knight', the original\n'X-Men)<br><br>I was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watching\nDeadpool would be an excellent waste of my time. I envisaged 15 minutes\nof feigned interest, followed by an hour 45 of updating my email and\nsome cheeky online shopping. Well that new Morphy Richards kettle and\ntoaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold, shock\nof all shocks, this film is bloody marvellous!! Bloody, hold your\nknickers cause they are about to get blown off, marvellous!<br><br>The dialogue is witty, sincere, and delivered by every single actor\nwith a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius,\nthan drab scripted nonsense.<br><br>The pacing of the movie is excellent. It held my interest through its\nentirety.<br><br>The actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned director.<br><br>I was so pleased that for once, I was being forced to watch a movie\nthat treated me like an adult, with adult humour and themes, made for\nadults. Not for grown children masquerading as adults.<br><br>This film is a perfect storm! Just everything is right! I look forward,\nto my great surprise to any squeals!\n"},
{"review": "\nLet me just say off the bat that I liked this movie overall. The action\nand the humor were both very good, and Ryan Reynolds nailed the role of\nDeadpool.<br><br>With that said, Deadpool, the infamous anti-hero known for constantly\nbreaking the 4th wall and just overall being unconventional, is stuck\nin a way too conventional movie that doesn't take enough risks.\nDeadpool in this film is very much himself, and there's plenty of\nR-rated humor the usual PG-13 Marvel film tries to avoid, but in the\nend, the film gets bogged down by a typical 3rd act finale (the weakest\npoint of the film), another forgettable Marvel villain in Ajax\n(possibly the worst),plus the typical supporting characters like the\nlove interest and goofy sidekick. It's all a little too conventional\nfor such an unconventional character in Deadpool, and the movie\nsuffers.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with\nDeadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory,\nunnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy,\nwhere its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a\ncomedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this\ncharacter.<br><br>The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant\nto be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with\naction, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable\nfor children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on\ncomics are intended for children only.<br><br>Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far\nmore successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry,\nbut if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it\nwithout blood, than that movie will be all but serious.<br><br>That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and\ndirectors are too worried about political correctness in their movies.\nThat really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many\nmovies with great ideas but poor realization.<br><br>Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching\nit, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.\n"},

{"review": "\nI have to admit that I am a huge fan of Deadpool. After reading the\ncomics and trades, I was excited when Marvel announced that they were\nfinally going to make a Deadpool movie.<br><br>I had liked Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern but when I found out that he\nwas cast to play Wade Wilson, the merc with a mouth, I was one happy\nfangirl, and I have to say, he did not disappoint.<br><br>Marvel had fun with this film, all the characters were perfectly cast.\nIt was fun watching Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand)\ninteracting with Deadpool, trading snark for snark while Colossus\n(Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107 as the voice of Colossus,) is trying in vain to appeal\nto Deadpool's (better, saner?) side without success. Ajax and Angel\nDust (Ed Skrein and Gina Carano) were good strong villains but it was\nLeslie Uggams as Blind Al that really stole the movie.<br><br>The rest of the supporting cast played their roles well and created a\ngood strong background for the main cast.<br><br>It was also nice to see that Marvel finally got Deadpool's character\nright for a change and I loved the fact that Deadpool's constantly\nbreaking the fourth wall was included and a brief glimpse of Bob popped\nup to the delight of the audience.<br><br>The movie was filled with chaotic images and kept up a frantic pace\nthat suited the movie perfectly. The constant tongue-in-cheek\nreferences and humour kept the movie from becoming too dark.<br><br>All in all, Deadpool was a winner and I am looking forward to the\nsequel.\n"},
{"review": "\nOr maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel\nmovies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the\nX-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read\nthe comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my\nPlaystation. And I did think it was hilarious.<br><br>The \"wink wink\" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if\nyou like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening\ntitles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally.\nHe also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a\ntestament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this,\nleaving behind the \"shame\" of being \"green\" (another Superhero he\nplayed, not as successful, if you even can remember that).<br><br>Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will\nfind many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes\nguy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this\nanyway ...\n"},
{"review": "\nI walked into this movie with the hopes that Fox/Marvel would make this\nmovie not be like the trash fire that was Baraka from mortal combat\n(you all know what I am talking about). I walked out with a huge grin\non my face because I couldn't stop laughing the entire time. This was\nthe best way I could have seen Fox/Marvel apologize for their last\nattempt at the titular anti-hero. Firstly, Ryan Reynolds was terrific\nin the role, we all knew he would be, but this time he actually showed\nus that we were right about it. The costume was also great as well, the\nmain thing I liked about it was his eyes, and how they actually showed\nsome expressions and feelings while he was wearing it. The story\nhowever was very simple. While I am not trying to complain about it,\nfor it probably would have taken away from the movie if it was more\ncomplicated, but it was a very simplistic story with the same thing as\nyou would see in most movies these days. However, you will be\ncompletely distracted from that with really cool action scenes and\nhilarious scenes. This movie really is hilarious and you won't stop\nlaughing throughout the entire film. The action scenes are also really\nclever. This movie isn't just chop chop here, shoot shoot there, but it\nactually goes about how Deadpool would actually handle it. There is a\nscene in the movie where he chops off a guy's head and kicks it like a\nsoccer ball into another guy, now that is really cool. Overall, this\nmovie while it has its faults, you don't ever notice them because of\nthe humor, action scenes, and the amazing performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have seen a lot of marvel movies,but I'm going to be honest,I have\nnever seen a marvel movie that was rated r and I was actually pretty\nshocked.I saw the trailer,I never knew what dead pool was before. Then\nI saw the movie and i was dying laughing from the entire film. It was\nway beyond any type of marvel movie. However,it was funny and action\npacked;only this time,it had that adult touch to it.There was lots of\nthings a marvel movie shouldn't have:it had sex,nudity,lots of\nlanguage,graphic and bloody violence,and just basically any adult movie\nwould have. While I was watching the film,I learned a lot of what dead\npool was before I even read the comics. I learned that he was,at first\na cancer patient,then he went to some secret facility to cure his\ncancer,but instead,they were tortured him until he couldn't feel any\npain. Although,he has done more than avoid pain:he basically became\nimmortal. He couldn't feel pain,like literally nothing at all. He was\nan ugly disfigure who just wanted to be normal,so that's why he wears\nthe red suit(which he made).He wanted his face fixed and his woman\nback,but some bad guys take his girl and now he faces them,he gets his\ngirl back,but they don't fix his face. So he lives the life as a person\nwho doesn't care about anyone,but kills the people that mess with him\nand his woman.I also learned that he is part of the x-men movies,even\nthough he doesn't join the x-men in his movie. HE is also a loud\nmouth,which makes his enemies mad. So yeah,I learned a lot,I had a lot\nof laughs from the inappropriate humor and also the bloody\naction,because I just love action when people are fighting and I just\nlove this movie and it was a really great start up for a 2016 marvel\nfilm\n"},

{"review": "\nSo Deadpool , a character which was butchered in X-Men Origins but here\nhe is again taking the stage all by himself.Its so funny ,explicit,\nhumorous and hit all the right chords of an R Rated Comedy about a hero\nwho definitely kills more than villains.

Where was he all those years ago? His\nportrayal deserves him an Oscar but academy.This film from stating the\nfilm's cast and title till the end credtis roll is a full on laughter\nride.I mean this is the film that makes fun of the x men timeline and\nstates that's confusing.This is the one that points out that the\nXavier's mansion blows up in every x men movie.I will not go further on\nthe story though since you should watch it and be surprised but I can\ntell you every thing u loved or hated about a superhero movie is being\nlaughed at in this flick.go and watch\n"},
{"review": "\nThe idea of making an R-rated superhero movie is good and I think it\nshould be a trend but this movie is not a very good example.<br><br>A few scenes did make me laugh. I liked the action scenes.<br><br>However, one problem I have with this movie was that it was trying too\nhard to be funny. Some of the humor was just ridiculous and very bad\ntaste. Examples would be the scene where Ryan Reynolds farts and the\nscene close to the ending where Ryan Reynolds was lying next to his\nlover Vanessa as he was still fighting Ajax, he made a hole with his\nfingers and stuck a finger in the hole as a sex joke. Also the scene\nclose to the beginning of the film where Ryan Reynolds had a hole right\nin the center of his ass on his suit was just childish.<br><br>Another problem I had with this movie was that Ajax was just not an\ninteresting villain. He tortured Deadpool, fought him, kidnapped\nVanessa, fought Deadpool again, and then got shot in the head at the\nend. For a supervillain, Ajax didn't do much. And the movie never\nexplained how Ajax got his super strength.<br><br>My last issue with this movie is the fact that Deadpool was played by\nRyan Reynolds. He is like Jackie Chan, Danny Trejo, or Adam Sandler,\nyou can't take those guys seriously, especially after Ryan Reynolds was\nin that horrible Green Lantern film in 2011.<br><br>Hopefully, the sequel will have better humor and villains.\n"},
{"review": "\nA lot of superhero movies favor special effects over character (I'm\nlooking at you, Avengers), but perhaps because Deadpool had a\nrelatively low budget for this sort of thing - something I only know\nbecause I read it on wikipedia - this movie is full of character. The\nprotagonist is a vengeance seeking madman constantly breaking the forth\nwall, his best friend is a hipster bartender who gambles on his brief\nlongevity, and he and his girlfriend (the ridiculously attractive\nMorena Baccarin) engage in the dark clever banter you'll love if you're\na fan of the series You're the Worst).<br><br>Deadpool proves that giving your characters personality does not mean\nyou can't also have great action scenes, such as the crazed one that\nbegins the movie (and clarifies the funny and perplexing title\nsequence). I found the action in this movie far more exhilarating than\nthe bigger-is-better approach of some movies (I'm looking at you again,\nAvengers).<br><br>Overall, this is as fun and funny as Guardians of the Galaxy and has\naction as memorable as that in X-Men: First Class. Ryan Reynolds\nbeautifully plays Deadpool as a psychotic version of Spider-Man, and\nreally, the whole cast is excellent.<br><br>This is a sort of tangential X-Men movie, but it still exhibits a lot\nof what makes that series the best of the Marvel universe.\n"},
{"review": "\nOut of all Marvel movies made, Deadpool was the worst. The main\ncharacter talks too much it became very annoying after 5 minutes. The\njokes were not funny.

It\nreally shows that the studio had no budget for many characters, but\ninstead they invested a lot in the slow-motion special effect, which\nwas cool.<br><br>In terms of story-line, there's no story. There's no character building\nas well. For about 2 hours, all you can do is endure the horrible\nblabber mouth of the main character.

{"review": "\nOne word describes this movie - pointless.<br><br>Wow, this film was incredibly boring. People are hyping this movie over\nnothing. The story is so simple and boring. It didn't even feel like I\nwas watching a thought-provoking movie, more like a short and simple TV\nseries with an unfunny, forced and pointless main character on his\npointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains. <br><br>The X-men were pointless as well. They didn't add anything to the\nstory. They only assisted Deadpool with fighting the villains when\ntheir original goal was to have deadpool work for them. They happily\naccepted Deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them. <br><br>The only okay point in this movie was the action. However, the action\nstill could have been better as it felt very rushed at times, and at\nother times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography. It\ndidn't feel intense at all, more like you know the villains are going\nto fail very easily.<br><br>I also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to\nexplain the purpose of the weapon x program e.g. \"superheroes\",\n\"superslaves\" etc. What are these villains even doing? There was\nnothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains. The\nstory was lacking in too many ways. The world felt very empty and\nhollow.<br><br>Looks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would\nenjoy anything just because it is r-rated. That is the truth, that is\nthe only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of\n\"F\" words and other vulgar words, it has sex and nude scenes and it is\ngory and violent. None of this is new. Again, the Story and Characters\nare terrible.\n"},
{"review": "\nDeadpool is an outbreak in superhero film industry. When talking\nsuperhero movies, you expect movies stuffed with senseless action and\nviolence, an out-of-reach love story, or unnecessary vulgar language.\nDeadpool serves these aspects in a fine ratio, none outweighing the\nother.<br><br>The movie is a smart mix of explicit comedy, romance/drama, good\nstorytelling, directing, cast performance, visual effects and\nscreenplay. Watching the movie, hardly a scene went-by without\nlaughing; even the vulgar language comes into context. The love story,\nalthough unlikely, but attractive.

A fan base so large in\nfact that 20th Century Fox was convinced (albeit begrudgingly) to green\nlight Ryan Reynolds, perhaps the film's biggest supporter, to take\nanother shot at creating more true to character version of Deadpool.<br><br>So what's the verdict on this movie? IT'S PERFECT! Everything that\nmakes Deadpool the dark comedy king of Marvel is here! He's cocky,\nhyper violent, self referential, clearly a little pissy about having to\ndrag Fox kicking and screaming into making this movie and is as nutty\nas an old school Bugs Bunny cartoon, you know, the good ones with all\nthe lovable racism.

{"review": "\nI'm reminded of Wil Smith in Hancock (2008) which was more of a\nsuperhero crime drama than a superhero dark comedy action as Deadpool.\nNevertheless, perhaps its the contemporary times of change and\nloosening of societal morals that the gutter talk of sex and swearing\nlike young boys and late night comics within a superhero movie was\ninevitable. While the dark humor is creative and at times refreshing,\nit really seems more like a stand up comic night with a lot of R-rated\none-liners. Even Deadpool noted the absence of a lot of superheroes in\nthis movie. The fusion of comedy, action, and then a severe transitions\nto romantic drama, along with the constant cynicism much better\npresented in Hancock, made for a jarring experience with a movie\nwithout a consistent tone. Along with a lot of Kill Bill death-dealing\nand death-defying action, this movie seems more like a testosterone\naction entertainment thriller for boys rather than anything really\nseriously award winning. The one redeeming element of the movie was\nRyan Reynold's delicate and remarkable performance.\n"},

They action sequences are great, its a non-stop\naction-thrill with a lot of blood, gore, violence, bad-language,\nnudity, toilet humour and virtually everything a hate-loving psychopath\ncould want. Great! It was fun and entertaining at times and if you\nnever get tired of constant violence, gore and cheesy humour and have\nnothing better to live for. Then I am sure you would love this movie,\nwhich takes movies like Sin-City, Kill Bill and Spawn and upgrades it,\nand makes super-hero movies like Spider-man and Bat-man look like a\nvegan dinner. So whats not to love?<br><br>A lot actually. To anyone who likes to eat anything other than extra\nspicy Bean Burritoes for breakfast, lunch and dinner the constant\nrepeat of same lame childish jokes combined with endless of pointless\nviolence gets pretty boring after awhile. There is virtually nothing\nnew or original for this movie to offer which has not been done many\ntimes before. Its definitely not a movie to with kids or anyone with a\nsensitivity level above that of a street thug, and I would not\nrecommend if for that reason. <br><br>Its the kind of movie which not only has the \"hero\" act and kill before\nthinking or asking questions, but it seems the movie makers and\neveryone involved with the movie did too. On a positive its kind of\nwhat you would expect looking at the trailer and don't disappoint in\nthat, but on the negative it doesn't offer anything more.<br><br>A well-done non-stop action movies for those who don't wish to think,\nfeel, create, change anything for the better or be surprised.

{"review": "\n\"Deadpool\" is a tiresomely unfunny stab at making both a superhero\nmovie and a parody of superhero movies that succeeds at neither. For a\nhuge budget superhero flick, the plot and scenarios are just way too\nuninspired and boring. It has a pretty good opening action scene, but\nafter that it has absolutely nothing you won't have seen before in any\nother recent comic book movie. For a parody, it isn't funny, and all\nthe nudge nudge wink wink moments get old in the first scene, and then\ncontinue all the way up to the inevitable after-credits-scene, which is\njust as unfunny as everything we've seen before it.<br><br>The movie seems to think that name dropping everything pop-culture\nrelated is funny by default. You leave, probably unable to remember an\nactual gag, but maybe some of the relentless name dropping is still\nwith you, by virtue of the law of averages. Reynolds, as Deadpool, even\nname-drops himself at one point, and not even that got a laugh.\n"},

I was honestly so\nuninterested in the protagonists that I did not care who won. I know\nthat deadpool is a funny character, but i was still hoping for grounded\nstoryline. The plot was all over the place and not intriguing\nwhatsoever. Some of the jokes were mildly funny; however, I found the\nmajority of the jokes too immature and frantic to be of any real\ncomedic value. They felt very forced. Furthermore, the humor was\noverall too childish and crass. I got tired of most of the jokes very\nquickly. Based on how this movie turned out, I would have preferred a\nPg-13 version similar to other x-men movies.

Everyone is losing their minds over\nthe film on social media billing it as the best film they've ever seen\never. I think its got something to do with 'breaking the fourth wall'\n(something Malcolm in the Middle did expertly), making jokes only funny\nin a 13 year-old boy's changing rooms, unnecessary graphic violence and\nnudity which is absolutely unnecessary... that is until you realise\nthat this film has been written by/for people who still think farts are\nfunny. The humour in this film isn't even as sophisticated as White\nChicks or Scary Movie. It's not a parody either. As an example, the guy\nbehind the bar delivers his lines like he's reading them for the first\ntime. No comic timing, no life, no urgency. That may be his character\nbut whatever comedy is supposed to be in his dialogue goes missing\nimmediately. They also take jokes too far. Sometimes, just leading a\nviewer into the realm of a joke is fine, leave them there, let them get\nit themselves - not Deadpool. It's like they knew people with the sense\nof humour of a 9 year old would be relishing every pointlessly gory\nbanal second and they not only explain the joke, but they keep talking\na good minute after the joke has been, gone and not been laughed at;\nstill telling the same joke. <br><br>In short - no, this is not the best film you've ever seen ever. For\nthat (in a comic book adaptation), go watch The Dark Knight or The\nAvengers. This film's storyline, jokes and content have all been either\nwritten by or for adolescent boys who still think 'boobies' are things\nto snigger behind your hand at at the back of a biology lesson.\nEveryone involved in this film needs to grow up and so do the people\nleaving 10 star reviews.

Quite simply put, the movie is\nterrible in every sense of the word.<br><br>Deadpool is untrue to its source material and to the very character\nhimself. The character is known for his violence and humor throughout\nhis comic book, TV show, and video game appearances. The filmmakers, in\ntheir apparent efforts to make the character more \"edgy\" and appeal\nmore to adults, have stripped him of this, instead replacing the comedy\nand fun with crude dialogue, sex, sex, more sex, and more foul words\nthan possibly all of Eminem and Lil Wayne's albums combined, and all of\nthis without any of the substance that have made Wade Wilson's\nadventures and misadventures alike over the years so memorable,\nexciting, and laugh-out-loud funny. <br><br>No wit, and no soul. It insults the intelligence of its audience, and\nthen expects them to pay. We've come a long way in terms of the quality\nof super hero films; to call this a step back could potentially be the\nbiggest understatement of the year.<br><br>For those who have been waiting for a good Deadpool film, this\nunfortunately is not it.

They both carry\nheavy burden and very lucky to find each other. There is not just sex!<br><br>The way Ryan talk to the 4th wall to make fun of X-men series, Movie\ncompany and even himself is just funny.<br><br>Most people may dislike this movie because the R rate expression and I\nagree too that this movie is definitely not for children or teenagers.\nIt still can't change the fact of \"Deadpool\" is a well making, ironic,\nentertainment movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nRyan Reynolds finally plays a comic book character that we was meant\nfor. After the disaster of Green Lantern, years ago, Ryan got his\nchance to play a role he was destined for.<br><br>As an R-rated film, and highly discussed by many about how \"this is not\na kid's movie\" the film is kind of tame in its uses of adult subject\nmatter. <br><br>It's a good story, about the vigilante / anti-hero Deadpool. It has\nstrong comedy elements, it plays out realistically, and it really works\nwell as a romance too. It hardly even feels like a comic book movie.\nI'm hoping the atmosphere of Deadpool 2 is similar. <br><br>Morena Baccarin was wonderful in the role and fits really well with\nRyan. Supporting characters of Colossus and Negasonic seemed forced,\nhowever, due to limited budget of licensing for more X-Men characters. <br><br>Most of the action sequences are fun but some people may not be able to\nhandle them very well due to the gore. Humor is very active in the\naction scenes and the film's R-rated content keeps light hearted. Aside\nfrom some of the kills in the film, the laidback feeling makes me feel\nthat the film is suitable for some kids (depending on age).<br><br>This was definitely the first must-see of 2016. Deadpool is a great\nfilm all around and should be seen by everyone, even if you're not a\ncomic book person.\n"},
{"review": "\nI understand it could of done better however, loads of people rated\nthis 1 star out of 10. Have you frigging seen the opening credits. That\nwas awesome. I mean \"starring God's Perfect Idiot\". That is awesome.\nThe cast was amazing, the flashbacks were good and this film had some\nfunny jokes. If you are over the age of 15 and have not seen DEADPOOL,\ni assure you, go and watch it. This film was awesome. Tim Miller, Ryan\nReynolds and much more help from loads of people made this film for a\nlong time. IT WAS WORTH IT. Colossus was amazing in this. Negasonic\nTeenage Warhead was brilliant. And the damn British VILLAIN was\noutstanding. I don't understand how anyone can really hate this. This\nwas a good success!\n"},
{"review": "\nI have to admit, I did chuckle a number of times during the movie's\nonslaught of nonstop jokes. However, that's really all the movie has\ngoing for it. The fight scenes are not involving (mainly because\nDeadpool is invincible and has a lackluster villain). The love story\ndoesn't really work either for such a violent character nor does the\nback story. Fox probably shoehorned all these elements that really drag\nthe movie down--the superhero movie clich\u00e9s--because even though they\nwere taking a risk in making this R-rated movie, they didn't want to go\nall out with it. All those clich\u00e9s really stand out against all the\nparts that do work because they are so lackluster. It felt like no\neffort was put into any of those areas mentioned above compared to the\neffort put into making the character as good as he was.<br><br>The potential is there to make a good movie in the future with Deadpool\nthough and given the massive box-office success the film was, I'm sure\nthe sequel will be better able to focus on giving us a plot worth\ncaring about and more innovative action sequences.<br><br>Add-on: Some of the jokes are very rape-y and off-putting.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis title knows what it's about. Unlike other marvel movies, this\nmovie keeps it low-scale, the plot is not over the top, and it keeps to\nits material. It is not too ambitious, and stays within reason.<br><br>The acting is quite good, the actor that plays Deadpool is so good at\nthe act, that it feels like they are almost the materialisation of the\ncharacter of the comics. The humour is on point, it does not feel\nforced, and it captures very well the kind of humour that the comic\nbook character has. And I am also a fan of how the Deadpool character\nrecognises that he can not be a hero, which makes him feel a lot more\nhuman, unlike a lot of superheroes that just jumps into this large\nresponsibility by the fact that they're powerful in itself.<br><br>The action and choreography is quite good, and the action scenes all\nwere appropriate. However I must warn for all viewers that the movie is\nquite bloody and contains a lot of sex scenes, and even involves\ndecapitation and depicts characters being shot.<br><br>My only complaint is that I am confused as to the role of this movie,\nand how it might play into the other marvel universes.<br><br>I would recommend it, as it is good for what it is, and deviates from\nthe typical comic book movie genre.\n"},
{"review": "\nDeadpool was an okay movie. It was definitely not great, as many would\nsuggest. It was very funny, but that is literally all that it had going\nfor it. The film was extremely anticlimactic - I found myself bored,\nmidway through. Also, the X-Men reference was so forced, I laughed at\nit. Deadpool was a filler movie - something to entertain superhero film\nfans, while they wait for the next blockbuster. I am a bit disappointed\nin myself for spending $4.99 renting it, On-Demand. The film felt like\nsomething you rent while hung-over, and - even then - that's not\nhelpful, because you still wake up, wondering why you have a boring\nmovie in your line-up. I would highly suggest that anyone looking for\nsuperhero fun go see X-Men: Apocalypse, which is an awesome film.\n"},
{"review": "\nDeadpool(2016) Starring: Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Gina Carano,\nT.J. Miller, Ed Skrein, Brianna Hildebrand, Jed Ress, and Karan Soni\nDirected By: Tim Miller Review You know I didn't think I was going to\nsee this movie because while I may be eighteen I have no I.D but\nluckily my father took me. Man I'm glad cause this is one of the best\nsuperhero films! Just not the best R-Rated one. Based upon Marvel\nComics' most unconventional anti-hero, DEADPOOL tells the origin story\nof former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, who\nafter being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with\naccelerated healing powers, adopts the alter ego Deadpool. Armed with\nhis new abilities and a dark, twisted sense of humor, Deadpool hunts\ndown the man who nearly destroyed his life. This is a comic book that\ndoes not acknowledge itself but damn as heck feels like one with his\nballs out their humor and crazy costumed hero. This movie was trying to\nget off the ground for years by Ryan Reynolds who felt he owed it to\nfans of the character to give them the Deadpool they wanted after\nrelentless backlash for both X-Men:Origins Wolverine and his Green\nLantern movie. He damn well did owe us and he delivered. It may be the\nmost fun I have had in a comic book movie but that doesn't\nautomatically make it the best, but it's one of the best, not better\nthan two films I could mention but the point is that you will fall in\nlove with Deadpool.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe new age of superhero movies shows how meta references and involving\nan expanding world of superheroes can create an entertaining flick.<br><br>Deadpool isn't an average hero who has noble intentions or wants to\nsave the world for the right reasons. <br><br>Deadpool is in it for the revenge and to make something out of his\nworthless life. I saw bravery and true potential from him in the start\nwhen he was willing to risk his life for a girl who's boyfriend\nwouldn't leave her alone. Most wouldn't care or get involved.<br><br>He undergoes experiments to transform his body into a super mutant, but\ninstead is betrayed by the mad scientist to become a slave. <br><br>While in not usually a fan of self aware films that pretend to be\nintelligent or witty yet this turned out to be a hidden gem.<br><br>Ryan Reynolds has come along way from being a pretty face and a one\nnote actor to be a leading man.

You don't get depth like that in super hero\nmovie or kick-ass.<br><br>Still it leaves the question on if Deadpool is gay, straight or bi\nsince some of the action or phases he sprouts are questionable about\nhis sexuality.<br><br>The final fight scene was magnificent and kept you guessing.

{"review": "\nI honestly think that if it wasn't for Ryan Reynolds, this movie would\nnot have received the high average rating it got on here. Ladies, (and\ngents), let's face it: if Deadpool was played by some average schmuck\nwould you really be giving this movie 10 stars, keeping in mind that he\ndelivers the same lines the same way? <br><br>Yes, this is a snarky movie and it's supposedly true to the original\nseries, but as a movie on its own it's just cringe-worthy. The jokes\nare funny-ish, the beginning is loaded with unnecessary sex scenes and\nshots of Reynolds' a**, and towards the middle I was falling asleep\nbecause it just seemed like the movie was all over the place and not\nreally going anywhere. <br><br>One of the most over-hyped movies this year. If you want a semi-love\nstory, action, snarky remarks and cheesy one liners, and of course\nbrief glimpses of Ryan Reynolds doing the nasty with a hot girl, yes go\nahead and watch this.\n"},

Finally someone that is not a product of the Hollywood\ncrappy world of Illuminati.<br><br>This \"anti-hero\" is exactly what I would be if in a similar situation.\nI might actually be even more crazy. This guy is simply not accepting\nthe weak-ways of the Batman, Superman and all the \"man\" series that\nfollow the laws so that the criminal can still get out and make more\nlawyers work. (Hey, even losers need money, the fact they use a\ndishonest job to get it is only part of the horror but then again, they\nare stupid humans!)<br><br>Deadpool, to me, is the REAL hero of Earth.

If you don't want violence watch the smurfs or Tinkerbell.\nThe comments from Deadpool made me laugh the whole movie, I like his\ndisrespect of the \"caped boy scouts\" which I agree with. (I loved the\n\"vulverine\" ones, it took me 5 minutes to stop laughing, it is so true!\nBig knives instead of fingers but cannot even scratch a villain! Wimp!\nFreddy Krueger was scarier and more efficient than Vulverine.)<br><br>To the people that did not like the movie I can say; stick with your\nTwilight crap!

{"review": "\nFirstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading\nreviews with One Star because the movie had \"Foul Language\" and \"Sex\nScenes\" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate\nfor their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of\nresearch you could have determined if this movie was for you or not\nWith that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and\nwriting were fantastic.

I\nthink the film is a bit overrated giving it an 8.2 on IMDb I think at\nleast give it an 7.3 instead just because some of the sexual scenes are\na bit too much. <br><br>I do like this movie as it is one of my favorite SCIF but The sex\nscenes where a bit too much <br><br>overall its a great film if you don't take it too seriously 7/10\n"},

{"review": "\nDeadpool is easily the most fan service of comic characters, so it\nmakes sense that his big screen spotlight is a movie that feels a fan\nservice movie. The \"merc with a mouth\" is a character that doesn't take\nhimself seriously and neither does his big screen adventure, which is\nthe biggest appeal of an otherwise standard super hero formula hiding\nunder waves of winking irony, crass humour, and gleefully bloody\nviolent mayhem.I'm pretty sure this is my new favourite Marvel movie\n(alongside 'The Avengers')Whether or not you are a fan of this style of\nhumour is one thing, but this film as a whole, is fantastic.The concept\nof superhero fatigue only exists when films begin to bleed into one\nanother, without even a modicum of originality or creativity. Deadpool\nis the outsider the genre desperately needed -- a hysterical exercise\nin separating itself from the pack with no 4th wall in sight and a\ntitular character that offers more heart than anyone would have\nanticipated.\n"},
{"review": "\nWas A pretty good movie. Just wish the studios would make up their\nminds about how they want the characters to look like and keep it they\nway and at the same time keep it close to the original comic character\nas possible.

I\nhope they get it right in the squeal. But over all was a decent movie.\nJust sucks that its rated R for people with kids who like X-Men. And\nWolverine 3 is supposed to be rated R also.
