{"review": "\nWell, I just saw Avatar this morning, one of the press premieres which\nare running on these days. My opinion: you've seen this story a hundred\ntimes, but never like this. Finally 3D is what it's supposed to be, an\ninstrument at the service of the movie. You'll enjoy the visual\nexperience, no doubt.<br><br>As for the story, some of the \"inspirations\" are so huge and so obvious\nthat mentioning two or three of them would REALLY ruin the movie for\nyou, and I'm not willing to do that. Lots of mysticism and ecology, if\nyou like that stuff. If you're 15 or so, you'll have a great time\nthinking that it's the first time somebody makes something like this.\nIf you're an experienced movie watcher, better leave your skepticism at\nthe door, bring lots of pop corn and enjoy with the usual\naction-flick-with-moral-and-loads-of-clich\u00e9s.<br><br>I liked it, however: \"the movie that re-invents movies\"??? No way.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had the rather intense privilege to view James Cameron's much\nanticipated $400 million budget return to the directing scene, Avatar,\nat the Empire Leicester Square in London.<br><br>Where to begin! The visuals in this pieces was groundbreaking. He did\nit with the Terminator series and then Titanic, so one would expect\nCameron to deliver... and HE DID! The visual are by far some of the\nsharpest CGI I have seen. You could almost say that there is a disquiet\nthat follows Cameron's soul, as there is no other possibility of this\nstrong and intensified quality. Its production design and visual\neffects are both noteworthy and it will get its praise upon official\nrelease.<br><br>What it was lacking that really should have shaped the movie is its\ncharacter/story. I was expecting a complex and believable plot, but was\nleft with a movie with mostly strong visuals. What most sci-fi lovers\ndesire is mind-bending philosophies, fantasy and exploration and\nlimitations of our or outer species. If it was not for this factor, I\nwould give this a 9.5 vote.<br><br>Avatar will be a success, not only because of Cameron's legacy, but by\nvery intelligent and viral marketing. Avatar have had a powerful\nmarketing technique that assembles other successful blockbusters, such\nas The Blair Witch project (you all remember it), The Dark Knight\n(Joker invades the world) and also, the current production The Artifice\n(the-artifice.com) that is intelligently targeting the market.<br><br>Kudos to Cameron, Avatar is one of the (if not The) movie of the year.\nI could get in trouble for sharing this with you guys so early, so\nplease click Yes on \"Was the above comment useful to you?\" as a thank\nyou. ;)\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London, which\nis a superb venue in which to view this film. Huge screen, excellent\nsound and an extraordinary Dolby, 3 dimensional image. The whole effect\nis mind blowing.<br><br>This is a 'Must see' movie, innovative, and extraordinary. I think it\nwill be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the\nhistory of the art. The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and\nalthough the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it's\nexcitement and holds the audience's attention to the end.<br><br>Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on\nbig star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and\ndelivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But\nas there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human\nelement does not dominate in the usual way.<br><br>As Writer/Director, James Cameron deserves high praise for this\ncreation and in my opinion it will break box office records. I\nthoroughly enjoyed this film.\n"},
{"review": "\nA film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be\na risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's\neconomic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only\ntime can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it\nbeing an artistic triumph.<br><br>Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an\nalien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and\nincredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually,\naurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the\nshow. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this\nnew world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before\nwe see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop\nand ILM have truly outdone themselves.<br><br>Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart\namongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an\nimpressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though\nthe characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they\nmanaged to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the\nspecial effects.<br><br>That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and\ndare I say, clich\u00e9d and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in\nall forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper\nthin. The love story, while charming, is also clich\u00e9d despite being\nbetween man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is\na success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.<br><br>Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly\nwhat cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems\nand worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will\nundoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for\nthe foreseeable future.<br><br>9.5/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI have never been so close to leave the movie theater, as i was when\nseeing Avatar. Sure, it's very beautiful to look at, but, if you've\nseen the trailer, then you've seen the movie! It's basically every\nmovie clich\u00e9s put together in one horrible and so unoriginal movie.\nit's a mix of the \"last samurai\" meets \"Pocahontas\" meets \"Atlantis\"!\nit's by far the most horrible storyline since Ed Woods' \"plan 9 from\nouter space\".<br><br>Not once are you surprised by the turn of events in this movie, and\nthere's so many bad movie clich\u00e9s in it, and so many things that just\ndoesn't make any sense at all (even in their universe). for example,\nthe last fight scene with the giant robot and the Avatar. It really\ndoesn't make any sense at all, that the robot is carrying a 8-foot-1\nhunting knife, just in case he loses his gun (which could easily have\nbeen attach to the robot!), and that the robot tells the avatar, what\nhe's about to do, instead of just doing it (A good example of a bad\nclich\u00e9).<br><br>If you want to see this movie, i recommend you either see the trailer (\nas that is enough for you, to litterily, call every scene in the movie)\nor you go out and buy Atlantis and just Imagine it with smurfs instead\nof underwater people.\n"},
{"review": "\nI realize I am probably going to get flames galore for this comment,\nand you all have the right to your opinion about my opinion, but hey,\nI'm entitled to my opinion too. Avatar is grade A crap. That's right,\nit's crap. I say this for one simple reason: Without the special\neffects this movie would never, ever captivate and take a hold of\naudiences like it has in the past week. Ask yourself this one question:\nIf it didn't have the effects, the Navi plugging their hair into the\ntrees like it's a damn broadband jack, mech suits(just like the ones in\nMatrix Revolutions) and barely futuristic ospreys, would you care about\nthis movie at all? It's a truism when they say this movie is nothing\nmore than Dances with Wolves in space. Some people may argue back that\nStar Wars borrowed from Hidden fortress, but at least it had enough\ncompelling plot points to make it look different, such as I don't\nknow... the force? The Death Star? Outer space? A location that has\nNOTHING at all to do with Earth? This important set of points clearly\ndifferentiates Star Wars and Hidden Fortress. But The difference\nbetween Avatar and Dances with wolves is... CGI. This CGI may be pretty\nbut it cannot ever substitute for story and plot development. Speaking\nof, the characters save but a few are either very bland or stereotypes.\nThe worst part is the story and the movie gives us no reason to care\nabout the characters. You know what? I'll go one step further and say\nthat the only difference between Avatar and a Star Wars prequel is\nthis: Avatar has an environmental story that we can relate to. That's\nit. True, the action scenes in Avatar are well done, but hell, the\naction scenes in the Star Wars prequels were also arguably well-done.\nStill, there's that nagging lack of story development. Avatar is a huge\nlet-down and doesn't belong on the best-of list of anybody with common\nsense.\n"},

{"review": "\nAt the risk of repeating what countless others have said, this movie is\nblatant plagiarism. If a film student submitted the Avatar screenplay\nto an instructor, he/she would have been given an F. Colleges expel\nstudents for less obvious ripoffs than this. If you've watched\nPocahontas or Dances With Wolves, you know the drill. The only\ndifference is the ending, which has the pretty blue humanoids escorting\nhumans to their Earth-bound ships at gunpoint, which I freely admit is\na rather neat sight since my ancestors were American Indian, Irish, and\nScot. As a result, I am perhaps overly sensitive to the plight of a\ncivilization driven from their homeland and/or oppressed by a\nconquering nation - er, planet.<br><br>However, originality is not James Cameron's strong suit, so my\ndisappointment is directed more at WETA. Yes, my beloved WETA, who\nimpressed me throughout the years but completely stole my heart after\nthe masterful rendering of all things Tolkien in the Lord of the Rings\nTrilogy. I had two reasons for seeing this film. One was a 13-year-old\nboy, the other was my anticipation over what wonders WETA would lay at\nmy feet.<br><br>Now, had the budget not been nearly half a billion dollars, I'd have\nunderstood the cartoonish creations, but as it stands there's no good\nreason for the results. Viewers are praising this film as\nrevolutionary. I call \"horsesh!t\". This was nowhere near the caliber of\nWETA's LOTR work, their King Kong work, or their X-Men work. In fact,\nit wasn't even up to snuff with their Narnia production. The quantity\nof work was greater, not the quality.<br><br>I've never reviewed a film in my life. I actually registered here for\nthe sole purpose of expressing my resentment at having wasted $20 bucks\nand 3 hours on such nonsense. Booooooo.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst I didn't want to go watch Avatar because when I heard Cameron\ntook 3 weeks to write the plot I said to myself there is no hope for\ncinema anymore.

How does he feel about filling his\nbrother's shoes? Twin relationship? The conflict between scientists and\nthe military is not developed. Every supporting character was a stock\ncharacter.

{"review": "\nI had high expectations going into Avatar. Now I admit, it's probably\nstupid to go into any movie with expectations that are too high, lest\nthey be crushed.

The story\nis very predictable, and as I watched this movie I was overcome with a\nfeeling as if I had seen this all before in something in a made for TV\nmovie on SyFy. This is pretty bad considering this is the same guy who\nmade The Abyss and Terminator.

Character development was even worse in this movie, as EVERY\nSINGLE character in this movie is flat,not a single one qualifies as a\nround character.

If you watched\nDancing With Wolves, which is my favorite movie by the way, you know\nwhat I am saying. Avatar is just a sci-fi version of Dancing With\nWolves, and of cause a much worse version of that. The story is weak,\nthe characters are weak, the idea is weak. After 5 minutes you already\nknow what is going on in this stupid movie, and you don't need to be a\nhardcore movie fan to predict the ending of this movie.

Actually what makes me really\ndisappoint is not the movie itself, since there are lousy movie all the\ntime, but the high rating on this movie. IMDb indicates people's favor.\nAnd I think Cameron fooled people once again. He leads movie this great\nart to a lower level not higher. It is so sad. Actually I have to say,\nas a thief (he stolen whole story from other movie), Mr. Cameron used\npeople, wasted people's time, and even worse he made young director\nfrustrated by the Hollywood movie law--high costs equals great movie.\nUnarguably, movie is visual art, it has to be beautiful. So it is\nobviously correct that more technics should be used in movie to make it\nmore visually beautiful. But if the visual beauty is the only thing\nleft in a movie, I have to say, it is not a movie, it becomes a screen\nsaver. So what is the point of a hollow beauty?

{"review": "\nI want to start this review with the note that this is my first review\never,i did not write one until now because i am a critical person and i\nhave not met a movie yet which moved me so deeply that i felt the need\nto write a review. <br><br>I saw today Avatar in 3d with some friends,i went to the movie knowing\nit has nice effects and visuals but with no big expectations, i do not\nknow if i have ever been more surprised in my entire life , this movie\nhas absolutely incredible breathtaking visuals.And here is the good\npart,it does not only deliver images which you could watch for days\nwithout a break,but the story is also intense and well written.When\nJake Sully takes control of hes avatar for the first time i almost\ncried, if you are a sickly person like i am,never been able to do\nsports or enjoy runs, then those moments will deeply move you,he\ndevelops so much joy and fun running around ,breathing deep, feeling\nthe nature ,it takes you in ,and makes you want a new body. Throughout\nthe movie i cried ( and i am 22 years old), i laughed ,i had shivers\nrunning down my spine,i had so much anger i nearly stood up and punched\nsomebody,and at some scenes my heart even skipped a few beats,which\nnever happened watching another movie before.This movie just overwhelms\nyou with emotions.<br><br>The outcome of the movie makes you seriously think about us people\n,about our lives and how we treat the nature and animals,about our\nbehavior as mankind,we enjoy killing and destruction instead of\nrespecting ourselves and others and the world that surrounds us. I\nrecommend this movie to anybody,especially those people who can\nunderstand the deeper meaning,it is very likely that this movie will\nstay with you for the rest of your life,and its sure that this is one\nof the best movies ever made.\n"},

He has directed some of the most influential and amazing\nfilms of the last twenty years some examples being The Terminator and\nTitanic. Avatar has now come to take it's place in such high rankings.<br><br>Watching Avatar is like being on a roller-coaster ride that you just do\nnot want to get off of. When you see it you'll know what I'm talking\nabout. With all of the action, sorrow, romance, and the fight to just\nbe there is absolutely no way that you can't enjoy this movie.<br><br>Avatar tells the story about a man named Jake that lost his legs while\non duty in the military. Now he travels to the world Pandora on a\nmission that could help him get his legs back. He is on a mining world\nwhere what they are digging up is worth a lot of money. However, the\nnatives of Pandora are called the Na'vi and their home is on the site\nof where they're trying to mine and that is where Jake comes in. His\nmission was to get them to relocate but in time that starts to change.\nHe uses an avatar (a body that looks like him and Na'vi as well) he\nuses this body to communicate with the Navi. While he is under their\ncare he falls for the princess of the Na'vi. As he feels more at home\nwith them the sooner he realizes that he must make a choice to side\nwith the humans or the Na'vi and find his true place in life.<br><br>Avatar is probably the most amazing film of not just the year but the\ndecade.

{"review": "\nWell, I'm going to have to give this movie a full rating because it\nreally lived up to my expectations.<br><br>We have here a science-fiction epic set on an alien world. It's a\nclassic story of a \"good-guy\" hero who must overcome a battle within\nhimself to do what is right.<br><br>Although the movie doesn't exactly have the biggest twists, turns, or\nsurprises, it simply sets out to do what movies like \"Star Wars\" (the\nones in the 70s, and 80s, that is) did... to stun us a little with the\nlatest in special FX, give us a classic \"Romanesque\" story, and enchant\nus with a very creative world. This movie did what it set out to do,\nperfectly... and maybe even a little better than perfect.<br><br>The world is so detailed, and rich. Every animal looks as if it is\nreal... and everything just matches and seems convincing. The\n\"humanoid\" race that inhabits this world is very interesting, and the\nway the world works \"together\" is amazing. This may be one of the few\nsci-fi adventure movies where the computer animation actually works in\nfavor of the storyline. Animals and beings do not look like animations.\nThis realism, this pushing of the limits, is what science fiction is\nall about.<br><br>But you obviously cannot have just a beautiful movie without no\nstoryline or character to back it up. There is a lot of character in\nthis movie. All of our human characters, the alien race, and the\navatars all equally have great character. And the storyline, although\nnothing extraordinarily original, is chiseled from \"classic\"\nstorytelling. Good versus evil... doing what is right... all spun\nneatly together.<br><br>What a wonderful escape this was!

All the backlash from the first teasers were\nforgot within the first 30 minutes of viewing, and I'll never listen to\ncritics in the future ever again. How wrong they were. Sure there were\nelements of other films like Dances with Wolves, but I saw greater\nconnections with the Final Fantasy VII game. I'm not even prepared to\nsay that the comparisons are a bad thing, as this film (in my opinion)\nis greater than anything it will be compared to. A bold statement I\nknow.<br><br>Now Pandora is a world needed to be seen in 3D, I'm sure the 2D version\nwill be a great movie, but you won't feel like you are actually there.\nThe realism in the visuals is far greater than anything I have ever\nseen, the CG characters make Gollum look like Roger Rabbit. The world\nappears real like our own and you connect and feel for the place and\nits inhabitants towards the end. I really wanted it to be as real as it\nseemed.<br><br>If you are familiar with the plot, you will be please to know that any\npolitical statement made, its not one forced upon us throughout, its\nsubtle, but the message is clear. As the audience, you are allowed to\nforget about our own world troubles and be part of an amazing adventure\nthat will stay in your mind for a long time. Bravo James Cameron.\n"},

For\nperformance I would love to take two names: Sam Worthington and\nMichelle Rodriguez.. Both were superb in their roles.. Sam's simplicity\ninitially will take you as a surprise and watch out for his performance\nduring the fight sequence as a Na'vi.. He will surely walk away with\nloads of accolades.. Cinematography is pragmatic and enigmatic.. VFX\nand Graphics used are marvelous.. James' Direction is humongous superb\nand breath taking..

{"review": "\nAt first, I was rather skeptical of the movie, I heard Avatar and\nthought 'The Last Airbender'. Then I saw a trailer and became enamored\nwith the movie. Then, when I went to see the film, it lived up to my\nexpectations and them some. Granted, the plot is not the strongest\nfeature of the movie, but it is there and it makes everything flow\nalong nicely. The important characters get plenty of screen time and\nare all pretty likable, especially the main antagonist, Colonel\nQuartich. Okay, maybe likable isn't the right word, but he's cool. And\nextremely BA, because who would kick out an airlock to shoot at people?\nOr barely reacts to being on fire? Anyways, none of those people are\nthe real star of the show. The world, Pandora steals that title. It's a\nrich, alien world that will be a feast for the eyes. The wildlife is\nfamiliar in concept, but completely alien. Also, one last thought.\nWhile the wildlife looks absolutely amazing, so does everything else in\nthis movie. The machines, the Na'vi, the world, the people. All of it\nlooks fantastic. And, shell out the extra money to see this in 3d,\nignore the headache, and prepare to be amazed.\n"},

What Cameron and his team\ncreated was more than a movie -- they created an experience, one that\nshouldn't be missed. If you miss out on this movie, you miss out on\ncinematic history. The world that Cameron and his team created is one\nyou may never want to leave. I didn't feel the nearly 3 hour length of\nthis experience -- to me, it breezed by.

{"review": "\nLet me start by clearing a few things up. Avatar is the kind of film\nyou have to see in the cinema to enjoy it fully ( and in 3D if\npossible). I was lucky enough to stumble upon the film a few months ago\nand foolishly dismissed it. Then two days ago me and a few of my\nfriends were on our way to see 2012 and got stuck buying food and so\nwere very late. We decided to skip 2012 and go see Avatar instead.<br><br>A full 165 minutes later I walked out of there fully convinced of that\nJames Cameron is a certified genius. The amount of detail in the world\nthat he has created for the Na vi (the blue people) is astounding. The\nlevel of colour and detail draws you in like nothing I have ever\nexperienced and the 3D really is incredible.<br><br>Now the main point the critics of the film focus on the storytelling\nand its slow pace towards the beginning . Now not only is this an\nunjust and misleading comment but it is a total lie. The film sets up a\nbeautifully crafted story that demonstrates the power of human emotion\nand what happens when we loose site of it. There was not a single\nmoment in the film where I was wondering what was happening or why and\nI doubt that any director could fit such a breathtaking story into\nanything less that 2 hours 30 minutes. It once again proves Cameron\ncreative genius and gives us a terrifying insight into the path that\nhumanity is taking and what we will become. He has always tried to\nhighlight this in his past films with Carter Burke in Aliens and\nCaledon Hockley in Titanic, both portraying the bastard capitalists.<br><br>There are very few things that can be leveled against this film but I\ndo not believe that I can think of any. In my view Avatar is not just\nthe best film I have ever seen but the best cinematic experience I have\nhad in my 15 years in this world.\n"},

{"review": "\nTerminator, Titanic, these are the names everyone have heard of. What\ndo they have in common with Avatar? An avangard director by the name of\nJames Cameron. This was my first IMAX 3D experience and this turned out\nto be a visual extravaganza. In recent past, Hollywood has produced\nsome stunning movies in the genre, and we knew something great is\ncoming, and this movie shows how far we have come; this is what we had\nbeen waiting for. This is the benchmark of the 21st century\naction-adventure-sci-fi experience. The movie is about Jake Sully (Sam\nWorthington), a paraplegic marine, who travels 4.4 light years to come\nto Pandora, under the banner of Avatar program. Pandora a lush green,\nlow gravity moon of Polyphemus, inhabited by hominoid race called\nNa'vi. A Na'vi is nine feet tall, have bones reinforced by naturally\noccurring carbon fibre, have bioluminescent blue skin, big eyes, small\nears and a tail. They live in harmony with nature and worship a mother\ngoddess called Eywa. Members of Avatar program have successfully\ngenetically engineered human-na'vi hybrid knows \"Avatar\", that can be\nremotely controlled. Jake's mission is to infiltrate the Na'vi camp,\ngather Intel and reconcile a treaty with them to move their camp, which\nhappen to be resting on large deposit of \"unobtanium\", the reason for\nhumans to come to Pandora. Failing to convince the Na'vi's and\nsimultaneously falling in love with them, their culture and a Na'vi\nname Neytiri (Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a). When Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang),\ndecides to go all weapons free on Na'vi population, Jake sides with\nNa'vi's to give them an edge in the \"battle of bows and arrows against\ngunships\". The visual effects in the movie are truly groundbreaking.\nThe movie is interesting, entertaining, emotional, and action packed;\nan overall awesome performance. Animation, characterization of Na'vi\nand other Pandora creatures are by far the best I have seen. A must\nwatch. Treat yourself by watching it in IMAX 3D.\n"},

And that is\nsomething rarely achieved in such absolute beauty, beauty that leaves\nyou walking away from the theater, wanting to return the next day, and\nthe day after that. I have never felt so good after watching a movie, a\nmovie that holds such beautiful magic, since the original star-wars\ntrilogy came out back in the 70's and 80's.<br><br>The film ends leaving you wanting more, it starts by slowly enticing\nyou, then gradually building up into one heck of an adventure, rolling\nat such a speed that you'd never think it would end, but films end\neventually, and I just hope that we are given more in the future, so\nseriously, enjoy the power of seeing it for the first-time, watch it\nwith a fresh-mind, an empty bowl and zero distractions because the\nworld of Pandora awaits, the trip of a lifetime to an alien world\nbeyond your imagination!\n"},

The humans\nassume they know better, assume they are superior, and ultimately play\nthe part of well, human beings, exactly right.<br><br>There are scenes within AVATAR that depict a destruction of a beautiful\nworld, and I literally had to hold my hand to my mouth for some of them\nin horror. In fact, a number of times I surfaced from my stupor and\nfound my mouth gaping, along with my sister and all the rows of people\nnext to me.

{"review": "\nI must admit I had my doubts about this movie when I saw it in previews\na couple months ago. I really didn't know what to think of the movie\nthen. I saw this movie twice, the first time in regular 2d and the\nsecond in 3d. I have to say I was simply astonished at the visuals in\nthis movie. Some scenes do tend to \"pop\" out a little more than others,\nbut I was simply transfixed and awestruck not only at the incredible\nlook of the movie but of the storyline itself. This movie really makes\none think about life and how we might not be the only ones in the\nuniverse. Science fiction usually brings about thoughts on this, but we\ndo have the \"Kepler probe\" already out there looking for another\nhabitable planet, that isn't science fiction but is a reality. This\nmovie also brings up another incredible aspect humans have struggled\nwith. Humor me and go along with me for a minute - If a hundred or so\nyears from now the human race had actually found another habitable\nplanet and there was a less-advanced civilization living on it. Could\nour race be civil and humanitarian on the ways we try to establish\ncontact? Would establishing contact really be the best thing to do?\nThis movie might also seem quite similar to the early colonizers coming\noverseas from Europe to North America. Where the humans symbolize the\nprospecting company and the natives symbolize the Navi. This movie\nreally does have a lot more going for it than just stunning visuals.

Although stone-hearted critics (like the\nones on here who gave it a 1/10) may argue that it was unoriginal and a\ndirect copy of other movies, there are very few movies coming out\nnowadays that you couldn't say that about. I noted themes in this from\nseveral different movies, the most prominent being Dances with Wolves,\nbut that wasn't the only one. It also took a theme out of real life:\npeople destroying the environment for such petty things as money. The\nreality of it is one of the most disturbing things in that film.<br><br>Third: the storyline was great. It does have similarities to Dances\nwith Wolves, but there was so much more to it than that that you really\ncould not say they were the same thing. Dances with Wolves did not go\ninto the training nearly as much as this did. There are several others,\nbut I won't name them all.<br><br>Basically, this film is about as epic as you can get, and shame on all\nof you who think it was bad because it took themes from other movies\nand enhanced them. You will never find a movie that doesn't.\n"},

I kept wishing that this movie would turn out to\nbe good, but then I soon realized how predictable it really was. I\nfigured out what would happen within the first hour. I couldn't even\nsit through this movie again even if I was getting paid to do it. Blue\ncat people? Really? They connect to things with their hair? What kind\nof stuff was this director smoking and how do I get it, because this\nwas pure crap wrapped up in some pretty wrapping paper with a nice bow\nthat smelled like bile. How come, half way through we hear nothing of\nthis rare rock crap that the government is hunting for? They discard a\nlot of things in this movie pretty quick and then it becomes some\ndramatic romance between some crippled guy and a blue cat lady. I still\nwish I could get my money back and I didn't pay to get into this movie.\nThanks a lot Avatar for killing some of my brain cells and stealing\nprecious hours of my life that I will never get back. Don't watch this.\nDon't even rent it. Don't even look up pictures of it on the internet.\nI swear, your IQ will drop.\n"},
{"review": "\nThat a film so overwhelmingly lacking in originality, thought and\nintelligence could become such a blockbuster is perhaps the most\ndamning indictment of humanity since the holocaust. The fact that I\nwatched this in 3D does little to ease the pain of sitting through what\nseemed like an eternity of despair. I can quite honestly say that I no\nlonger fear the concept of spending an eternity in hell because after\nwatching Avatar it would seem like a holiday.<br><br>Avatar is a terrible film that quite honestly should insult the\nintelligence of everyone. To call it heavy-handed, bloated and mindless\nwould be a compliment.

But, like a middle aged woman with no\nlife watching Oprah, he develops a boner for their pseudo-spiritual\nmumbo jumbo and decides to help them against the big bad earth marines\nwho seek to plunder the environment mercilessly for their own gain.\nAlso, occasionally spacetwigs look like they are slightly closer to you\nthan they should because of the amazing 3D effects! I give Avater a\nrating of 1/10 because quite frankly I cannot go into negative numbers\nand I guess that rating can be justified by the one and only original\nelement Avatar provided.
