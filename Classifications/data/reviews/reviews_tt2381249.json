{"review": "\nI'm a fan of Tom Cruise and really like the last movie in the franchise\nbut I couldn't get over the feeling that I'd seen it all before. Every\nhair raising stunt, every corner Ethan Hunt is backed into you just\nknow he's going to win. The movie itself was good but for me it seemed\na little stale. The action sequences were huge and impressive but it\njust seems that Hunt is indestructible. He can ride one of the fastest\nsuper-bikes in the world and crash without a helmet and the guy doesn't\neven get a gravel rash! I know other people are loving it so don't let\nmy lack of enthusiasm put you off going to the cinema to see it. It's\ncertainly worth the ticked price.\n"},
{"review": "\nQuite predictable, pretty unrealistic and still very enjoyable. That\nbeing said, this movie is everything you can expect it to be. Quick and\ninteresting action and even if you can predict what's gonna happen next\n(sometimes precisely to a second) you still will enjoy seeing how they\nmade it happen. As for acting: Rebecca Ferguson's lovely, Simon Pegg'g\ngood, Ving Rhames Jeremy Renner and Simon McBurney are adequate for\ntheir characters, and Tom Cruise... well he's the way he is, if you\nlove him you'll love him here and if he annoys you... ;) All in all\nit's an action movie and if that's what you expect than you surely\nwon't be disappointed.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is another decent addition to the Mission Impossible series but it\nwasn't one of the best. It's missing the two most important\ningredients:<br><br>1. Interesting characters, especially bad guys (think Vanessa Redgrave\nin MI or Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI3). I hate to say it but Tom\nCruise is easily the best actor in Rogue Nation.<br><br>2. Thrilling set-pieces (the break-in scene from MI, or the skyscraper\nscene from Ghost Protocol). Rogue Nation's underwater security hack\njust didn't quite cut it for me.<br><br>Aside from that, it is a perfectly good spy/action flick. The fights\nare good. Ethan Hunt and Lane (the bad guy) keep outwitting each other\nin a pretty decent plot.<br><br>But it didn't grip me like some of the other MI movies have.\n"},
{"review": "\nSaw the movie last Saturday, we both fell asleep during parts of the\nfilm. The length was too long and the dialog nearly incomprehensible. A\nterrible end to what was a good set of sequels. The opening scene was\ntoo staged and no clearly defined plot. Was that goof ball trying to\nopen the doors did he not know Russian and on a mission inside of\nRussia! Unbelievable to say the least and not suspenseful or exciting\nin any form. The dialog between actors was so stilted as to be boring\nwhich causes us to nod off more than once during the film. MI in the\npast were not only exciting but kept you in suspense until nearly the\nvery end, none of that this time around.\n"},
{"review": "\nMission Impossible: Rogue Nation Review This sequel of Mission\nImpossible was no different from the others in terms of the plot. There\nwas no additional creativity and insight in the script. The plot was\nvery similar to all action/thriller mediocre films. The sequence of\nevents was above average but not as expected for I got bored in some\nparts of the movie. Many of the events didn't make any sense. The\nacting in the movie was good to very good. The characters were very\ngood and suited the poor plot. The character development however was\ngood to very good. The editing, soundtrack and special effects were\nmore than excellent. There was a very good degree of positive messages\nand an above average degree of positive role models. The ending was as\nexpected and we didn't see any twists throughout the film. Though there\nwas many things that could really improve the movie was an enjoyable\none and was worth watching.<br><br>Quality: Good. Rating: 32%\n"},

By the way, I recommend an aisle seat close to\nthe nearest exit. Makes your getaway that much easier. <br><br>Not much to say about the movie itself -- because there isn't much\nthere. A series of ego set- pieces for you know who, some touristy\nscenes for you know who, a chance for you know who to display his\nentire range of emotion from A to B, you know who gets to play dress-up\nand finally, you know who saves the world from\u0085 <br><br>Well, you know who ALWAYS saves the world. <br><br>On the other hand, looping this movie will make for some mighty potent\ntorture sessions.\n"},

IMF isn't interesting. The first half was\nokay, but it soon degenerated into mediocrity. Too many characters, too\nmany locations; no central focus or essential core. It wasn't really\nabout anything. And the end; what a cop out. The writers just had to\nfind a way to finish it; it felt rushed. I was bored with this film; it\nreally wasn't great. And like MI:3 the music sucked; just noise\npollution. Were any of the Mission Impossible movies ever that good? I\ndon't think so. Just another movie to soon be forgotten about.

And have to say I don't see the difference between the two: the\nscript, the humor, mindless dialogs, big-budget action scenes, constant\nrunning and overall intellectual level. Except that Spy is a parody.\nNow really, how did they manage to act *in this* with serious faces?<br><br>I know it's too much to ask for believable fighting scenes, or\nauthentic emotions, or at least a bit of irony.

{"review": "\nEthan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise, is back at it again. This movie was\ninteresting, but not quite satisfying.<br><br>The timeline of the movie was disappointing. The opening scene should\nnot have been the biggest stunt scene of the movie. That had set\nextremely high expectations for what was going to follow. But the\nremainder stunts and scenes of the movie were not anything that\nspectacular.<br><br>There was one scene that was catchy in a way. The car chase did not\nhave any music playing as it was happening. This I actually enjoyed\nbecause it drew more attention to the details of the car chase.

{"review": "\nShort version: Was it good? It was. Did I like it? Not really. The\nauthors of this movie went the easy way. If it worked before - just do\nthe same thing again. This movie features a rehash of facility\ninfiltration for the first one, bike chase from the second one, masks\nusage and Ethan dying from the third one. There wasn't that much\noriginal content or memorable scenes, and overall movie felt like a\ngeneric MI sequel. On the contrary, I still remember the incredible\nskyscraper climbing scene from MI:GP, that was amazing. The script was\nquite decent for a MI movie though, it has some turns, quite\npredictable though. The acting was OK, but Ilsa felt like she was in\nthe movie just for that extra woman eye candy. The funniest thing in\nthis movie is product placement, there was a ton of it, like really A\nLOT. A portion of it was packed into consecutive scenes, it was like -\nNOKIA...OK...XBOX...OK....HALO 5...DELL...BMW C-C-C-COMBO!

{"review": "\nIf talking about this movie alone I would give a higher mark probably 7\nbecause the excitement it brings, but under the title of Mission\nImpossible series, it is just not that good.

It becomes\na simple and funny action movie with a lot of flaws. Stories are told\npainstakingly even lack of basic logic flow between scenes.\nImaginations simply run riot and I was just looking for fun while not\nbeing persuaded at all.

{"review": "\nAn adequate actioner but not well connected to the earlier movies in\nthe series. And aside from a hair raising opening airplane takeoff, the\nstunts are witless. Cruise is getting some Eastwood about him and he\nlooks physically unwell, and can barely swallow some of the worst\ndialog of the year on hand right here... care of McQuarrie, whose\nabilities as a director outshine his writing disasters. The storyline\nis almost incomprehensible; when there is no humanity in the\ncharacters' behavior or motivation, then all one can do is sit back and\nview the film as a roller coaster ride; equal parts excessive movement\nand unpleasantness. The Ilsa character is typical... more of a plot\ndevice. Acting is OK, uneven; Jeremy Renner cannot overcome his\ncharacter's illogic and has the worst lines; Rebecca Ferguson adds life\nto the movie; the rest are negligible including over the hill action\nstar Cruise, who should be playing the Alec Baldwin part so step aside\nand let a new generation take over that part.\n"},

As soon as the actions come on, the way she acts, the way\nshe moves then comes her classy English accent, I could not take my\neyes off her through the entire film. She is so hauntingly sexy. What a\nperfect cast! Really, Tom Cruise did us proud by casting Rebecca\nFerguson. Perfection! I also thought not only Rogue Nation using the\niconic scene from Casablanca from the same name Ilsa to her timeless\ndress as a fashion statement from the 40s, Rebecca Ferguson also looks\nso much resemblant to Ingrid Bergman.

Well,\nalmost. This time actors do not play at all, except for Pegg. Simon\nPegg is the only main actor who performs and does his job great. Cruise\njust pull one of the two faces.

As one IMDb user put it,\n\"This is what an action film should be.\" The fight scenes were\nfantastic, the chase scenes were flawless, even the part with the cargo\njet, if you would consider that a chase scene, and the story-line and\nplot were good too. I read one review that said, \"Seen it all before\",\nwhich that might be the case a little but it's a \"Mission: Impossible\"\nfilm. They're agents dealing with the bad guys who are trying to take\nthem out. Still this \"Mission Impossible\" film, so far, is the best and\nI'm waiting for the next one to come out.\n"},

Now, the few action scenes are\nabsolutely fantastic and continue the over the top signature that Tom\ncruise and the Mission Impossible franchise have established but there\nare a lot more 'spy scenes' this time around: Rebecca Ferguson plays a\nvery ambiguous / mysterious character, there is some political\nintrigue. Overall, though I understand the disappointment of some\naction lovers the story is not bad or simplistic. It's of course not an\nphilosophical study of human nature but it's actually well done and\nwell told. My only gripe with the movie is the lack of the obligatory\nMission Impossible tropes: where is the scene where Tom falls from high\nabove to a few millimeters from the ground?

I would suggest\nwatching this movie as the plot keeps together mostly and actors keep\nwell in the movie. Also there is not to much stalling in the movie so\nmost of it sticks together towards the end.

The\nspectacular action scenes. Id like to start by saying with Tom Cruise\nthe majority of the movies he does are really great, and he gives it\n100% each and every time. mission impossible is one of the very rare\nHollywood franchises that actually gets better with each new sequel.\n'Rogue Nation' may not be as fun as the past films 'Apparition\nProtocol', yet it's an exceedingly decent action, adventure film. The\nfailing in the movie, if it can be called that, is the predictable\nplot. Great action sequences, especially those which involved suspense\n(loved the opera scene).\n"},
{"review": "\nIt took me ages to write this review because there are no words for how\namazing this movie is. It is action packed from start to finish, has\nlaugh out loud moments and makes you pray for a 6th instalment. <br><br>The thrill ride starts from the opening credits and the famous theme\nsong begins, even that was enough to get me pumped up and ready for the\nmovie.<br><br>So let's recap, why is it so amazing? Tom Cruise is hanging off a plane\nfor crying out loud!!!! Simon Pegg is HILARIOUS and gets a bigger chunk\nof the action this time too and newcomer Rebecca Ferguson is nothing\nshort of BA. If you're considering seeing this film, just do it! It's a\nthrill ride and keeps you wondering, what will happen next?\n"},

{"review": "\nReally awesome movie!<br><br>At first, I was afraid that the plot would be cheesy, as a lot of these\n\"impossible\" action movies are. But the plot made sense. The\ncinematography was excellent, and the writers threw in a lot of funny\nmoments as well.<br><br>As for the action scenes, well, they were superb. <br><br>It was nice for me, who is more conservative, that there wasn't really\nany sensual scenes, which would've been very easy to add in. <br><br>All in all, it's an excellent highly-entertaining movie that is well\nworth watching!\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Mission: Impossible \u0096 Rogue Nation\" is the best Summer Blockbuster of\nthe year. Very fun, entertaining, tense and has Wit. It's a film of two\nhalves. The 1st half it has all the great action sequences and the 2nd\nhalf it's a battle of wits and has all the spy espionage stuff. Tom\nCruise proves once again why he is an Icon. By doing his own stunts and\nalways being charismatic and likable. Rebecca Ferguson who played Ilsa\ndeserves major praise. She was a legitimate Bad Ass female. She was\nable to be tough, mysterious and alluring and still maintained her\nfemininity. She wasn't some skinny actress beating up men twice her\nsize. She actual took quite a beating in some scenes. She was easily\nthe best female character of the whole franchise. The Villain wasn't\nvery complex but he did do some despicable things so you wanted to see\nhim get his Ass whopped. Overall it's everything you want from an\nAction movie. Run like \"Tom Cruise\" to the Cinema to see it. 8.5/10\n"},
{"review": "\nFANTASTIC! Great movie!!! I don't have much to say other than it's\nEASILY the BEST MI since the first one came out.

He, as Ethan Hunt, also does\nhave the ability to outsmart an opponent when in desperate time and\nmeasures of need.\n"},

I hope director make them Love each\nother, a least even a Fling.<br><br>Many new gadgets doing awesome things ,.. script of Ethan Hunt vs.\nEnemy spy leader was good.

{"review": "\nThis is how a modern action flick with High-end gadgets, future\nweapons, supercars, daredevil stunts &amp; a perfect cast should be. As a\ndie hard fan for solid action movies, by the end of the movie the\nsatisfaction that I had gained was tremendous. Be it the storyline,\nperformances or the jaw-dropping stunts &amp; action sequences, every\nlittle actions scene kept the audience at the edge of their\nseats.Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, is undoubtedly one of the most\nexciting films I've enjoyed this year so far.

{"review": "\nPlot as follows- An International Rogue Organisation emerges known as\n\"Syndicate\" with highly skilled operatives who are dedicated in\nestablishing a new world via an escalating series of terrorist attacks,\ndue to this IMF is disbanded. To eradicate the Syndicate, Ethan Hunt\nmust find a way with the help from his team and joins hands with Ilsa\nFaust. The Fifth installment of this franchise is little bit better\nthan its predecessor in the form of story, more ark towards the\ncharacter of villain(better villain then Fourth one). Rebecca Ferguson\nas Ilsa Faust, the British Agent nailed each and every scene on her\npresence on the screen even gave tough competition to her co-actor Tom\nCruise, is great as usual performing stunts by his own for fans at that\nage(52 yrs) is totally Mind- Boggling.Simon Pegg is good in his comic\ntiming. With great action sequences(the bike chase sequence- one of the\nbest i have seen) and good screenplay which hooks and thrills the\naudiences till the very end. i am gonna give \u202a#\u200eA\u202c- to this \u202a#\u200eAction\u202c\n\u202a#\u200eAdventure\u202c \u202a#\u200eThriller\u202c \u202a#\u200eMuvi\u202c\n"},
{"review": "\nA few things... Too much Tom Cruise Too less Jeremy Renner/rest of IMF.\nIMF was just a name, it was more like Ethan Hunt and his bitches. Also,\nthe antagonist was almost not there in the movie. Such movies require\nan intimidating presence of the main villain but here Solomon Lane was\njust a name that was apparently \"too evil\" but was hardly there.\nAlthough Benji(Simon Pegg) got a bit of screen time and he did justice\nto it. Plot was similar to previous installments, IMF is disbanded, IMF\nmembers are fugitives, some syndicate group tries to terrorize the\nentire world, face masks and all the same stuff. However, the action\nwas impressive packed with very GOOD car chases and fast paced\nexplosive moments. In all, not a bad movie but not in the league of\nBourne series or Daniel Craig's bond movies. One time viewing is\nrecommended. 6.5/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI cannot rave about this movie enough. I left the theater wanting more,\nwhich we will hopefully get with a later installment :). Tom Cruise is\nat his best, believable and entertaining - and still looking buff and\ncute in his 50s! The plot was way more developed than I went into it\nthinking, with suspense and a lot of character development. I have a\nnew girl crush on Rebecca Ferguson and hope to see a lot more of her in\nother movies. It was great seeing such a strong female lead in an\naction movie that had more going on than just her looks. The team is\nall there as we love them, with lots of comedy intertwined.\nUnfortunately, Alec Baldwin got stuck with some corny lines but I will\nlet that slide since the movie was so great. <br><br>While there are plenty of action scenes for the guys, there is also a\nlot of substance for all moviegoers. I can't wait until the next and\nhope to see the cast continue to expand!\n"},
{"review": "\nMission Impossible-Rogue Nation is an action filled adventure that is\ngenuinely funny and gripping at the same time. The action sequences are\nexpertly shot(especially the chase scenes) and makes you feel like\nyou're in the movie. And while being possibly the most action packed\nMission Impossible yet, it is also the funniest(Benji is hilarious:)\nFrom beginning to end, the movie did not feel like it was too long and\nit kept you guessing until the end. The only criticism I have for the\nmovie is that the ending seemed rushed and the stakes didn't seem as\nhigh as in the last Mission Impossible. Nevertheless, Rogue Nation was\nmore fun than Ghost Protocol and is tied with the original(which I am\npartial to) as my favorite Mission Impossible. I would definitely\nrecommend this film to anyone looking for a good time at the movies.<br><br>7.8/10\n"},
{"review": "\nMission Impossible is getting better with every new addition to the\nfranchisee. Rogue Nation comes with an intelligent plot and great\naction stunts which are also believable at the same time. The under\nwater sequence is really breath taking one. It's total Cruise control\nand it doesn't matter whether you are a Tom Cruise fan or not, it's a\nmust watch for all action flick lovers. Even at the age of 53, Tom\nCruise has performed unbelievable stunts. Jeremy Renner is a great\nactor, so he deserves a bit more part to play. Simon Pegg has done a\ngreat job with his witty lines and by playing more integral role than\nthe last one. Rebecca was sexy and superb. Don't miss it guys !\n"},

I had an amazing time watching\nit on the big screen and will gladly confess - this mission more than\njust lived up to its reputation.<br><br>And Rebecca Ferguson - WOW! I am fumbling for words to describe her. So\ndeadly, yet so vulnerable. So lethal, yet so elegant! She's everything\nyou'll kill for! And, in my opinion, stole every single scene she\nshared on-screen. Simon Pegg was terrific as usual with his perfect\ncomedic timing.

{"review": "\nWe saw Rogue Nation last night. The 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes is\nwell deserved. The story has the usual chases, gun battles, and fist\nfights, but it's true strength is the battle of wits between Ethan Hunt\nand the evil villain. Even better than the good story, the amazing\naction, and Lalo Schifrin's music is the consummate performance of\nRebecca Ferguson as Ilsa. She is an Ingrid Bergman with dark hair -\nmaybe that's why her character name is Ilsa. And some of the movie does\ntake place in Casablanca. Believe me, I wouldn't mention Mission\nImpossible in the same sentence as the immortal Casablanca unless\nMission deserves it - and it does. In a summer filled with great action\nsuper hero movies - this one stands out.\n"},

I am not going to mention any specifics as\nyou have to see it to believe it. Must watch at the cinema if you can.\nBest movie this year, by far. There was not a single moment throughout\nthe movie where you can take your eyes off the screen. One final note\nfor those who reviewed it lower than 6 ( especially those 3's and 4's),\nyou guys want to really stop your illegal cam downloads and watch these\nmovies as they were intended to be watched.

{"review": "\nBy the time the fifth installment of a movie franchise rolls around,\nthat series starts to show its age. Not with Mission: Impossible, it\nseems, because Rogue Nation is yet another incredibly silly yet\nundeniably entertaining entry in the 17 year old franchise that keeps\nyou on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. This time around,\nEthan Hunt is now an international fugitive and must take on his most\nimpossible mission (heh) to bring down the rogue organization\nSyndicate, who are committed to bring down the IMF. The plot twists\nkeep you on your toes the whole time, and it's really what makes Rogue\nNation so thrilling. It does succumb to the normal spy movie goofiness,\none time in particular early in the movie that made me shake my head at\nhow ridiculous the whole idea was. The double, triple and quadruple\ncrosses get rather confusing as the plot progresses too. There's never\na dull moment in Rogue Nation, a suitably fun and over-the-top summer\nblockbuster, and it proves that Tom Cruise is an unstoppable action\nstar.\n"},

The only problem maybe is the duration.\nI think it can be little longer and the promotion of BMW can be\ndistracted sometimes No wonder as James Bond sequel did that too for\nAshton Martin Over all.

{"review": "\nI just came back from watching Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation, is\none of the best action films I have ever seen and I was so excited to\nsee my country in a Hollywood movie!

It's okay, but the thing is, that\nI know Morocco, and it is a beautiful country and it would be better if\nthey worked on the script to show Americans how Morocco truly is. One\nway would be by having the first scene in a beautiful urban part of\nMorocco and then cut away to the desert bike scene. Also, they named\nthe 3 most beautiful cities in Morocco, such as Casablanca, Marrakech,\nand Rabat, yet they only showed woven baskets being tumbled over by\ncrazy motorcycle rides and sheep. As a Moroccan living in the USA, I\nexperience many people asking me how it is in Morocco, and they most of\nthem think that is just vast amounts of desert area. This movie had a\nchance to do better in morocco . love the movie and i also love morocco\n"},
{"review": "\nI was indifferent whether I should give 8 or 9. Thats beside the\npoints. The movie starts very slowly with key characters in focus. And\nit takes a while before we get the understanding what the protagonists\nare after. Once everything is clear, it a game of cat and mouse with\nsome very emotional scene involving lead female character and very\nexciting and innovative action scene involving lead male character. At\none point, it was very dramatical and gave the illusion that both lead\ncharacter ( Hunt and Elsa ) have fallen in love, just like Sherlock\nHolmes and the Women in Sherlock Holmes TV series. At the half way, I\ngot a hunch that Elsa would die in the movie after fallen in love with\nHunt. But that did not happen.

{"review": "\nCrucial times lie ahead for the IMF as their superiors question whether\nthe agency is in fact an asset or a nuisance, and pressure is applied\nfrom bureaucratic CIA operatives who believe the agency should be\ndisbanded and absorbed. This puts veteran IMF agent Ethan Hunt in a\nprecarious position as he attempts a complex assignment to try and\neradicate the Syndicate, an elusive and international crime consortium\nwhose capabilities allow them to operate sort of like an 'anti-IMF.'\nWith time running short, Hunt recruits the few loyal members of the IMF\nto try and complete the task, with lots of unexpected surprises along\nthe way. The cast makes the most of the material but there are so many\ntwists, turns, double-crosses, and cover-ups\u0097which are intended to be\nslick and suspenseful\u0097but instead just end up dragging out the plot and\nmaking it a lot more convoluted than it needs to be.

{"review": "\nI loved Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation as much as the previous movies\nof the MI franchise. Thanks to Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie for\ngiving the audiences an action-packed, adrenaline pumping experience\nwhich included Tom's death-defying stunts like hanging outside an\naircraft and despite the risks, he pulled it off as usual because he's\na real actor who always gives 100 percent in every movie he does. The\ncast is amazing including Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames and\nJeremy Renner. Forget Bond and Bourne because Ethan Hunt is the best\nsecret agent ever. I give Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation 10 stars and\nlooking forward to see the sixth mission.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have always liked the Mission-movies: characters are elaborated,\nperformances are at least good, the script is frisky, the venues are\ndiverse and action scenes do not create blah! feelings... Of course,\nthere are lots of references to many other and more famous movies,\nincluding James Bond ones, but I like that the attitude/mood is non-\nserious, not \"bulked out\", even in respectable places like Vienna\nOpera... And inclusion of new and international actors, e.g. Jens\nHult\u00e9n, and places, e.g. Morocco, Austria, provides the movie with\nbroader background, bringing the viewers away from narrow despondency. <br><br>And - last but not least - all the cast is great again, even smaller\nparts are played with non-random performers. True, in my opinion, Tom\nCruise was overshadowed by Simon Pegg - but \"nerdy\" characters are\noften funnier than real \"actionists\"...\n"},
{"review": "\nTo say that \"Rogue Nation\" is the best entry in Mission: Impossible\nfranchise is to say a soft compliment.

I had the honor to see this outing at the cinema and it was\nmind-blowing. The action and the stunts are practical, without abusing\nCGI and so well choreographed that doesn't need to expand it all. The\nstory mixed the pace of the fourth installment with the suspense of the\nfirst one giving a perfect pay off in its last 30 minutes (full of\nbreathtaking twists and real surprises). Tom Cruise is at the top of\nhis game but the real standout is Rebecca Ferguson. If the next\ninstallments come as bright as this one I'll be delightfully.

It might be the enthusiasm Tom\nCruise brings to the table and therefor the talent he hires to keep\nthis on a top level.<br><br>The action scenes always were good, that doesn't change with this.
