{"review": "\n\"Gladiator\" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but\nmoving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score \u0096 it\nis truly a \"complete\" movie.<br><br>I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds\nme of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting\nportrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell\nCrowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts\nsuit them perfectly. There are also a number of less \"popular\" artists\nwho also deserve a big \"bravo\". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr\nUniverse Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the\nmovie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV\nStar and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is\ntotally brilliant and outstanding.<br><br>Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the\ninternet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was\nlucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese\nproduction. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but\nshe is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will\ndefinitely be seeing more of her work in the future... <br><br>The scenery used for \"Gladiator\" is brilliant \u0096 and the opening battle\nscene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera\ntechnique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions\nand blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks\nto the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal\nfeel to the entire movie.<br><br>\"Gladiator\" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received,\nand for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it \u0096 I can\nassure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and\nrent it now!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nMost films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be\nengrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than\nthe audience is lost.<br><br>Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and\nconvincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the\npeople that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors\ntoday, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.<br><br>Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most\nnotably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.<br><br>Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should\ndisplay, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map\nwith Gladiator.<br><br>But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences\nwhich jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true\nworth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these\ncompleted sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome\nscenes.<br><br>Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance.\nGladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant\ncomeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL\nMAXIMUS!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nOnce again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can\nbe. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent\nbuildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the\ngreatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military\ndiscipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a\nplace in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all\nthe beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography\nare just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it\nis present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us\nvisit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our\nhistorical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a\nway that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like\nscreaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the\nperformances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and\nactresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the\naudience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel\nCrowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising\nharvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well,\nyou\nshould see for yourself!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis is wonderful storytelling.  The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes,\nshowing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests.  I went back to see\nthe film again.  The first time I didn't hear anything Crowe said before the\nbattle.  I was just too visually caught-up.  The second time I listened very\nclosely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus \"what we do in\nlife... echoes in eternity.\"  Awesome.<br><br>A simple man v. an emperor.  I just loved the resilience Maximus showed\nthroughout the movie.  I find in most movies, there is an irritatingly slow\nprocess where the character has to \"find himself,\" not so with Gladiator.\nMaximus does what is needed.<br><br>I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film.  One was\nthe afterlife.  Aspects of the afterlife are opened, but not overdone.  Love\nof family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that\nwe see as well, although it may not be justly deserved, it is never\nquestioned.<br><br>The visual effects were amazing.  It actually had me wanting to believe\nthat's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory.  The battle of\nCarthage reenactment was really great.<br><br>The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply\nemotional.  The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are\ntelling him...you have arrived.<br><br>Bottom line: magnificent.  Visually and emotionally satisfying.\n\n"},

{"review": "\nAn intense Roman epic, a la \"Ben-Hur\" or \"Spartacus,\" it was nice to\nsee something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we\nhad seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.<br><br>Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything\nthanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek\nrevenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a\ntried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence\nas some of the other more recent epic films did, such as \"Braveheart\"\nor \"The Patriot.\"<br><br>The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has\nestablished himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix\nalso put himself \"on the map\" as an actor with his portrayal of the\nevil \"Commodus.\" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which\nmeans he's doing a good job acting.

{"review": "\nThere is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to\nmerely repeat its many deserved praises, all I can do is question a\ncouple of historical points.<br><br>It is unlikely that a Roman general would be sold into slavery and\nforced to fight in the arena. Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to\ncommit suicide to retain his property, most likely. <br><br>It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of\nall things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why.\nRomans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.<br><br>Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were\nbarbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating\nthe human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction\nexists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking. The bonding\nfeature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from\nthe 20th century German SS.<br><br>Great entertaining movie nonetheless.\n"},

Deeply violent, yet not one gratuitous drop of\nblood was shed, not one encounter without reason. A classically made film,\nand a beaut.

Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch\nit, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i\nreally liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end.

{"review": "\nI have had a great deal of discussions with people about this film. I\nagree it is a good movie. Its entertaining, action packed, worth the\nprice of a ticket. However, I don't think I have ever seen a movie win\nso many awards without questioning the validity. Gladiator, while still\na good film, is hardly deserving of all its accolades. I mean it might\nbe worthy of winning cinematography or production awards or special\neffects but Best picture? Best Actor? I could think of a 100 other\nmovies in the year 2000 more deserving than this movie. Don't\nmisunderstand, I like this movie, but the problem is that movie awards\nlike the Oscars,presumably, are there to honor high quality and High\nachievements in each respected field. Russel Crowe does an adequate\njob, but his acting in his other Oscar nominated films like \"The\nInformant\" or \"A Beautiful Mind\" were light years ahead of his\nperformance in \"Gladiator\". Furthermore, Giving best picture to this\nfilm was mind boggling.

Hey, remember that\n\"Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" was also up for best picture that year.\nIn my opinion, It ran circles around \"Gladiator\". Wheras \"Gladiator'\nwas just a good action film.

Actually, the movie begins with a battle\nbetween a Roman legion and a German tribe's army. Great shots! It is much\nbetter than the fights in Braveheart.\n The other impressive side of the movie is the consistency of the plot. The\nmovie has a coherent plot which sends us a clear picture of the happenings,\nwithout limiting the suspension. You cannot guess the end of the movie at\nall, and neither the next step, but as it happens it is\nlogic.\n The last but not least is Crowe's acting. I have never heard about this\nactor until this movie, but he plays very well. He is manly and sensitive\naltogether. I commend its casting, when other candidates were more\nknown.\nYou just have to see this movie, and you will be convinced that the great\nepic era of the fifties was finally reproduced and surpassed.\n"},

But one\nthing was still missing: a similar movie set in ancient times, that\nwould reinvigorate the sword-and-sandal genre by matching the epic\nvisuals of Ben-Hur with the new, grittier and more believable look and\nfeel.<br><br>Ridley Scott's Gladiator, a wonderfully written, timeless revenge story\nwith gripping performances from Russell Crowe, Richard Harris, and\nOliver Reed (plus Joaquin Phoenix, Djimon Hounsou &amp; Connie Nielsen),\nand accompanied by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's trend-setting,\nhaunting score, was that movie. It truly revived the genre and was\nquickly followed by a string of similar movies (out of which,\nunfortunately, only one - Wolfgang Petersen's Troy \u0096 measured up to the\nhigh standard set by Gladiator). It doesn't really matter that Ridley\nScott's movie is full of inaccuracies. It's thrilling, it's\nheartbreaking, it feels real. I have seen it countless times and it\nnever gets boring.<br><br>Note: The extended cut is even better than the theatrical version.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis has to be my favourite movie of all time. It's a classic. Russell\nCrowe's performance is out of this world and the award for best actor\nin that years Oscar was well deserved. He played the roll of a\nlifetime. What always fascinated me about going to watch this movie was\nI never watched one single trailer prior to going but was gripped from\nthe beginning The other character's are also extremely strong and the\nstoryline and pathway the film takes isn't something that hasn't seen\nbefore but certainly is moving and believable There isn't a great film\nwithout great music and Han Zimmer's score in this is arguably his\ngreatest work. The theme and variations are so strong and the attention\nto detail of the style that was necessary for that period is fantastic.\nIt's been 16 years since it came out and still has the same edge about\nit and that is the mark of a great film. You would happily watch it\nover and over.\n"},
{"review": "\nSo i watched this movie because it was suggested after watching 300\n(which i liked better to be honest) and at the beginning i liked it\nvery much, but the end was very predictable. One big disappointment was\nthe language. Before i watched this movie, i watched Narcos with its\nauthentic Spanish, Braveheart with this awesome Scottish Accent and\nInglourious Basterds with Brad Pitt and his cool Tennessee Accent. I\ndon't want to say that the whole movie should have been in Latin, but\nthis American English destroyed the whole atmosphere. I would not say\nit's a shitty movie, but in my opinion it doesn't deserve an\neight-point-five score.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once\nagain, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths\nof the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and\nsocial experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that\nall the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like\nscreaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out\nthe performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some\nactors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly\nable to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have\nguys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and\nextremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more\nfans around the world.\n"},
{"review": "\nI will start off by declaring that, IMO, this is the best film I've\never seen. <br><br>Why? Well, the reasons are many. First up, the acting is superb. All\nthe major players put in excellent turns, as do the bit-part actors.\nRussell Crowe will never inhabit another character the way he does\nMaximus. He looks like he was born to play this part. He presents us a\nman with immense charisma, authority, bravery, honour and dignity. A\nman prepared to die for what is right. Joaquin Phoenix gives us an\nemperor, Commodus, that is entirely credible: one minute, he's\nreasonable and lucid, the next, he is psychotic. Oliver Reed, in his\nfinal role, is an excellent lanista (director of a gladiator school).\nConnie Nielsen, as Commodus' sister and would-be lover of Maximus, has\nto run the gauntlet of Commodus' psychotic behaviour to preserve her's\nand her son's lives. All in all, top notch acting all-round. They're\ngiven a great story and script to work with, too.<br><br>The cinematography is magnificent. The colours the dust, great camera\nangles, judicious cutting around scenes. It works to create intense\nimages that place the actors firmly in the forefront. The digital\nrecreation of roses is amazing and you have to look very hard to detect\nthe digital effects. Ridley Scott has produced one of his greatest\ndirecting achievements.<br><br>Finally, the music, from Hans Zimmer, is magnificent. It supports the\naction and moods of the scenes expertly, without ever intruding too\nmuch, which is the mark, IMO, of a great score and soundtrack.<br><br>If you have not seen this movie, or bought the Blu-Ray, I have only one\nquestion: why not? This is a MUST WATCH movie. Simple as that.\n"},
{"review": "\nLoved this movie but the best sequence was at the beginning when the\ndisciplined, methodical, Roman Army slaughtered a disorganized German\nhorde in a filmed battle sequence with no equal other than perhaps the\nstorming of Normandy beach from Spielberg's movie Saving Private Ryan!\nTactics will beat brute force every time! The emperor overseeing this\nslaughter was Marcus Aurelius who was the last of the adoptive\nemperors, also referred to as the 'Good Emperors'. It started with\nNerva, who adopted Trajan, who in turn adopted Hadrian, who was\nfollowed by Antoninus Pius who in turn was succeeded by Marcus\nAurelius. During their rule there was a considerable expansion of the\nRoman empire, from northern Britain to Dacia and to Arabia and\nMesopotamia, followed by a consolidation and an attempt to perfect the\nempire's defenses (e.g. Hadrian's Wall in Britain). This all started to\nunravel under Commodus (son of Marcus Aurelius). The period of the\nadoptive emperors started with the assassination of a horrible emperor\n(Domitian) and ended with another horrible emperor (Commodus who also\nwas assassinated). This is all historical fact and that's the end of\nthe movie's factual content everything else is just fiction! But\nenjoyable fiction with the formulaic mistake of turning the main\nprotagonist into something of a superhero and that's why it isn't\ngetting a 10!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is one of my absolute favorites. I loved Maximus, Commodus,\nand Lucilla. The plot was perfect, the violence appropriate for those\ntimes. I think that the character, \"Commodus\" was one we absolutely\nloved to hate. But, he was weak, and really only wanted to love, and be\nloved. I loved the fighting scenes, so realistic. Cicero was another\none of my favorite characters. Always faithful to Maximus to the very\nend. He set things in motion for Maximus, when he contacted Lucilla.\nShe paid him and thanked him. I think she loved Maximus, but it was not\nclear that they could actually be together, if he lived. Which brings\nme to the only part of the movie i would've changed.

{"review": "\nHard to believe Gladiator is 15 years old now, such a fantastic movie\nthat will never go out of style.

Admittedly the story\nwas also a bit draggy in parts, its almost 3 hours long and at times I\nwas confused as to where it was taking place Morocco? but the location\nissue is just me.<br><br>Russell Crowe is Oscar worthy as he embodies Maximus.

He soon arouses the rage of the emperors jealous and\nbloodthirsty son when it becomes known that Maximus is to be the\nsuccessor. A bit of murder happens then with Maximus finding himself a\nwidower, beaten, enslaved and forced to become a gladiator. The final\nbattle goes down at the Coliseum in Rome with an ending that I thought\nwas perfect \"Am I not merciful?\" <br><br>Really beautiful music here too, and a top notch extended cast\nincluding a SOA sighting from one Tommy Flanagan.

{"review": "\nSummer blockbusters are creatures of their own, aiming to cater to and\nexploit our lowest desires. Ridley perfectly understands this and\nconsciously tries to redefine them when he gets a chance. Unlike many\nothers, he knows what he is doing and approaches the matter with care\ninstead of force. This works only because of him.<br><br>We have a movie about a spectacle, in which we and the mob are one and\nthe same. It's cynical as it bashes the industry and us, yet hopeful\nwith its vision for the future. The visual style is novel and somewhat\ncounterintuitive. Typically, one would expect huge cinematic battles,\nfilled with bloodshed, as well as a very architecturally dimensional\nRome, filled with pride of its history. Here, these are handed very\ndifferently, casually placed in the background. We imagine and deduce\nthem from the eyes of the characters - very subtle, especially for a\nsummer blockbuster. Instead, the focus here is on emotion and tension.\nTension between a \"cheap entertainment thrill\" and \"strength and\nhonor\". Judging by how successful this was, new endeavors should learn\nfrom it, as it shows that the audience expects something more. <br><br>Crowe is utilized well here. Some of his scenes with Joaquin carry and\nproject that tension for us to feed on.<br><br>4/5 - Worth a watch. We've started to demand much more after this.\n"},

Two other movies came to mind when I was\nwatching this film; \"The Patriot\" and \"Braveheart\" were very similar to\n\"Gladiator\" because they all contain unique action sequences, will\nbecome classics and all star actors in Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe,\nwho have become major players in Hollywood. <br><br>\"Gladiator\" may not be the best movie, but it will win over the hearts\nof viewers when they rent it at their local video stores. I can't wait\nto let everyone know \"Gladiator\" has become one of my favorite films. I\nhope everyone will enjoy it as I did. \"Gladiator\" is rich in history\nand is a masterpiece with all the trimmings.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nGladiator is an underrated movie to say the least. It should be on the\ntop 10, and in my book it's at position 1. <br><br>People tend to think it's bad because it's not 100% historically\naccurate. Guess what, it's not a documentary, it shouldn't be judged as\none.<br><br>The dialogue is strong and the story is the one we all love, and it\nplays out without flaw in Gladiator. The movie sets a new standard for\nthe definition of epic. If you watch Spartacus or Ben-Hur after\nGladiator, you notice how plain and un-epic those movies are in\ncomparison. <br><br>All the actors performed flawlessly, especially Joaquin Phoenix (should\nhave won an Oscar) and Connie Nielsen, I love the \"Am I not merciful\"\nscene, so much emotion with so few words. No single actor could be\nreplaced to make this a better movie, it was a perfect cast.<br><br>The musical score is magnificent, it's so in sync with the action and\nthe emotions on the screen, and so majestically epic, it's in itself\ndestined to become a classic. Too bad Hans Zimmer was robbed of the\nOscar.<br><br>The scenery is phenomenal, the landscapes are perfect, the CGI is top\nnotch. You can FEEL the grandness of Rome. Splendid use of light and\ncolor in every single scene. I especially like the scene where Commodus\nand Maximus are elevated on to the arena, protected by a tortus\nformation of praetorian guards.<br><br>Are you not entertained? ARE you not entertained? YES, yes we ARE.\nMaximus, Maximus, Maximus, Maximus...<br><br>10/10 - A classic.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nEven though Russell Crow has gained an awful reputation as a spoiled actor,\nhis delivery in Gladiator erases it all in my mind.  His consistent and\nadmirable work pull you completely into the screen and take you on a really\nfun, sad, and rewarding adventure.<br><br>The art direction in this film is superior. The camera, the script, and the\ndirection are all examples of first class work.  Yet, sadly I see that some\npeople chose to rate it as an awful film...why? Nothing about this film is\ndone badly.  Could it be jealousy? Hatred?  Why can't we just be happy about\ngreat work and celebrate with those who were responsible for making it? \nRussell, keep up the great work.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nRidley Scott is a total legend in film making because of 3 major films\nwhich all started a revolution ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER, GLADIATOR all of\nwhich are brilliant. Gladiator is a superbly directed movie with\nstunning photography and 'OFF THE PLANET ACTING' from RUSSELL CROWE and\nan equally as good JOAQUIN PHOENIX. Both actors worked so hard to make\nthis film happen. This film should have taken best DIRECTOR and BEST\nSUPPORTING ACTOR but of course those Academy Awards ar'nt always right.\nAt least RUSSELL got the Oscar (A WELL DESERVED ONE). The score\ncomposed by HANS ZIMMER is BRILLIANT and massively powerful. Thats\nanother one that 'well' deserved the Oscar........ Gladiator depicts\nthe roman empire as it were all those years ago, 'spot on', no other\nmovie has ever displayed such power before.. HIRE this movie its worth\nIT!!!!!!<br><br>Paul .................\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI believe Gladiator to be Ridley Scott's best movie. It is filled with\nExcellent Sets, Beautiful Costumes and good Cinematography. The movie also\nhas a Great Original Score (which should have won) and fantastic Visual\nEffects. Visually, this movie is beautiful.<br><br>Ridley Scott's direction is excellent too. Russell Crowe gives a really good\nperformance, he was deserving of his award. Joaquin Phoenix gives a\nchilling, dark and excellent performance. The rest of the cast delivers good\nperformances too. Overall, 10 out of 10.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nGreat action troughout the film and never tiresome...\nCrowe plays a brillent part,he has some film history's top lines..if i had\nto say one bad thing about this film, it would be that its touch on the\nlong\nside...im glad tho its one of them films that will not have a\nsequal..yipppie!<br><br>Anyway take my advise if you've not seen this monumental\nfilm..\nWATCH IT ASAP!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI wanted to see this movie so bad when i saw the previews but i didn't see\nit until it came out on video.  This is one of my all time favorite movies. \nI didn't even know who Russell Crowe was before I saw this.  Now he is one\nof my favorite actors.  His performance is beyond great, there are no words\nto describe it.  The entire movie is just so good, there are no cheesy or\nstupid scenes.  it's a movie anyone can love and EVERYONE should see.  And\nthe battle scenes are really good.  They are gory, but if you saw The\nPatriot with Mel Gibson and was okay, you'll be fine in this movie.  I don't\nwant to say much about the plot of the story because it is just so good and\neveryone has to see it for themselves.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI was very hesitant to watch this movie based on the commercials. I\nthought\nit would be a boring movie about a guy fighting lions. But, the movie is\ngreat!!! It combines an action movie with a love story (love of country).\nIt\ndefinitely ranks in my top 10 of all time. Honestly, this is one of the\nfew\nmovies EVER that made me cry. Great plot, excellent acting and wonderful\nscript. \n"},
{"review": "\n\n   \"Gladiator\" is a film of epic proportion.  Russel Crowe gives his academy\naward performance, the first of a probable long list of awards for this\ntalented superstar.  The DVD is particularly entertaining in that it also\nshows the making of the film and much of what was left on the cutting room\nfloor.\n"},
{"review": "\n\n****<br><br>Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielson.<br><br>A Roman general becomes a slave when he is betrayed.  His wife and son were\nbrutally murdered by the prince.  But when the slave becomes a gladiator, he\nfights his way to get to the prince.<br><br>The battle sequences, in my opinion, were breathtaking.  Especially the\nfight between all the slaves and the other fighters.  This movie is quite\nbloody (That black arrow lady bit the big one), so you better not eat much\nbefore you see this. <br><br>This film is one of the greatest of all time, and it deserved every award it\nwon.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI don't like the trend modern movies are taking.  Simply put, they kill\neveryone the main character knows, and that forces him into action that will\nforce him to action that involves killing all the bad guys.  Normal \nantagonists aren't enough anymore, the bad guys must be literal psychos. \nIt's depressing. <br><br>This movie handles things a bit differently.  The main character actually\nremembers his wife and kid throughout the entire movie.  Sorry, no more\nspoilers.  In any case, I like the camera movement during the large action\nscenes as it helps to simulate the chaotic action experienced during action\nscenes.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI like to try to \"switch\" roles in movies; then when the actors/actresses\njust don't measure up the same way the final cast does, then we can see\njust\nhow hard casting directors must work to fulfill this delicate cog of the\nsilver-screen wheel.<br><br>Russell Crowe as Maximus was a role just for that actor. Also the Emperor\nCommodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, that part was well cast. But the two\nfine actors just cannot be reversed with the roles, can they? Of course\nnot.<br><br>The medium of movies requires tons of man-hours, equipment, then\npost-production, etc., all of this just to tell a story, entertain people\nfor a very short time. Gladiator was that movie that utilized all\navailable\nfacilities and human potential to closely portray this tale of the Roman\nEmpire circa 180 A.D. This movie really did not stray too far from reality\nas a lot of movies do, just for the entertainment value. We do know that\nthe\nColiseum existed, have historical accounts that closely resemble the\nliving\nconditions and daily life of the people of 180 A.D.<br><br>Gladiator has a moral center in which the main characters never waved from\neven when it could be expected to do so under such conditions.<br><br>Maximus drove everything he had to accomplish what he did, against the\ninsurmountable odds, and that makes a great story.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nGladiater is without a doubt the best movie of the new millennium. There are\nalmost no flaws with the filming or acting (aside from the fact the Russell\nCrowe is in real life a loser). Crowe deserved his accademy award for\nacting.                   PLOT. A general in ancient Rome is forced to flee\nthe land after not bowing before the new Emperor ( who killed his own father\nto be Emporer). And so Maximus ( the general) becomes a slave and must\nbattle through Gladiator combat, hoping to avenge the death of the original\nemperor.           The film is packed with pulsating and gruesome violence\nand yet incredible acting abillity. 9.5 out of 10.   PSSSST! if you watch\none of the chariot battles carefully, you can see a gas canister which the\nfilm makers needed to flip over one of the chariots!\n \n"}
