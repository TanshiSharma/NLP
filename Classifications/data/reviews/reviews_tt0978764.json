{"review": "\nI recently saw Sucker Punch at an advance screening and thoroughly\nenjoyed it. To be honest, I am the target demographic here. I'm a guy\nin his twenties who plays video games and enjoys fantasy movies and\naction.... but this is a decent film overall. It appeals to my\n\"sensible adult\" side that appreciates a good, well written film, with\ngreat directing, great acting, and overall good cinematography. It also\nappeals to my \"twenty-something male\" side that loves sexy ladies,\nguns, killer robots, dragons, samurai and swordplay. The abundant CG is\nstunningly beautiful and doesn't feel overdone or become visually\nexhausting like some movies. This movie gets me. and I know that there\nwill be a good number of people who dislike this movie, dismissing it\nas juvenile, or stupid. who dislike the amount of CGI used in this\nmovie. I don't care... I love this movie for exactly what it is... a\ngood movie that appeals to me in every way.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have been absolutely pumped for this movie since I first saw the\ntrailer for it last summer. I'm fresh from viewing it, and I have to\nsay that it's not quite what I expected, though not necessarily in a\nbad way. To those who haven't seen it, two words: Do it. But be open to\nthe fact that it will almost certainly not be exactly what you expect.\nAlthough it looks like a somewhat mindless kick ass, eye candy flick,\ndon't be fooled: there is a pretty good story here, and its deeper than\nyour first impression of it will be, also. Oh, and don't try and\npredict the ending.<br><br>After you watch it, you will need to process what actually happened,\nbut put your thinking cap on- because its deeper than you think.<br><br>All in all, the acting was good enough (though it didn't blow my mind),\nthe visuals are stellar (did blow my mind) and the soundtrack is\namazing (where is my mind?). Definitely worth seeing. 8/10\n"},
{"review": "\nSucker Punch is totally out there, and probably the only way to combine\nso many different things in a single story.<br><br>The story telling is incomplete, in itself, but not the story. Most of\nit is told metaphorically. You get to imagine the rest. An easy thing\nto do is to dismiss the movie because of the beautiful women, or the\nintense and fantastical action. That is a grand mistake. The story is\npoignant and very sad, yet wrapped in a beautiful cinematographic\ncocoon. It's breathtaking. I kept wondering when the hammer blow of bad\npoorly constructed elements would descend upon me and disappointment,\nbreak my heart. It never did.<br><br>The dialogs might look simple, and the story line really quick, but\ntheir complementing information is in the magic of the metaphors. It's\nan incredible ride led by the excellent acting of those gorgeous\ncreatures and genius directorial mind, as well as the superb editing\nand CGI.<br><br>Ride the wave, shed a tear, see it.\n"},
{"review": "\nEven with millions of bullets flying through the air, dozens of swords\nswinging &amp; the hundreds of punches these hotties take, not one of these\ngirls ever gets a single scratch during the battles. After the first\nbrawl pitting the Girls Club against steam-powered Germans &amp; ferocious\nshooting planes it's so painfully obvious that none of the girls will\nbe in any real danger that the big budget special effects are just\nfluff &amp; overkill. What's the point of all the bullets &amp; bad guys if the\nchicks are indestructible? By the second battle it's just so irritating\nwatching these females punch, kick, shoot, jump &amp; slice their way\nthrough crowds of bad guys when they could have just walked &amp; not\ngotten hurt. The story is clever but watching chicks that fight again &amp;\nagain &amp; can't possibly be defeated is not one-tenth as interesting as\nwatching people who can actually die in battle.\n"},
{"review": "\nI,m not sure who and why rated this masterpiece so bad, I guess it's\njust that you either love it or hate it...but the movie has everything\nand is for everyone. You just have to let yourself go in it and enjoy.\nWell, half naked and attractive girls kicking ass, dance, strip;\nfantastic music, flawlessly directed fight scenes, drama, sadness, true\nnature of man who is just evil and one good girl is giving all to beat\nit. With every viewing you get something new, cause it's hard to\nunderstand it fully. But that's the beauty of it, the story behind of\nanother story, dream within a dream and it's all wrapped up in a box\nwhich is made to entertain and teach you something. That's what movies\nare for, and that's why I love it!!\n"},
{"review": "\nI heard nothing but bad things about this movie, and I finally saw it.\nI fell in love with it. Everything about it was so great and visual (as\nexcepted with Zack Snyder). What people lose grasp of, I think, is that\n90% of the film is in Babydoll's head. Therefore, anything goes. Yeah\nthey're dressed scandalously, but what else would they be wearing in a\nyoung girl's mind? And of course they're going to be able to fight,\nit's all in her mind. It was a way of escaping for Babydoll. If my\nmother and sister were just killed, I might be a little screwed in the\nhead too, wouldn't you? I think people saw the preview, and just\nassumed hot chicks and special effects. They didn't (and usually never\ndo) think beyond what is shown to them on screen. I love Synder's work,\nand it's sad that this is by far his least appreciated film.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is by far, Zack Snyder's worst movie until present time. However,\nit is still a ravishing visual spectacle, guided by a magnificent\nfeminine bombshell cast and accompanied by an electrically dynamic\nsoundtrack.<br><br>The problem is that these elements are unable to delete the sensation\nof a story sometimes told in a 'videoclip' manner and the ''300''\ndirector on a autopilot mode, only concerned with the film's aesthetic\noutlook.<br><br>Despite that narrative ellipsis, this is a perfect Sunday afternoon\npopcorn flick, presenting itself as a delirium 'video game' crossing\nbetween ''The Matrix'' and ''Charlie's Angels''. Only without the\nintellectual quality than the first one, but with more and better\naction than the second.\n"},
{"review": "\nWatch the extended version, do not watch the theatrical version, I\nrepeat the extended version is 1000% better and it makes sense and it\nhas two well known actors in it that were cut from the theatrical\nversion! But be warned it's darker, but only because we get\nanswers....... The rest of this review must be non-filler. Why is it\nrequired that I type this much, who knows? This movie, with a proper\nending, can be compared with Fight club, if that doesn't convince you\nmaybe my personal testimony will, I almost never write reviews on here,\nI've only written one other review other than this one. Watch the\nextended cut! If anything watch it to see more of the high roller,\nplayed by John Hamm and to understand the ending.\n"},
{"review": "\nAn impressive and inspiring fantasy movie with impressive visuals and\nimpressive cast, a fascinating movie that tried to speak to you outside\nof reality, a movie that inspires you to dream, to live in a reality\nwhere you can control everything, a movie that deserves to be called a\nmasterpiece, a movie that teaches you that it doesn't matter where you\nare the mind will always be our home sweet home.<br><br>Strong and solid performances in the movie, worth to mention Emily\nBrowning as the lead character that connects with the audience and\nAbbie Cornish as the fascinating strong headed deuteragonist, Carla\nGugino outshined half of the cast with her solid performance as Dr.\nVera Gorski, but Scott Glenn and Abbie Cornish are the ones that truly\nshine in this fascinating movie with strong and solid Golden Globe\nworthy performances.\n"},
{"review": "\nI give this movie a 7 out of 10. The Movie is about a young girl who is\nsent into an asylum by her evil step dad and then creates and alternate\nreality in her head in order to find a way to escape. Emily Browning\ndid an amazing job at portraying Baby Doll, her real name (in the film)\nwas not used because they were given stripper names. This was not just\na normal asylum. During the film the director, Zack Snyder, used many\ndifferent elements including music and camera angles to give a sense of\nsuspense or shock during the scenes. What i think makes this such a\ngreat film is because it is very serious about a girl being trapped and\nmisused, however in her alternate realities, Baby Doll gets to fight in\nmany engaging action scenes throughout the movie instead of watching\nher dance on stage. Which also helps make the movie more about the\ncharacter and not about half naked girls dancing on stage for fat old\nmen smoking cigars.\n"},
{"review": "\nthis film is one of the greatest films ever made, this is way better\nthan Inception, in the film, <br><br>they keep telling you that \"Its you who holds the power over the worlds\nyou create\" and its true you get to choose/believe in whatever you\nthink happened in the film, whether Babydoll accidentally shot her\nsister or framed by her father, whether babydoll is real or the girls\nor they could just be a pigment of SweetPea's imagination, there are a\nlot more theories that you get to choose how to end. but them (the\ngirls: baby doll,sweetpea,rocket,blondie and amber are definitely using\ntheir bodies sexually, to get what they need but instead of thinking\nthey are being raped/abused they turn them into action packed fantasies<br><br>this film has little dialogues and an and the story line really quick,\nbut thats the best part of it , SO PAY ATTENTION while watching.

{"review": "\nI totally love it. The story, the acting, the CG &amp; the music. Movies\nare made to entertained and i was. And it had a metaphor which was\ngreat. The first time i saw it i didn't quite understood it, mostly\nbecause as many other people I'm not used to \"think\" to understand a\nmovie. But after watching it a couple of times, it becomes more a more\nclear to me. Besides I love the music so much it wasn't a drag. I will\nsee this movie again and again :) I don't know what else to say.

{"review": "\nI think Zack Synder must suffer from ADHD judging by this film, and\nthats not a bad thing. I've been a fan of his since Dawn of the dead,\nnot a fan boy but I like his style over substance filmmaking, he's\ncertainly better and more consistent then a lot of other big budget\ndirectors out there.<br><br>Right from the start we are in the familiar Snyder-isms of CGI and slow\nmotion. Complaints about the lack of story are valid but then that's\nnot the point of this film. Its purely a visual experience and as such\nit delivers in spades.<br><br>Coupled with the sheer beauty of Emily Browning's eyes and game\nperformances from all involved, this is great, not perfect, summer\nentertainment. I think that Synder continues to grow and develop as a\nfilmmaker, and I look forward to his Superman film.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is one of he best movies, I've ever seen. It's real, and unreal at\nthe same time, it's gripping and emotionally engaging. It's also full,\nof eye candy, but that only adds to the feel of some parts being\nunreal, and because of that they are also beautiful, while the reality\nis cruel and unforgiving. The cast was chosen excellently, the music\nand sounds were beyond perfect. Well, I guess, I am not a really good\ncritic, but if a movie makes me register to a site, just to worship it;\nthan that movie has accomplished something thousands of others\ncouldn't. I strongly advise anyone to go on and watch this movie, it's\na masterpiece.

{"review": "\nperfection. its not all about a fantasy movie or comics its all about\nbrain. and deserve really hard applauds. thats the point; there s one\ngirl who fight against her fears and what she got from life and finally\nshe wanted to escape. and she doing this so well in her brain. with\nguns, with fire and all the immortality. those re means endless power\nof her about what she wants to do. escape. <br><br>the end of this experiment (i mean the movie) we think that everything\nabout ourselves. everything in our hands. all the good and bad things.\njust about our minds. but later we seeing some other point, we cant\nknow and see who will gonna make light to our way in the future. its\nlike a miracle. <br><br>totally loved this movie. its just all about catch the meaning. but\npeople will see that what they want to see.. or what they can see\nanyway. have a nice day.\n"},

Then it follows\nthe sudden change of the movie setting. It started from the asylum then\ninto a burlesque brothel. Then every time Baby Doll (Emily Browning)\ndances, she channels another world. A world where she and her friends;\nSweet Pea (Abby Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa\nHudgens), &amp; Amber (Jamie Chung) kicks asses of Samurai-robot warriors,\nclock works, dragons, gores and robots from WWI to dragon lairs.

{"review": "\nWell, the movie is completely underrated here. That's why I'm leaving\nthis brief review. It's Zack Snyder's film, not for everyone. The movie\nis dark, music is good, plot is excellent, three CGIs set-ups are from\ngames - fantasy, WWI and scifi. It's a kind of mix of everything. But\nthe major plot is brilliant, and the ending is great. You don't need to\nconcentrate on CGI scenes or their quality. Zack Snyder could equally\ninsert anime or just pictures instead with the same effect, it doesn't\nreally matter. The movies is not about manga girls acting in games.\nWhen you watch all this darkness of the clinics recreated by Zack\nSnyder, and the final medical verdict made, and you know a bit history\nof American psychiatry, you start thinking more about dark American\npast and where all these evil people came from. Surely, not from dreams\nof the poor girl.\n"},
{"review": "\nI hate this phrase, but this movie truly shows \"girl power\". It's\nextremely sad, but it shows what a person can rise above and how if\nsomeone really wants something, to rise above, they can. Like a quote\nfrom the movie, \"You have all the weapons, now fight!\". It also proves\nthat there are people who will sacrifice themselves for someone they\ncare about or a cause that they care about. I love how they showed the\n\"theater\" when Baby Doll first gets there, and then she ends up acting\nout scenarios in her head that describe how she's feeling, how it feels\nto fight for something. The best part I think, is the fact that they\nsay, everyone has a guardian angel, they come in different forms, an\nold man one day and a young girl the next. Most of all, that they\naren't here to fight your battles, you're here to fight your battles,\nthey are just here to show you the way and to keep you going. Overall,\nI think this is a must-see!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is actually pretty complex and intelligent in spite of its\nbad reputation as a meaningless action flick.

{"review": "\nMost of the movie took place inside the fantasy world minds of young\nwomen committed to a mental hospital.

The young women fought their demons in a video game-like\nfantasy world as a kind of out of body experience.

There is\nmuch subtlety crafted into this plot and the main character's\nsubjugations and aspirations. <br><br>If I have one gripe, the use of sepia and dark grayscale tones\nthroughout the movie is overused. This was obviously the film maker's\nintent to bring out color when it does appear, as in the dragonfire,\nalas I feel true color could have been used to more advantage, so long\nas it didn't rise to the over color saturation movies like Avatar fell\nprey to.<br><br>Absolutely recommended if you like intense kung fu surreality flicks!\n"},

Her dance takes her into this weird but amazingly shown\nplaces where she basically fights off real problems shown as monsters &amp;\nmagic.

The film did\nalmost everything that it wants to achieve; but it's just that these\nachievements are somehow covered by the story, which shouldn't be an\nimportant part of the film in the first place. I hope Zack could have\nused a much simpler story so that the audiences can focus more on the\nvisual part of the film, realise its achievements and give a better\nresponse. I cannot say that I totally like or enjoyed the film but I\nstill appreciate Zack's work on it. Afterall, still a good job Zack;\nkeep working on. Hope to see more movies made by you.<br><br>Oh, one more thing. The part that Baby Doll fights against the three\ngiant warriors, it is, WOW, so cool that I almost don't know how to\ndescribe it.\n"},
{"review": "\nSeeing the trailer, I immediately (and wrongfully) assumed this movie\nwas going to be targeted at young male guys, who are probably single,\nand want to witness hot girls in heavy action sequences. How far off\ncould my first impression be?<br><br>It was a fantastic movie in my opinion and I cannot understand the hate\nfor this movie. Its so much more deeper than I imagined and the cgi is\nvisually stunning. The storyline is brilliant and 'Blue's' acting is\ndefinitely one of the reasons this movie held together so well. Sucker\nPunch shows there is more than meets the eye.<br><br>Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. OH YEAH!\n"},
{"review": "\nI normally do not write reviews for movies, however, when a movie has\nleft an impression on me I feel compelled to do so. I actually had high\nexpectations for Sucker Punch and this movie exceeded those\nexpectations. It's not just a bunch of hot girls in skimpy outfits\nkicking trash and an overabundant amount of CGI. The story is\nfantastic, easy to follow, and downright original. I can guarantee that\nthe people who do not like this movie are stuck up, and have no\nimagination, and are probably the kind of people I wouldn't want to\nhang out with. If you aren't one of these people, then I promise you\nwill love it from start to finish. I can only wish more movies brought\nsuch entertainment and originality.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm really surprised at a lot of people's thoughts on this film. I've\nheard it called misogynistic and s hallow, but I thought it was exactly\nthe opposite. I thought it was empowering. <br><br>It depicts the journey of a young girl through guilt, pain and loss\nthrough the medium of an alternate reality. This metaphor in which the\ncharacters live is a cabaret style brothel. The girls fight for freedom\nand dignity in a situation that so harshly strips them of it. <br><br>I especially loved the action scenes within this. They were,\nadmittedly, a touch far fetched, but the amazing level of kick ass\ncontained in these scene out weighed any sense of unbelieving. <br><br>I really loved this movie. I loved that it was so very open ended. I\nloved that it was so original. I loved the way the action scenes broke\nup the emotionally heavy storyline. I loved the whole thing. I just\nloved it.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst I would like to thank my dear friends for making me watch this\nAWESOME movie!!! This was so wicked cool man.

She has been locked away\nagainst her will, but Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will\nto survive.\n"},

Seeing the main character so helpless was not what I was\nexpecting.<br><br>As the movie evolved, I realized this was imperially exciting. A series\nof events, under the eyes of a very strong willed, ingenious minded\nBaby Doll, the movie makes you travel to a world where almost\neverything is possible sending this strong message to its audience: We\njust have to put our minds to it to accomplish what we want. <br><br>Very sad drama story which includes a very adult issue, displayed with\na lot of taste and brilliance.<br><br>Awesome scenery, beautiful fights, and characters. I loved the movie\nmore and more and the story developed.

{"review": "\nZach Snyder paints another masterpiece. Visually spectacular and\npoetic, Director extraordinary, Great Style and Set (the same of\nAvatar), Soundtrack Powerful, Good Cast (Emily Browing is very Good)\nand incredibly original plot.

And who often goes\nto the movies know what it's like this. IMHO the only flaw is that the\nmovie is a little too short, so i Hope in a Directo's Cut in Blu-Ray.\nIf you liked 300 or watchmen this is an absolutely MUST SEE!\n"},
{"review": "\nWell \"You will be unprepared\" is aptly quoted. The movie is original in\nits concept and creativity. Beautifully done graphics and action packed\nsequences. However, with still a feeble story line.<br><br>So despite all the brilliant work put in it by its creator and the\nfairly decent work put in by the actors, the movie falls flat on its\nface. The continuity is questionable, the switch between the first two\nrealities is very abrupt and not explained at all.<br><br>The second,third and the fourth action sequences are fairly similar and\nlack the excitement of the first. Their concept could have been so much\nmore creative.<br><br>Costumes and make up were well done. The characters were well thought\nout.

Whatever\nthe reasons, Sucker Punch fails to be as brilliant as it potentially\ncould have been.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this at Warner Bros. where I work. Really like Zach's visual\nstyle, but man, is he weak on story. So many things are not well played\nout. The girls are at an asylum, but no one acts crazy. The fantasy\nworld of the movie feels like set pieces for an upcoming video game.\nThere are times when the girls seem to be capable of anything, and\nother times hopelessly ineffective. One last thing, if you're going to\nuse rock music in a score, use the originals, or at least have killer\nversions by new artists. Glad I saw it, but I'm really getting tired of\ncartoon movies and cartoon characters. Zach Snyder has so much promise\nin this industry, and I'm really pulling for him, but I think his only\nhome run so far has been \"300\".\n"},
{"review": "\nA lot can be said about this film, but only when accompanied by\nclenched fists and a look of bewilderment. Wooden acting,\none-dimensional characters, awful writing, boring and repetitive action\nsequences, a plot which is predictable in it's journey to no-where, a\nlack of meta-story, a horrible degradation of well-loved songs,\nevidently bad editing (which is a rare one)... All contributing to a\npile of misogynist filth that makes you wonder why you still bother\ngoing to the cinema. This film characterizes everything that is wrong\nwith modern cinema, emphasizing looks above content and a type of\n'stylised' filmmaking which is long past its sell by date above common\nsense. Don't see this film, unless you enjoy developing an aversion of\nmovies.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have been a fan to Mr. Zack since the movie 300. A total of 5 years\nin making will be paid off when you watch this one. I love the gradient\ncolors, stunning CGI and video game based hack and slash stunts. Plot\nis simple, but the execution is tough. Zack had done a beautiful job in\npresenting this movie with his own glamor style. Emily does justice to\nthe character with her cheesy looks and decent acting. The rest of the\ncrew is apt to their roles. Music is very nice which will mix up to the\nscenes. Overall an average story with great screenplay with gorgeous\nvisuals which makes you to stick to your seat. A brave 8/10 for this\nbaby doll.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie gives me ambivalent feelings. It has excellent technical\naspects, as one would expect from Zack Snyder, but i rather more\nenjoyed the LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS than this one, which although was\nan animated one about owls, had more story and worthy visual effects\nthan this one. Mistake me not - the FX in this movie are super cool,and\nthe eye-candy kicking their way through the plot are well worth it. But\nit is the plot that i cannot grasp. The director has definitely\nsucceeded in blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, and you do\nget to understand the way things go even though it appears to be\nfantasy, which is the basis of this film ( as per tag line and\nstoryline, a girl dreams of other things to plot of escape in a very\nglum asylum) However, after sitting for nearly 2 hours with this one, i\ncan't keep wondering...what's the point of this film??\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was, in my opinion, too confusing. At first, everything\nseems to make sense, the stepfather is trying to kill the children to\nget the money. But within 2 minutes, things start to get weird. First\noff, Baby Doll hits the light bulb with the gun, which is hanging from\nthe ceiling, but yet her sister is still hit, appearing to be about 4\nfoot tall. What's even worse, it hits her waist! As well, the movie\nspends too much time in the fantasy acid trip harem whatever you call\nit, and not enough time in the 'real world'. It became too hard to\ndetermine what was actually happening. And then the ending was a\ncop-out. They just said, \"Oh yeah, this girl is not the main character,\nthe other one is.\" My only compliment is that the fight scenes are\nawesome!\n"},
{"review": "\nThere are a handful of scenes that are magnificently illustrated and a\nreal treat to watch. But the character portrayal and overall story is\nappallingly bad. <br><br>What you do if you watch this is you skip through the hospital scenes\nand go to the scenes which take place inside her imagination. The\nreason the movie was made was to spotlight the nice effects. There is\nbasically no story at all being told here.<br><br>Is Emily Browning a good actress?

{"review": "\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest meets Charlies Angels meets Final\nFantasy (meets 300) meets Fight Club. <br><br>Not sure if this film is an unapproachable mess or a deep genius-\ninspired masterwork full of symbolism and philosophy.

Surely you don't think most viewers can pick up\non all that? Whats real? Who's real? Whats the message and whats the\nmessage behind the message? Its a little dizzying and Im pretty sure\nthey don't pull it off. You really need to actually take notes\n(especially when the narrator(s) talk) to really have a chance at\nputting it all together.

{"review": "\nI liked this movie quite a lot but it makes me irritated that you want\nto love it but can't. The story underneath the psychedelic drug trip is\nvery interesting and it 's a bit of a Life of PI situation. The movie\nis basically ruined by the best thing in it. Which 's strange. The\naction is amazing but that is what takes you out of the story that is\nactually going on. When babydoll dances in the film she shows us what\nthey are doing but in a different way and as a result we end up with\nthese metaphor clogged video game missions that take you out of what Is\nactually a very good story about freedom.

{"review": "\nI do like movies in which reality gets mixed up and so I also came to\nsee this one. And as many others I'm totally confused after watching\nit; It is an amazing spectacle but is it total garbage or is it a great\nmovie, I really do not know. The absolute weird things of the movie,\nlike the casting of apparently botoxed Emily Browning as baby doll,\nseems to be a big mistake, but on the other side it fits very well\nbecause the movie is in many cases so totally overdone, like the\nimagery which sometimes reminds of a music video clip and often focuses\non details, the bizarre soundtrack, the acting. So then I came to the\nconclusionit must have been on purpose and the movie is more a parody\non the sexy girls with weapons movies then it tries to fit in. So\ndepending on what you expected in this movie you will be either\ndisappointed or flabbergasted. If like movies that confuse you, it is a\nrecommendation.

{"review": "\nSucker Punch is totally different movie than any others in this type.\nOf course it is made of sole of pop culture - violence, love, blood and\npretty-stupid girls even called \"doll\".
