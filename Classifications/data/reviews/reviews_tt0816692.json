All I know is\nthat my hard-earned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with\nme and for that I am truly regretful.

Nolan himself says in\ninterviews that this is what he wanted -- really loud with dialog\nthat's hard to hear. To make it \"more immersive\" apparently. But if I\nwant immersive, I can go ride my pick of rides at an amusement park.\nWhat I want when I go to the theater is for the director to tell a\nstory. And his crappy sound design gets in the way of his telling of\nhis story. And the story is yet another variation on his favorite theme\nof recursion. Meh. Getting old Chris. Old.

{"review": "\nInterstellar is a movie that never gets off the ground. Based on a\nscript that wanders from end to end attempts to comprehend its plot and\nthemes are very difficult for the viewer. Heavily weighted with Academy\nAward winners including Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael\nCaine and Ellen Burstyn they are never able to surmount this poorly\nwritten script. From the beginning it was obvious many elements of\nInterstellar were lifted from other films. These included 2001 a Space\nOdyssey and Enemy Mine. Promising not to giveaway details Muppets in\nSpace was more enjoyable. Interstellar starts in a backwater town and\nends on a planet 2nd rate planet. With a running time of 2 hours and 49\nminutes schedule yourself at least one break. Why? Because you will be\nstaring at your watch constantly hoping the film would tear.

{"review": "\n9.1 at IMDb? Seriously?? 4 of my 5 stars are for the visual effects. 1\nstar is for McConaugh and Hathaway. The Nolan brothers, however, get\nzilch for their bullshit cosmology mixed with banal sentimentality and\nquasi-philosophy. It is a mystery to me, why some filmmakers love to\nmix so much \"science\" into their movies, when most of it is so\nhorrendously unrealistic, misleading, incomprehensible and incorrect.\nKubrick avoided most of the science talk, and created an artistic\nexpression of the space-and-time mystery. That's why \"2001\" will remain\na masterpiece and why \"Interstellar\" will be soon forgotten. And the\nmovie is also painfully slow, 168 mins, most of which are spent on\ncloseups of McConaugh and Hathaway, with or without space helmet as\nwell as worn and rusty space equipment, as if that would make it look\nmore real...\n"},

Interstellar tries\nto get the science right but quantum physics doesn't make for the best\ndialogue. Neither are helped by dropping the spoken track way down in\nthe sound mix. McConaughey's tendency to speak through gritted teeth\ndoesn't help either. Although it looks great and is often very\nimaginative, the film takes too much time exploring dead ends and\ndetours. At times, it felt a bit like a very long trailer for a very\nepic series. And it really does seem very long, without ever settling\non a unified theme.
