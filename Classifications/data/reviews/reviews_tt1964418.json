{"review": "\nI very rarely write reviews for movies, but after watching Tomorrowland\nI've never seen a movie that's been so unfairly maligned by negative\nreviews,especially considering that this movie was an absolute joy from\nbeginning to end. After watching it, and reading truly horrible,\nreviews I'm starting to think that somebody hired a few live bodies to\nslate this movie for their own specific reasons. <br><br>The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless\npossibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in\nthe plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were\nincredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the\npace.<br><br>Please, please watch this movie and make your own mind up - the\nnegative reviews almost put me off, but I'm so glad I actually took the\nchance. <br><br>Actually there's one proviso here - and is probably something\nconsistent with most of the negative reviews: If you lack imagination,\nor the yearning for a better world, then you'll hate this movie. Or you\nwant to raise kids who aspire to be nothing more than reality TV\nactors. Or if you're a reality TV actor. Or your kids can't read or\nwrite because you don't think it's important. Or if you think science\nis dumb. Or if you can't embrace hope.<br><br>As for me...I loved it. I'll be watching it again and again :-)One of\nthe best movies of 2015, and now on my \"favourite movie\" list.\n"},
{"review": "\nI can't believe the bad reviews. I also can't believe that nobody\nunderstood what they accomplished with this film. It's Ayn Rand's Atlas\nShrugged! They managed to take that book and bring it up to date while\nmaking it accessible to all ages. That is a fantastic feat in and of\nitself. To also make it really entertaining is extraordinary. Cerebral\nand action packed, it holds the attention of the young right to the\nend. And the end? The film was the pin that showed the audience what\ncould be if only we don't give up and just make things better. Atlas\nShrugged and then asked for help. Everybody should see this film. Now.\nOh, ignore the comments about continuity. Does it really matter?\nArtistic licence anyone?

{"review": "\nI went and saw this with an open mind because of the mixed response,\nand I must say I had a blast.<br><br>The story is unique, creative and quite compelling. It is original\nscience fiction which we do not get too often. The film is inspired by\nthe Disney park, but at the same time, it's more of it's own thing.<br><br>It is well acted and the characters are quite likable and believable.\nFrank Walker is interesting, entertaining and has a sense of humor.\nCasey is also an interesting character. I think George Clooney and\nBritt Robertson portrayed their leading roles very well.<br><br>The film is also quite funny at times. During this film, I think I may\nhave laughed more than I usually do at the movies, which is saying\nsomething.<br><br>I think Brad Bird did a very goo job directing. The visuals are\nstunning and the special effects, while mostly CGI, are impressive. The\naction scenes are neat and intense. There is not a single moment where\nI was bored with the film. It also pays a nice homage to the Sci-fi\ngenre.<br><br>The one problem I had with this film is that I was expecting a little\nmore of the \"Tomorrowland\" place and that the story needed a little\nmore work.<br><br>Overall, this was a great film and I highly recommend it to fans of\nscience fiction. Plus, I think it totally puts \"The Haunted Mansion\"\n(2003) to shame.<br><br>In the end, \"Tomorowland\" may not fully realize it's potential, but it\nshould be satisfying as a fun and intriguing Disney family\nsci-fi/adventure comedy thrill ride.\n"},
{"review": "\nI think this movie was fantastic. You should know what you are watching\nand who is the target audience and have the right mindset. For example\nif you are watching any of the Aliens you are looking for a bit of\nhorror, thrill and some brutality; and if you are watching Avatar you\nare looking a hardcore mystery and thrill. I think Brad Bird did an\namazing job for its target audience. When I watched it I was not\nexpecting brutality, hardcore action or deep mystery, I was expecting\ngood quality soft Sci-Fi. I think it did great to keep me extremely\ninterested throughout the movie and the message of the film and its\ndelivery was beautiful. Talking to and reading the reviews of those who\ndidn't like it, I think they were expecting a Sci-Fi like Aliens, or\nTerminator which is like eating Coffee and Cookies for lunch! You'll\nnot enjoy it because you have the wrong expectations! It's the problem\nof the consumer not the product. So the bottom line is, if you are\nlooking for a beautiful soft inspirational Sci-Fi with an amazing\ndirection that you can watch with your kids and teenagers and\nre-energize the dreamer in you, go for it! :)\n"},
{"review": "\nI looked forward to this movie since seeing the trailers. The stunning\nvisual of Britt Roberts transported to an other worldly place, then\nGeorge Clooney asking \"do you want to go?\". Seriously? Heck yea! Maybe\nI'm a hopeless romantic, but I enjoy stories that hold out the promise\nof adventure mixed with hope and some genuine magic. I was not\ndisappointed. Tomorrowland hit all the right points with me--adventure,\nmystery, characters to love and root for, surprise story twists, laugh\nout loud moments, and, the best magic of all, hope. Saw it twice,\nsecond time with grand kids. I will be adding Tomorrowland to my Disney\ncollection.\n"},
{"review": "\nDon't listen to the haters giving this movie ones and twos, because\nthis movie is phenomenal! This was my favorite Disney movie\u0085 before\nInside Out came out (then it became my number two favorite). The\ncharacters are nice and fun with just enough screen time and character\ndevelopment to make them likable. The story: Brad Bird's GREATEST\nPREMISE since a Superhero family! The world is going to end because\nsomeone has implanted that idea into everyone's heads. So it is up to a\ngirl with a great imagination and determination to save it. But the\ntwist is the bad guy in this movie isn't George Clooney for making the\ndevice, or the Audio-Animatronic girl, or even Hugh Laurie. It's US.\nBecause we didn't know any better, we didn't try to fight the idea of\nthe end of the world. So, in a way, WE are the reason that this movie\nexists. I guess the only reason people hate on this movie is because of\nthe continuity errors and the fact that they are the bad guys. Speaking\nof, this movie does have it's faults, but who cares when you have a\ngreat story and characters AND amazing special effects. And, yeah, the\neffects in this movie are beyond amazing. When I saw Tomorrowland for\nthe first time, and the rocket in the Eiffel Tower, I was blown away! I\nsaw the trailers and the effects made me gravitate towards this movie!\nAnd the trailer is probably another reason why people don't like this\nmovie. The trailer made it look like an early preview for Star Wars 7.\nI was also expecting that, but when I saw the actual movie, the trailer\ndidn't matter. So what if you didn't get a dumb action sci-Fi flick.\nYou have a new original idea acted well, directed well, written well,\nand made at the right time that this movie should have been a hit!\nTomorrowland: Disney's dream on the big screen, and I LOVE IT.\n"},
{"review": "\nA bit uneven and too long (It takes the movie about 30 minutes to\nreally kick into gear). Otherwise I enjoyed the plot of slowly figuring\nout what is Tomorrowland and what's the purpose behind it all. So it's\nnot a perfect film but a long way from the failure it's made out to be.\nBrad Bird doesn't disappoint.<br><br>I have read quite a lot of negative comments about this movie and even\nits message and I find that to be slightly odd. From saying science\nshould only concentrate on inventions instead of research to being\nannoyingly preachy. God forbid if a movie has a message these days and\ndespite it having an agenda I thought the movie was fun and\nentertaining.<br><br>I personally found the message of the movie to be pro-science and to\nfight the cynicism and apathy that makes it seem it's impossible to\nsave the world from the direction we're going in. I usually feel\nthere's no hope for the human race but I like to see movies that try to\nconvince me otherwise and try to keep the small glimmer of hope alive.\n"},
{"review": "\nFrom Walt Disney Pictures and Brad Bird, the Oscar winning director of\nanimated classics as The Iron Giant (1999), The Incredibles (2004), and\nRatatouille (2007), comes Tomorrowland, a new sic-fi action flick with\na powerful message, great acting from George Clooney, Raffey Cassidy,\nand Britt Robertson, and breathtaking visuals. I give this film a\n9.8/10 instead of the mixed reviews from the critics (like a 50% on\nRotten Tomatoes). It is also too bad that the movie was a box office\nflop only earning $210 million worldwide against its HUGE $190 million\nbudget. It is a film about how fun the future can be if everyone has\nthe thought of \"a great big beautiful tomorrow\". I highly recommend\nthis to any Disney fans or those looking for a fun action flick, then\ngo check this one out.\n"},
{"review": "\nAfter watching Tomorrowland last night I have to say it is interesting\nand insane from Disney to create a movie like this.<br><br>Like others I have seen the trailer for the movie. It was my nieces who\nasked me to watch it with them so I thought why not.<br><br>The movie is not your normal Disney motion picture and I'm actually\nsurprised that it got a PG rating. But more or less the film shall make\nyou go WOW.<br><br>The film has a original plot that you don't see too often also the\nvisual effects are just breath taken they really brought their top\ntalents to give us effects that will leave you in amazed. <br><br>The Cast:George Clooney, Britt Robertson, Raffey Cassidy, Hugh Laurie\nmade the film work with their performances George and Britt actually\ndid a strong job in the film. <br><br>There is also some good action that make you go that's insane. It\nactually surprised that they did this in a Disney movie<br><br>However the film did stall a few times and part of the story didn't\nmake any sense leaving you feel disappointed. <br><br>Overall Tomorrowland took something different and ran with it so you\nmight be surprised once you watch it.<br><br>I give Tomorrowland an 8 out of 10\n"},
{"review": "\nThe creativity and imagination that went into this movie is stunning. A\ngreat message about how positive and forward thinking can influence our\nfutures and the futures of generations to come. The movie brought me\nback to my younger days when my imagination would make exciting dreams\nand made me think that anything was possible. <br><br>The characters were great and the scenery and colours were spectacular.\nI have never written a review before on this site, but after watching\nthis movie I was inspired and felt impelled to give my comments, if\nonly to encourage others to watch it. I remember watching Star Trek as\na child and how imaginative it was with all the communication gadgets,\nmost of which actually exist today. I wonder if many of the items seen\nin this movie will one day become reality as well, perhaps not in my\nlifetime, but with the advancement of technology and the imaginations\nof the creative people at Disney, who knows!

{"review": "\nWho would have thought that one of the most imaginative films of the\nlast five years would be a film targeted at children? Tomorrowland was\na pleasant surprise. There were a ton of really amazing scenes and a\ngrand sense of scale. The cast is magnificent. George Clooney is great\nas always. However, it must be mentioned that Raffey Cassidy almost\nsteals the show. She is definitely one to watch and as long as she\navoids the pitfalls that go with fame, she is pretty much guaranteed a\nvery bright future in the acting business.<br><br>The story is compelling and has a good message -- without sounding\npreachy. Lots of great classic science fiction homages in here, plus\nplenty of very cool modern ideas. It was great to see three generations\nof future aesthetic in the same film.<br><br>In general, the pacing is pretty good. There are a few parts where it\ndrags a bit. It makes up for it in spades in the last half of the film.\nEditing was expertly done with plenty of quick reaction cuts between\nactors to thread things together neatly. As usual, Disney's shot\nchoices are very good (very textbook actually) and the score suits the\nfilm nicely.<br><br>Be sure to treat the kid(s) in your life (your children, nieces,\nnephews) and or course, yourself to this movie. It's one of the few\nmodern family films that's actually genuinely enjoyable for all ages.\nPlus, you'll get to see some of Santiago Calatrava's more extravagant\narchitecture.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe fact that this movie gets as many bad reviews and ratings as it\ndoes absolutely astonishes me, I'm very critical when it comes to\nmovies with a \"environmental message\" like this, but I had no problem\nwith it, it was delivered in a fun laid-back tone, and Clooney's\nperformance was very sarcastic and cynical, I loved this movie for that\nreason. I don't watch Clooney often, but I'm happy he was in this.<br><br>It simply tells a great story revealing \"secrets\" of the great minds of\nprevious generations, and gives us plenty of back story and interesting\nlaws that apply to \"Tomorrowland\" <br><br>5/7 would watch again.\n"},
{"review": "\nI went into this with somewhat low expectations, do to the poor box\noffice. I was more than pleasantly surprised. It was visually amazing.\nThe cinematography was so well done. A perfect combination of CGI and\ninteresting set locations. <br><br>Acting and casting was superb. Britt Robertson is one of the most\ncompelling young actresses. She has brought her A game to the big\nscreen. <br><br>If you can get around the global warming nonsense that creeps into\nalmost every film these days, Sort of like the cold war and Nuclear\nproliferation were in all of the films of the 60's and 70's., the plot\nis actually clever. I really enjoyed this picture and wish I had seen\nit in 3d. I think it may have a cult following in the future\n"},
{"review": "\nAbsolutely lovely! I'm 17 and saw this with my 8 year old brother, and\nwe both loved it! Dazzling special effects. Great Disney nostalgia\nright from the beginning. Really good acting, particularly on 11/12\nyear old Raffey Cassidy's behalf, who manages to be both convincingly\nrobotic and also human enough to be empathized with. George Clooney\nplays George Clooney as usual, what else could you ask for? The film\nalso has some pleasantly thought-provoking themes that left me\nwondering whether the villain was truly evil or not. To add to this,\nthe ultimate message of optimism that shines throughout the film is\nsomething lacking somewhat in films these days, and really makes this\none stand out from the crowd in the glut of super-high budget family\nfilms that have been produced in the last few years.<br><br>Now, important to add is that this is very much a kids' film. So maybe\nnot an appropriate film to see with your college or work mates on a\nnight out. And naturally, don't go and see this expecting masterful,\nsubtle storytelling or realistic dialogue. The story and dialogue are\nboth unabashedly silly, but quite frankly, why on earth would anyone\ncare? Don't go in expecting a storytelling masterpiece. Honestly, just\nsit back, let down your critical barriers and enjoy the magic of\ncinema.<br><br>And one more thing: If you're reading this in time, this is DEFINITELY\na film to see in the cinema while you can.

Not to mention the great direction and editing\nthat does not leave a spare second throughout its two hour length.\nDisney, ILM and Pixar. Lindelof and Bird.

Maybe some people does not\nliked because it touch sensible fibers about a very common and well\nknown message, or maybe because they believe that it was only to\npromote a Disney attraction, but even if that was true, doesn't\ndiminish the quality of the movie.

Britt Robertson (Casey) also does great and is another one\nto watch in the future.<br><br>The story is actually very timely and is something i reflected on after\nwatching the movie. It heads off with some background story before\nnicely introducing us to the characters. I was hooked all the way as we\nfollow Casey around though thick and thin. <br><br>Great movie and a bit low rated in my opinion. I would place it at 7.5\nand therefore i give it the benefit of the limits with an 8.\n"},

{"review": "\nI put off watching Tomorrowland because of all the negative reviews I\nwas reading. I have discovered from past experiences that sometimes I\nwill love the movie even if it has bad reviews,so I tried that with\nthis movie \u0096 and I am so glad I did. I have absolutely no clue as to\nwhy some people do not like this particular movie. I think it has to do\nwith the people of today and their spiritual vibe. Not anything\nreligious, just basic human spirituality here. This movie will be\nenjoyed by only certain people. People who's frequencies match. That\nmay sound like pure incoherent drivel, but trust me, it is far from\nthat. Tomorrowland is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.\nI have been around and have seen many movies too. Do not listen to\nthese negative nannies here on IMDb. I seriously believe that many of\nthem write negative reviews just out of pure malice.

{"review": "\nIt's rare for me to walk into a theater and watch a film that I\ninstantly love. Even more rare is when I get sucked into such a film,\nand loose my \"director's eye\" that exposes every angle, cut, and page\nfrom the script within my own mind. However, if there was such a\ndirector who's consistently done this, it's Brad Bird. The Iron Giant,\nThe Incredibles, and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol are some of my\nfavorites films of all time, and greatly inspired me as a filmmaker.<br><br>Yet, none of the previously mentioned films add up to how I feel about\nTomorrowland! It is one of those films you watch, and are never the\nsame afterwords. It takes a rather happy weekend and makes it even\nbetter. It uplifts you when you didn't realize that you were down, and\nperfectly stimulates your imagination! It enters your thoughts and will\nmost likely be there, somewhere, in the back of your mind by the time\nyou die. - It's a film you'll always remember.<br><br>Perfectly blending Cyberpunk AND Steampunk to create a fictional world\nis no easy feat. I probably would have said it was impossible before\nseeing Tomorrowland, but, now, am convinced that the two sub-genres can\nperfectly work together in harmony! The visuals, jokes, pacing, action,\nand acting are all on par - a staple of Brad Bird's films. While I\ncould see how some may pass up this film if they aren't ones for Back\nto the Future or The Rocketeer, everyone else will enjoy this film.<br><br>I feel like this is almost an understatement, but, I put Tomorrowland\nas my 3rd favorite film of all time! It's perfect, in every sense of\nthe word - maintaining a realistic image, while not taking itself too\nseriously. Tomorrowland has it all. I'm already fairly certain it'll be\nmy favorite film of the year. I'd recommend that everyone go see it\nsometime. It doesn't have the hype of something like James Cameron's\nAvatar, but easily deserves it!\n"},

{"review": "\nI loved this film! It's an earnest, hard-working story; it attempts the\nlofty goal of expecting the audience to WANT TO think beyond the\nfilm-going experience!<br><br>I believe that for Brad Bird, films are not the end-product but a\nworthy vehicle for grand ideas. Ideas change people - lives are bigger\nand more important than any film. This is true of all the films he's\nmade (MI excluded). <br><br>The ideas of this film are ambitious and difficult to spoon-feed. An\naudience expecting summer blockbuster fare like the Avengers, Furious\n7, Thor or any other \"tentpole product\" from a studio are bound to be\nleft wanting. Those films are pretty and amusing, but they are not\nattempting to make you think about what you as a viewer of a film are\nactually bringing to the world. <br><br>I believe that this exactly the point of the film. Some call it\npreachy, yet I suspect that those who do so were wanting the film to\nserve up the hoped-for spectacle and inconsequential emotional cadences\naudiences expect. <br><br>I feel the profound yearning in this film to affect change in the\nviewer. That is a testament to how much Brad Bird believes in his\naudience. There is a brilliant irony in the snarky disappointment some\nreviewers articulate - they are actually represented in the film!\n"},

{"review": "\nHollywood often tells us to deny our true emotions and find some way to\npretend that bad news is good, encouraging us to sit on the Titanic and\ncheer the upcoming iceberg. According to Hollywood, THAT is the\ndefinition of optimism and a positive attitude. Of course, this is not\nwhat anyone who has ever made history has ever done, and most people\nhave always known that such an approach to our fate is stupid, but\nwe've kind-of been brainwashed into apathy. This film was far\ndifferent. It reminds us that, if we don't like what we see ahead, we\nhave the option to CHANGE COURSE, to DO something about it. This\nmovie's definition of optimism is refreshing in that it reminds us that\nwe can control our destiny, rather than the message we are used to from\nthe media: that we are supposed to happily accept a prechosen destiny\nfor us, and try to see that preselected destiny through rose colored\nglasses. This was one of those movies that I had to watch more than\nonce before I could truly see what a clever and timely masterpiece it\nis. I'd had that experience before with the movies Thor and God's Not\nDead. Movies that initially seem simplistic but are actually deep in\nmeaning seem to be the new thing, but I appreciate the mental exercise.\nThis is one of those movies that will instantly appeal to kids, but\npeople over 35 may need to see it a few times. It will appeal to you\ntoo, if you give it a chance and honestly try to follow the message.\nFrankly, it may be a better message for older folks, since they\ncurrently have more power to change things than kids do. Right now,\nwhat we do impacts their future.\n"},

Then for whatever\nreason people began losing hope and stopped caring, stopped building.\nIt all became a self-fulfilling prophecy....but maybe it's not too\nlate, maybe if we can find people who have a that spark still in them,\nmaybe we can \"fix it\". That's the message of Tomorrowland. No, it's not\nan \"elitist\" message as some have suggested, it's not a left or right\nmessage either, it's a message of freedom. Free people, free to\nimagine, free to dream, free to create and build something for the\nbenefit of ALL. \"Man has dream, and that's the start, he follows his\ndream, with mind and heart, and when it becomes a reality, IT'S A DREAM\nCOME TRUE FOR YOU AND ME!\".<br><br>The 1964 Worlds Fair segment was an incredible recreation!

The science fiction is a bit\nvague, but uses well known concepts in interesting ways, borrowing from\nmuch that is past while creating a unique story that kept my interest\nthroughout. The casting is great, both for new comers and well\nestablished actors; having the brother be the Humanex from Extant was a\nnice touch.

Prometheus - aliens kill you.\nJurassic - dinosaurs kill you. 2012 - there is no hope to save the\nworld, but you can survive on ships (the effects are cool).\nInterstellar - still no hope to save the world, but you can survive on\nships, I mean spaceships (the effects are cool here either). Armageddon\n- Bruce Willis can save the world (I assume Bruce is too old now,\nthat's why we cannot save the world since '98), Die hard - kill the\nterrorists if you are a cop (actually that makes sense). As you can see\nit is really hard to find something supportive you could agree with or\nsomething which could have a positive effect on you. So I think this\nmovie is unique in this way and it is worth to watch. It's a shame that\nit is not made for adults many people could have learned from it.\n"},

{"review": "\nOne of those movies where I'm thinking the whole time, \"Man, is\neveryone else absolutely insane? This is great!\" It was very similar to\nanother live action Disney movie of recent years, The Lone Ranger. I'm\nnot sure what other movie people are seeing, but this is a highly\ninventive, interesting, fun, smart movie. It has its flaws, for sure,\nbut they're rather minor. Its big problem is that its so ambitious it\ncan't wrap it all up in a 2 hour package without being slightly\ndisappointing. We really don't get to see enough of Tomorrowland. The\nfilm follows teenager Britt Robertson, a smart kid who is interested in\nscience and has positive views of the future. She is chosen by a\nvisitor from Tomorrowland (Raffey Cassidy) to experience the wonders of\nher home. This wraps Robertson up in a strange conspiracy, where she is\neventually led to loner George Clooney so she can learn the truth. Much\nof the film is a chase sequence, with Clooney, Robertson and Raffey\nrunning from robots trying to hunt them. The film has a positive\nmessage and absolutely wonderful special effects and production design.\nThe main reason I was interested was the retro-future look from the\n1950s/60s, and you get a lot of cool stuff to look at (this is the rare\nfilm where I might think seeing it in 3D would be cool, particularly\nthe introductions to Tomorrowland). In addition to the three actors\nmentioned above, Hugh Laurie plays the villain (well, it is a Disney\nfilm, there has to be a villain). Keegan Michael-Key and Kathryn Hahn\nhave an amusing appearance early in the film, and I loved Matthew\nMacCaull as the robot with the creepy smile. The script (co-written,\nalong with Brad Bird, by one of the internet's most hated people, Damon\nLindelof) is far from perfect, but there's a lot to love here.\n"},

To add to\nthis, the ultimate message of optimism that shines throughout the film\nis something lacking somewhat in films these days, and really makes\nthis one stand out from the crowd in the glut of super-high budget\nfamily films that have been produced in the last few years.<br><br>Now, important to add is that this is very much a kids' film. So maybe\nnot an appropriate film to see with your college or work mates on a\nnight out. And naturally, don't go and see this expecting masterful,\nsubtle storytelling or realistic dialogue. The story and dialogue are\nboth unabashedly silly, but quite frankly, why on earth would anyone\ncare? Don't go in expecting a storytelling masterpiece. Honestly, just\nsit back, let down your critical barriers and enjoy the magic of\ncinema.<br><br>And one more thing: If you're reading this in time, this is DEFINITELY\na film to see in the cinema while you can. Get the benefit of the big\nscreen and surround sound while you can.\n"},

{"review": "\nHave We become so Cynical that a Fun Frolic of Super Special Effects\nsurrounding a Message for Our Time that has gone Unheeded despite the\nFact that the Signs of our Disconnect from Fixable Problems and the\nNeed for Reexamining Our Priorities and Abandoning Our Apathy, is met\nwith this Hateful Disregard.<br><br>Sure, the Preaching is well, Preachy, but what does Anyone Expect?

{"review": "\n\"Tomorrowland\" is a sci-fi adventure film with a beautiful\ncinematography and good cast, highlighting the gorgeous and talented\ngirl Raffey Cassidy. There is good action scenes and special effects.\nUnfortunately the story fails since does not provide explanation about\nTomorrowland. Is it an alternate dimension or a distant planet? How is\nexactly the connection between Earth and Tomorrowland and how does it\naffect Earth? Unless the viewer researches Internet, he or she will not\nfind the answer in the film. Maybe the intention is to make a prequel\nwith the missing explanation. But anyway it is worthwhile watching. My\nvote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Tomorrowland: Um Lugar Onde Nada \u00e9 Imposs\u00edvel\"\n(\"Tomorrowland: A Place Where Nothing Is Impossible\")\n"},
{"review": "\nTomorrowland has a lot of fresh and creative ideas, but its ambitions\nbecome over reaching, and the movie feel chaotic and out of control at\ntimes. There are many wonderful themes that are explored by this movie,\nbut the movie didn't quite expand on them enough in my opinion. There\nare decent performances from Clooney, Laurie, and Robertson, and there\nare some funny on screen moments with them. Their overall chemistry\njust added to the fun displayed on screen. I feel one of the biggest\nweaknesses, is that the movie wasn't fully developed within its 2 hour\ntimeline. Another problem is that the villain had weak character\ndevelopment and motivations. Overall, this movie is worth a DVD rental,\nand is worth watching once at home with your family, but doesn't\nwarrant a trip to the theaters.\n"},
{"review": "\nExceedingly bright and optimistic, Tomorrowland is a fun and uplifting,\nyet thought provoking film for both adults and children. It's a shame\nsuch an original work is being so under appreciated, I would highly\nrecommend going to see it.<br><br>In stark contrast with the majority of films these days, Tomorrowland\nbrings a sense of optimism and hope to the future. So often are we\nsubject in film to futures that are dark, grim, gritty wastelands that\nI forgot how refreshing a film about a bright and better future really\nis. Tomorrowland is director Brad Bird's most recent addition to his\nportfolio of already fantastic films (The Incredibles, the Iron Giant,\nRatatouille, and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol), and as much as\nthis film is getting panned by the majority of critics, it is very well\ndone affair.

{"review": "\nIt's hard to speculate whether like Avatar (2009) the novelty of the\nfresh new look of a movie has a lot to do with a movie's popularity or\nrating. In Tomorrowland there is both the initial nostalgic retro-feel\nof a glorified past 50s at the New York World's Fair which I did attend\nas a child and the fantastic images of a future that really never gets\nthe brilliant and spectacular vision of hope and optimism. Unlike the\nsci fi classic Blade Runner (1982) and its dark vision of Los Angeles,\nTomorrowland presents a different look. It's a look that is so\nenticingly omitted at the end of The Day Time Ended (1979) a rather\nmediocre sci fi movie that involves time travel.<br><br>This family Disney sci fi adventure has a family connection element, a\nchildren's element, and except for some deadly live action scenes that\nseems out of character for a family Disney movie, this entertaining and\nemotionally appealing movie captures a step above the ordinary sci fi\nmovie. Unlike Orson Scott Card's Enders Game (2013) there is more a\npersonal, relational dynamic that plays with fate, destiny, and\nimagination of the innocent, wondrous, special type.\n"},
{"review": "\nSo far I've only seen bad reviews about this movie , and since I had so\nmuch fun watching it last night and offcourse my moonsign is Libra I\nneed to equal things a little bit here and simply give it a 10 when in\nreality I would rate it 9 for Fantasy And FUN and maybe 5 or less for\nprobability because that is one of the aspects for the bad reviews I ve\nread so far. Written By Older people who watch maybe 1 or 2 movies a\nmonth they complained about the Improbability and Unlikelyhood of many\nthings that you will see in this movie. But in the end - I guess that\nis what really makes it a - FANTASY am I right ;) ... The 2nd reason\nfor the bad reviews was because they saw the trailer for this movie and\ndecided to go and watch it in the cinema. Now, because they paid to\nwatch it, they expected way too much of it , and in the end got\ndisappointed. Anyway, watching this movie was great fun for me and I\nhope that I will see more movies like this one. I just love this genre.\nUnlike those people who wrote the bad reviews I am someone who watches\nLots and Lots of movies and series and I can tell when a movie is worth\nto watch or not and this one IS... I didn't pay to watch it so I wasn't\ndisappointed at all and I will watch it again as soon as I find better\nquality version of it... In short - Kids and Teens will love it, also\nsome more open-minded adults ;) It is excellent Family watch... Just\nclose your eyes and say - Anything is possible - and you will like this\nmovie too, it isn't a scientific documentary, it is a FANTASY movie !!!\n"},
{"review": "\nI almost didn't watch this movie due to the reviews it received here,\nbut I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. What I found was that\nthe reviews stating they couldn't follow the storyline, or that it was\nsenseless or boring, or that it used pseudoscience most likely weren't\npaying attention, know little to nothing about science, history, or\nquantum mechanics, and like their movies to explain every detail in a\nnicely wrapped little package with absolutely no previous intelligence\nrequired.<br><br>This movie does require an ever so slight bit of intelligence to get\nthe most from it. It has historical references. I can almost hear\nwhoever's reading this groan, but you can relax, the references are of\nhistorical figures that anyone with an eighth grade education should\nknow. I stress the word should. Now the science and technical\nreferences are a bit more advanced, and they don't explain the science\nbehind it, so for someone that barely knows how to work their\nsmartphone I can see the assumption of pseudoscience, plus most people\nwill simply go \"SCIENCE\" or \"TECH\" and leave it at that. However for\nthose that are familiar with and do understand the references, such as\nthe use of tachyon particles, it's a nice little hat tip from Mr. Brad\nBird.<br><br>To sum it up, it's an overall enjoyable movie even if you don't get all\nthe references.\n"},
{"review": "\nI just saw this movie with my wife, my 2 teenage kids and one of their\nteenage friends. We all LOVED it! All 3 of the kids said it was one of\ntheir favorite live action movies in recent memory (all 3 really liked\nGuardians of the Galaxy as well). I can't see any reason for some of\nthe really negative user reviews except for perhaps for people who are\njust generally cynical about life in general. Or perhaps people who\ndon't like Disney in general, or don't like Brad Bird or George\nClooney? I'm not sure what it is. I'm a film major and as big a fan of\nmovies as anyone I know and I highly recommend this movie. The acting\nwas excellent all around. The screenplay was original. The soundtrack\nwas great.\n"},

The directing and editing are performed well enough. Being a\nDisney film does lend the over-all story and plot lines to have certain\npredictability - all of which is fine for me.

{"review": "\nI like this movie, well to say that I mean I like the movie up until\nthey get to Tommorowland. The movie up until they get to Tommorowland\nis richly original and fun to watch.

It was just such a fresh take on\nsci if and I was loving how it looked, but then we do go to\nTomorrowland and it sucks. That's when things are confusing, and don't\nreally excite as much as the first 60-70 minutes. I'm not saying\nremoving the arrival to Tomorrowland would've made a more interesting\nmovie, the movie just needed to make the Tomorrowland segment more\ninteresting. But for the film they are getting across I liked it fairly\nwell.

{"review": "\nTomorrowland (2015) Starring: George Clooney, Hugh Laurie, Raffey\nCassidy, Brittany Robertson, Thomas Robinson, Kathryn Hahn, Tim McGraw,\nJudy Greer, Keegan Michael Key, and Christopher Bauer Directed By: Brad\nBird Review Imagine a world where nothing is impossible. If the film is\ncalled Tomorrowland then why isn't about time travel. (it's a terrible\njoke). This is actually based on a Disney attraction that i'm guessing\nthat had to do something with a persons imagination and they would\ncreate wonderful things for this world. The film centers on a girl\nnamed Cassie(Britt Robertson) who finds this pin after she is arrested.\nWhen she touches the pin she goes to this amazing place called\nTomorrowland. But when the pin dies she tries to find out more about\nthis place while being chased by Security agents from Tomrrowland.\nAlong the way she meets Athena and Frank who help her try to save the\nearth and bring us to Tomorrowland. Before I saw this film I heard it\nwasn't that impressive which broke me to pieces. I honestly thought\nthis would be the best live action Disney film ever. That titles still\nbelongs to this years Cinderella. But a lot things buged people about\nthis flick, on the other hand only two of those problems I can agree\nwith, it's the inconsistent tone and ending where it's like save your\nplanet. We have seen that message a million times and it's been done to\ndeath. The inconsistent tones comes from how the movie can feel like a\nchildren's film, but then its a hard adult drama and then back and\nforth. Everything else I found to be fine with in the movie, the acting\nis great, the pacing is good and I still can't see what else there\nisn't to like about this picture. It's creative, imagnititve, fun, has\ngood characters and Brad Birds direction was impressive, not his best\nwork clearly but for a mis-step it's not that bad, it's a pretty great\nfilm. I'm giving Tomorrowland a four out of five.\n"}
