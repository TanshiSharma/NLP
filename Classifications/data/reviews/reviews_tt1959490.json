{"review": "\nEven though I had read a number of critical articles about Noah, I went\nanyway on opening day. I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt.\nEven giving it that benefit, it was one of the worst movies I have\nseen. I was not expecting a completely Biblical account of the Noah\nstory, and knew that additions to the story would have to be added,\nsince the Bible version is quite brief. However, who would have thought\nthat would mean weird talking Rock creatures, which looked like they\ncame from a Transformer movie. And the area where Noah lived was\ntotally barren rock....until he planted the seed Methuzalah gave him,\nand immediately an entire forest shoots up out of the ground, to supply\nwood to build the ark. When the \"flood\" came, instead of it starting to\nrain, huge columns of water were shooting up from the ground. What's\nwith that?<br><br>I was especially looking forward to the animal scenes, since the Humane\nSociety commended the director for not using any real animals in the\nfilming. Well, that was more than obvious! Computer animation has come\na long way over the years, but this movie apparently used one of the\nearliest versions of CG. It looked totally fake, and all occurred in\nabout a minute. <br><br>The acting was terrible, including Russell Crowe. And the script was\neven worse. After a very climactic scene, where he almost killed the\ntwin babies in a state of rage, he explains that \"All I saw was love.\"\nI almost left at that point!<br><br>If one reads all the reader reviews, I think it will become apparent\nthat most of the viewers agree with my comments. At the end of the\nmovie, our audience spontaneously let out an audible groan. I have\nnever heard such negative comments as people were walking up the aisle.<br><br>Save your money!\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat an utter waste of time.<br><br>I am by no means a die hard advocate of direct adaptation of a book to\nthe screen. So I entered the cinema expecting an enjoyable movie with\nsolid cinematography, great storyline and good acting - to be expected\nwith the director. Boy was I mistaken - granted the movie is extremely\nfar fetched (next to no authenticity in relation to the book of the\nbible), what killed it for me was the serious inconsistencies with the\ncharacter profiling, poor storyline and execution that made me want to\nleave the cinema midway. For example - Noah is portrayed as an earth\nloving greenie, protecting plants and life - point understood, but he\neasily kills people to protect another life? Further, later in the\nstory he is battling internal turmoil as they hear the screams of the\npeople of the earth? If his resolve lead him to kill humans without\nhesitation, why is his suddenly so challenged?<br><br>There was no clear cut message, no point to the movie and it seemed to\ndrag on. If the director intended to slide off in a tangent, at least\nmake it exciting to watch. Let me save you the waste of time and advise\nagainst watching it. Save your precious pennies and watching some worth\nyour time.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen putting on Noah I had heard a lot of negativity about this movie.\nI do not know if it is Christians not supporting this adaptation, or if\nit is atheists thinking it is way to much Christian propaganda. I am a\natheist, and I like good stories on the screen. What I liked about this\nmovie was that feeling of adventure the likes of LOTR and Star Wars, a\nmovie adaptation of a biblical story that is up there with other\nscience fiction and adventure films. It didn't make the story about\nNoah more plausible, but it was a great story, set in timeless\nenvironments. I have read the genesis story even though I'm not a\nChristian, and in my opinion this adaptation is quite accurate and true\nto the biblical story, with some tweaking here and there. A little\ngnostic view points here and there, but all in all something fresh made\nfrom a old and boring book, made a little bit more interesting. Have an\nopen mind, and don't watch it with an preconceived notion. Watch it\nlike you would with any other story made for the screen.\n"},
{"review": "\nJust watched this on Pay-Per-View having missed a chance to see in\ntheaters (dithered over whether or not to see it due to wildly mixed\nreviews). It was visually engaging enough to keep me watching till the\nend but as the credits began to roll, I found myself feeling\ndissatisfied. <br><br>Some of the scenery and shots featuring animals were really cool, I\nfound myself wishing for more (that is, more time spent on\nanimals...and a closer look at different species as imagined by the\ncreators of this film).<br><br>Ray Winstone is a distinguished actor but I found his portrayal at\ntimes creepy, at times laughable, overall weak (how much of this was\ndue to direction and/or other factors...not sure, when it comes to this\nfilm I didn't get a sense either way). Emma Watson and Jennifer\nConnelly impressed me, I got a sense of quiet strength from their\ncharacters.<br><br>Russell Crowe, also one of my favorite actors (I thought his Robin Hood\nwas masterful, a fresh new take), disappointed. Without giving anything\naway, there were some parts of this film that called for a more\ndramatic narrative...his timing and (at times) rushed speech took away\nfrom the grandeur of what was meant to be an epic film. You find\nyourself wishing he would deliver certain lines a bit more\ntheatrically, like David Wenham in 300 or one of the greats of classic\nfilm (Charlton Heston, perhaps).<br><br>I didn't realize when I started watching that Anthony Hopkins was also\nin the film. When he popped up on screen I laughed and thought: 'Of\ncourse...can't make an epic film without Anthony Hopkins!' Probably\njust me but it seemed a bit tired as far as casting goes. <br><br>I might have enjoyed it more on the big screen but don't regret\nwatching at home on my TV. Bottom line, entertaining enough to\nwatch...just a bit of a let-down.\n"},
{"review": "\nI found this movie absolutely stunning. Beautiful cinematography,\noutstanding acting, and astounding special effects. <br><br>Of course, there are a few things that fellow believers need to be\naware of. The movie, 'Noah', is not told from an ultra-conservative\npoint of view. There are multiple parts that can clash with your own\nbeliefs. When creation is explained in the movie, it is portrayed in\nthe fashion that God, or The Creator as He is referred to throughout\nthe movie, used the Big Bang as His tool for the creation of the\nuniverse, and evolution for His creation of animals and of Man.\nAlthough I do not personally believe that is how He created everything,\nthe movie tells creation beautifully and with God as the Creator,\ntherefore I do not find it offensive.<br><br>One piece of information that will be helpful when seeing this movie is\nthe background and origin of the Watchers. The Watchers are originally\nmentioned in the Book of Enoch, an ancient non-canonical book of the\nJewish religion. The Watchers are, as stated in the movie, fallen\nangels, but after that, the production team took their creative\nlicense. Since it is in neither the Jewish Tanakh nor the Christian\nBible, most viewers will think that the producers simply made up the\nWatchers.<br><br>Also, there are many gruesome and gut-wrenching scenes, for this movie\nreveals just how corrupt Mankind had become. There is no happy parade\nof animals arriving two-by-two, and Noah is not a happy old man with a\nlong flowing beard In this film, Noah tries to follow exactly what the\nCreator commanded of him, taking himself past his breaking point. In\nthis film, Mankind is scrambling for survival, taking what it wants and\nnot caring for anyone else. In this film, the story of Noah is\nportrayed realistically.<br><br>I implore you to go see this movie, but you must watch it with an open\nmind.\n"},
{"review": "\nWell I'm an atheist... but this movie made me pray on my knees to God\nto please stop my suffering and make me blind.<br><br>So Noah has visions, pretty short ones in my opinion and suddenly he\nknow's what's going to happen?<br><br>Movie makers tried to add elements to the movie to add action, drama,\nromance, etc. Only to make a really crappy plot.<br><br>So Noah had an paranoid schizophrenia episode he must have been\nsnorting \"crocodile\". ABSURD and then he goes sweet to the bottle?<br><br>Please don't waste your life or money on this movie.<br><br>Not even Emma Watson can save you from fleeing the theater.\n"},
{"review": "\nHaving watched the trailers, I was so looking forward to this film, and\neven took my friends. As the Bible account of Noah can fit into a page\nof A4, obviously the film makers had to add a lot of plot to fill it\nout to a feature length film. Indeed there is a lot of scope to do\nthis: Noah's wife and his three daughters-in-law are hardly mentioned\nin the Bible, not even being named, so the film-makers had to develop\ntheir characters, and could create interesting sub-plots around the\nvarious relationships. In the film Noah has a series of dreams about\nthe flood; now this is not mentioned in the Bible, but it is certainly\none of the methods God uses to communicate with men, so it is an\naddition rather than a distortion, and adds a bit of excitement and\ngives them a chance to show off their skills with CGI.<br><br>But to call the film \"Noah\" surely requires that they leave the basic\nstory-line intact. But they didn't. The angels who came to earth\nbecause they fancied the women were turned into bizarre stone men (very\nuncomfortable for the women, but they didn't go into that); as a\nconsequence the Bible description of what happened to their offspring\nhad to be abandoned. Instead of taking three daughters-in-law onto the\nark, they took one girl-friend, who Noah thought was infertile. One of\nNoah's enemies managed to sneak onto the ark without Noah's knowledge.\nPerhaps the worst thing, in my opinion, was that God was left on the\nside-lines, and couldn't even make the decision himself to preserve\nhumans or not, so left that decision to Noah.<br><br>So whether or not we agree with the personality they decided to give\nNoah is a matter of individual taste. Drugging the animals so they\ndidn't interfere with the film may have been a cop-out, but we could\nhave gone along with that. But playing fast-and-loose with the story\njust seems unnecessary. Who is the film aimed at?<br><br>All in all, very disappointing. Bring back Cecil B. DeMille!\n"},
{"review": "\nAm I compromised? Is this review tainted because I'm a Catholic\ncinephile? If you've seen my star rating than you probably figured you\ncan rule that out. I was excited, A film from Darren Aronofsky is an\nevent for me akin to the Olympics. That is, many years pass between his\nfilms, and when they arrive, they're freaking awesome. <br><br>Within the first few minutes, all my pent-up affection leaked away.\nDespite Noah's fervent source material (and that's as religious as I'll\nget in this review, pipe down) the narrative is extraordinarily weak,\nand the plot feels empty, despite the 138 minute runtime. The acting is\nterrible, especially from Emma Watson. (it's time we stop considering\nher an actress and call her what she is; a model) Even the brilliant\nJennifer Connelly uncomfortably shifts between hammy underacting and\ncringe-inducing overacting. There is no progression or cohesiveness,\nNoah is corrupted by a jumpiness that completely disconnects you from\nthe film. And it uses it's largely, if 100%, CGI landscape as a crutch\ninstead of a supplement.<br><br>But the real kicker, the REAL kicker, is that there is no evidence\nDarren Aronofsky had any part in this film. His trademark deep darkness\nisn't there, his infinitely interpretable script isn't there, and his\nquick-cut, close-up camera isn't there. You could've told me f*****g\nBrett Ratner directed this and I would've believed you.<br><br>It probably would've been more efficient for me to layout this review\nwith bullet points. Noah's whole ethos counters what I stand for. It's\nthe sort of blinged up executive express that takes a brilliant story\nin vain, and tries to pass as profound. I have nothing but contempt for\nthis movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis may well be the worst film I've ever seen at a cinema. It will\nsweep the board when it comes to the Razzies, I have no doubt about\nthat. Russell Crowe and Emma Watson are slightly above average but the\nrest of the cast may as well have been washed away in the flood. Even\nAnthony Hopkins's cameo as Obiwan Methuselah (use the seed, Noah) can't\nrescue this piece of celluloid crap. Some of the special effects are so\nbad I found myself rolling my eyes and the animal shots at the end must\nhave been nicked from a Walt Disney documentary from the 60s or 70s, so\npoor was the quality. The eco-warrior message of this movie overwhelms\nall else. Yes, we get it, we're all bad people for driving cars and\nowning gadgets. The cast and crew could've done their bit for the\nenvironment by not making this tosh. In hindsight, perhaps they wish\nthey had.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was stunned. There was no real reason to use the title \"Noah.\" I\nexpected this movie to be an attempt to make a new and edgy adaptation\nof the biblical story of Noah that reflects current social conflicts.\nIts not that. Its just a CGI action movie with all the standard\ntrappings and devices you expect in a recent-vintage CGI action movie.\nNothing more. This movie is so typical I was embarrassed for the\ndirector. Noah has been reduced to just another GI Joe Ninja Fighter.\nFurther, the premises are ridiculous and the continuity is\nhighly-questionable. Supposedly Cain's descendants created an\n\"industrial\" (The movie's word)civilization and ravaged the earth. The\nlandscapes are utterly barren. Then suddenly when its time to board the\nArk, there are millions of creatures. No explanation. There are a few\nattempts at insight, but these have very little relevance to the Bible\nstory. A waste of money and time.\n"},
{"review": "\nI can't believe this movie missed on so many levels. Forget about being\na true adaptation to the account in Genesis, but even being a viable\nfilm sustaining itself and just being decent. There are so many missed\nopportunities, wrong roads traveled, plot holes, weird plot devices,\netc. Arnofsky is a strange guy. If you've seen \"Black Swan\", or \"The\nFountain\" you know he is no stranger to trippy adventures with his own\nstyle and dynamic. I personally am not a fan of this style. At one\npoint he was attached to \"The Wolverine\" sequel, and luckily he didn't\nstay attached because I feel that would have been a blow Marvel may not\nhave recovered from unless they maintained enough production control.\nThe producers kept their hands in this movie as well which is why you\ncan at least recognize the story and maybe they are to blame for the\nlameness or weird decisions. Crowe salvaged this for me from being a\ncomplete and utter disaster. The end result is just\u0085pathetic.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is so far removed from the Biblical Story of Noah that it\nhas no resemblance to it. The only facts they got right was that there\nwas a man named Noah and his wife, and that he had three sons and he\nwas spared from the flood in an ark. The rest of the movie is pure\nfiction. I was very disappointed and feel I got ripped off. The makers\ncould have taken the Biblical story and taken some liberty with it, but\nto have these stone angels called watchers, God wanting to kill off ALL\nhumans, no wives for Noah's sons, Noah wanting to kill his\ngrandchildren because God instructed him to, when they show the\ncreation event they show it in an evolutionary form and etc. are so far\nremoved from the Biblical account. I also felt that the movie had\nsomewhat of a New Age view about it.\n"},
{"review": "\nI remember all the controversy while this movie was being made and then\npublicized. I'm sure many Bible fundamentalists were highly agitated,\nbut as the disclaimer at the end states, the movie is a fictional story\nwith fictional characters. Yet that too will upset all of us who\nbelieve Noah and Old Testament characters really did live.<br><br>But none of that upset me, I fully expected it to be a big movie with\nfictional elements and lots of special effects. So, how did it do,\nregarding what it tried to do?<br><br>I have to say very well. It was a costly venture, and likely will only\nrecover its costs with after-release DVD and BD sales, rentals, and\neventual TV revenue. But if you take it for what it is you get an\nentertaining movie.<br><br>Perhaps the most glaring departure are the large rock-like creatures\nthat eventually protect Noah, his family, and the Ark as the bad people\nattempt to overrun it. And the volumes of water spouting from the\nground which, along with rain, caused the great flood.<br><br>But the end has a tone of hope, that the surviving people will build a\nbetter mankind. Russell Crowe is always good and here he is good as\nNoah. He was paired again with Jennifer Connelly who was his wife\nNaameh. And Ray Winston was good as the villain Tubal-cain who managed\nto get aboard the Ark as it sailed, and who tried to kill off Noah.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen you go to the movies to expect a cool adaptation of the world's\nmost common Bible story, you expect I guess a Passion of the Christ\n(version of the story of Jesus's crucifixion), although don't even\nexpect that---unless you are a fan of giant rock monsters (angels)\nbuilding the ark (or long box boat) with a deranged Noah. <br><br>At first you are like (okay okay so they are giving a dramatic\ninterpretation I will let this slide) this attitude I kept up until the\nfollowing things occurred: A) A psychopathic Noah is \"God?\" inspired to\nprotect God's creation from man (translation: he is willing to kill\nanyone (anyone includes the people on the ark--yes his family) who\ngives mankind a surviving chance after the flood. The movie does TRY to\ntouch on God's mercy, but God's mercy is not even a thing to notice\nwhen the characters are either crying out to God to listen to them or\ntalking about being forsaken. B) Darren Aronofsky forsakes basic\nbiblical information such as all of Noah's sons having wives, but\nAronofsky gives only one of Noah's sons a wife, while the rest don't\nhave time to \"fetch\" some before the flood strikes, which abandoned\nanother aspect that this movie was trying to put across before\ncontradicting that too: God will provide. <br><br>This is literally the weirdest movie adaptation I have ever laid eyes\non.

{"review": "\nI went to see this movie with expectations that were not to be\nrealised. There were so many 'literary licenses' taken with Holy\nScriptures it defied belief.

This movie did none of those things.<br><br>Some of the additions to the story were: <br><br>- It made mention of \"watchers\", supernatural beings (angels) who\nwatched over Noah and his family.

(Terminator meets the Great Flood!) <br><br>- There was much made of the sons being discontent because they\nwouldn't be able to have wives and children and therefore be 'men' and\nNoah told them the reason for this was that mankind was to be\nexterminated too. But in Genesis (6:18)it says \"you will enter the ark;\nyou and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you\" <br><br>- The ark was also afloat long enough for Shem's wife to conceive and\ngive birth to twin daughters. In Genesis (8:14) it says that \"By the\ntwenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry\". <br><br>- the first born of Shem were Cain and Abel not as depicted in the\nmovie (I won't spoil it any more for you by explaining that!)<br><br>Very disappointing all round.\n"},

{"review": "\nDarren Aronofsky directed and wrote a story he wanted to tell. A drama\nabout the biblical Noah created with free creative license to tell the\nstory in a way that he felt would be compelling and entertaining. This\nis not the strict, or loose retelling of the traditional biblical\nNoah's Ark, nor is it a total fantasy, it takes elements from the\ntraditional story and uses them to create a watchable drama. If the\nflood story ever really had any truth to it, who knows for certain what\nthat truth was, unless of course you take whatever version of the bible\nyou read literally word for word. From the perspective of not knowing\nwhat happened for certain, Aronofsky creates a convincing story of\ncreation, man's wickedness, Noah's piety, and the flood. It's a fantasy\ndrama that makes for a very good movie. Unfortunately , this movie will\nupset devout Judeo/Christian/Muslims, because the story uses so much\ncreative license and strays so far from the biblical accounts. It even\nstrays far from older Babylonian flood myths. This movie will also\nupset atheists, because although it is a myth/fantasy/drama, it also\nhas a real sense of spirituality to it that will get under the skin of\nmost devout atheists. Additionally this movie will also irk any science\nfiction fans as it is much close to fantasy than any attempt at\nscientific explanation. Who's left to enjoy the film?

We are then introduced to Russell\nCrowes character teaching the children to respect the life of plants as\nhe then becomes a martial artist and deftly disposes of four hunters.\nIt was about then I checked the time remaining, and being just under 3\nhours, I could take no more.

{"review": "\nWhere has Darren Aronofsky been the last 4 years? Noah, that's where. A\nbizarre world of slightly off CGI creatures, talking rock monsters and\noverblown melodrama. If The Wrestler and Black Swan are comparable in\nstyle, then this is closest to The Fountain, another polarising venture\nthat took years to get off the ground. However, this one doesn't work\nquite as well, not having that thought-provoking existential angle that\nmakes The Fountain a profound experience. Not to say that Aronofsky is\nslacking here on the technical side, Noah still has his abrasive and\ncaptivating style with quick cuts and breath-taking cinematography,\nthough its production suffers from its concept. It's better to just\ntreat it like a fantasy film. Like the overly serious parts of Lord of\nthe Rings meets Jim Henson's campy 80s movies.<br><br>It results in a film that's really difficult to embrace but kind of\nenjoyable in a silly way. There are some great scenes, but they're\nadmirable for their boldness rather than their finesse. Its melodrama\nis hard to take seriously, especially when it tries too hard to make\nRussell Crowe's Noah a dark figure, giving him very unsympathetic\nchoices and obvious moral dilemmas. Otherwise the performances are\nquite committed and impressive, but suffer from the lack of character\ndepth, especially Jennifer Connelly. It has a lot to thank Clint\nMansell's exhilarating score for holding it all together but as a whole\nit just doesn't work. There's just too many bits that you don't\nbelieve, especially since many people take the Bible quite literally.\nNoah often leaves you awe-struck in what you're watching but not in a\ngood way. It is worth watching, at least, if just out of morbid\ncuriosity. Hopefully he'll bounce back with something down to Earth.<br><br>6/10\n"},

All the same I think this film has a good chance of\nreaching those who need to get the message about climate change and\nanimal rights the most. Noah presents us with an earth that is dying\nand will be flooded. Just like some scientists predict that the ice\ncaps may melt and flood coastal areas. Just as in our world, Noah's\nworld has naysayers as well. The film asks us to consider what a good\nperson is and why bad people act the way they do. With the level of\nsenseless violence that modern society is plagued by these are\ncertainly valid questions. Russel Crowe does a job of playing the sober\nNoah who is tasked with doing a job for God rescuing the innocent\nanimals.

Enter Hollywood (sigh).<br><br>Anyway, I've always thought of the Noah story as a bit too fanciful to\nbe true. As I understand it, the continental shift that landlocked\nAustralia from the rest of the world was already in place. Even if, by\nsome miracle, God created a landbridge between Australia and the land\nof Noah, two kangaroos would have had to hop mighty fast to reach him.\nAnd koalas (who sleep between 18-22 hours every day) would have to be\nstrung out on methamphetamines to make the same journey in a timely\nmanner.<br><br>My favorite high-fantasy film remains Cecil B.

{"review": "\nReview: What a epic movie! Personally, I thought that the film was way\ntoo long and it missed to key elements: animals and how he made the\nark. I loved the watchers and when they were fighting of the humans but\nfor some unknown reason, it really did drag. The son who was helping\nRay Winstone was annoying because he was willing to risk everything for\na girl that he only knew for 5 minutes. A thong Hopkins was brilliant\nand I was impressed with Emma Watson and Ray Winstone. The director\ndidn't really spend that much time on explaining the whole point of the\nark. He spent most of his time explaining how humans were destroying\nearth which could have been toned down a bit. At the end of the day, I\nwas expecting a much better movie to portray such a story but it is\nwatchable and enjoyable in parts.\u00a0<br><br>Round-Up: Russell Crowe hasn't really hit his peak as he did in\nGladiator, for some time. He's had plenty of chances to prove himself\nin movies like Robin Hood, Man Of Steel and Les Miserables, which\nwasn't that good in my eyes. I would put it down to bad choices more\nthan his performance, except for Robin Hood were he didn't know what to\ndo with his accent. Anyway, his performance isn't that bad in this\nmovie but the storyline could have done with some tweaking. Anthony\nHopkins can't do anything wrong. He's not really in this movie that\nmuch, but he stole the screen in every one of his scenes. After playing\nHermione in the Harry Potter franchise, Emily Watson shows a different\nside to her acting skills by bringing intensity and emotion to her\nrole. Basically, I did fall asleep whilst watching this movie because\nit was taking ages to get to the point and I couldn't believe that they\njust let one of the sons go off on his own without any argument but\nit's worth a watch.<br><br>Budget: $125million Worldwide Gross: $359.2million<br><br>I recommend this movie to people who are into there epic movie about\nNoah trying to save earth from destruction. 4/10\n"},

A\nbattle with Tubal-Cain and his people? well okay, I can accept that the\npeople who did not get on the Ark didn't want to just lay down and die,\nso I won't really pick that fight; there is a heavy Hollywood\nenvironmentalist spin with many examples in this movie.

Once you accept that this is at best a distant\nrelative of the Biblical Noah, then you can enjoy the movie the way\nyou'd enjoy any other imaginative special effects movie. The story\nflowed well, the effects were cool, the acting was good. I thought\neveryone in it did a good job. The only thing that really gave me pause\nwas that Noah's younger sons had no wives, and when the oldest\nbrother's wife gave birth to twin girls, Noah's wife joyfully said that\nthese girls would fill that role when they grew up.

It is a little\ndifficult to be attached with the characters cause there ids not much\ntime spent in understand them. My other problem is that I was expecting\nthe movie to be more metaphorical, taking the story we all know and\nmake it something else. I can't buy that someone takes orders from an\ninvisible master who however does not speak and does not question\nauthority. The whole concept of masters and slaves who only do their\nmaster'd biding seems silly to me.

Folks, movies are primarily for the purpose of\nentertainment. This movie isn't intended to be an exact portrayal of\nthe story in the Bible.

So Christians will hate it because it's\nunfaithful to the bible, and atheists will hate it because they were\nconned into seeing a heavily religious movie. (Before you say it- yes I\nKNOW it's based on a religious story. But it's far more heavily laid on\nthan in the trailer, which is more like an epic action film trailer.)\nMost of the screen time is taken up with pointless things that are\nnever explained, like magic snake skins and glowing rocks that can\napparentley create fire and guns. Oh, also there appears to be an\nabandoned mine with industrial revolution level technology which nobody\nin the film seems to possess- as rightly they shouldn't in biblical\ntimes. Also, Noah is basically a massive dick who is apparentley a\nvegan (nobody gets that built on a vegan diet) who cares about the\nsanctity of life, but casually kills people and leaves a girl to be\ntrampled to death without a second thought. The production values on\nthe film are bad- the credits and ending sequence looks like it was\nmade in the 90s- I can only assume this was on purpose? The last third\nof the film is taken up with a moral dilemma of whether to kill two\nbaby girls or keep them so they can have incest babies with their\nuncles. Nice.

A lot of\nthe family drama that felt a bit forced on first try, was moving and\ninvolving on the second. In particular, there's a deeply moving and\nmemorable 'human' scene, when Jennifer Connolly finally stands up to\nNoah's determination to wipe out mankind. Her emotional power and fury\noverwhelm even Noah's (and Crowe's) strength.<br><br>That said, many of the film's best bits are it's visions and 'non-plot'\nsections, as when Noah tells his children the story of genesis while we\nwatch a super speeded up flow of the evolution of the universe, then\nearth, and then life evolving, finding a sort of connection between\nDarwin, science, and still having a spiritual feeling about the world.\nPowerful too, the few second montage of man going from ape to 20th\ncentury man in silhouette, while showing his violence in each step,\njust a few frames long.<br><br>On the other hand, there are still \u0096 for me \u0096 sizable flaws, from\nannoying lapses in logic (some the fault of the original story, not\njust Aronofsky Like, if there are only 2 of each animal, how did we\navoid a world of doomed inbreeding?).

Throw in some good\nactors, uneven special effects along with plenty of action and the end\nresult was nothing resembling the Biblical narrative. But the shame of\nit all is that this movie would have probably been much better had the\nwriters not strayed too far from the ancient script because it became\nquite apparent that these modern, highly-educated writers weren't\nnearly as capable as their predecessors over 6000 years ago. Think\nabout it\u0097they had all of the resources of the modern world at their\ndisposal and the end result wasn't nearly as good as the original story\nwritten thousands of years earlier.

Be that as it may, if a person can disassociate the movie from\nthe original Genesis account then it's possible that there may be some\nredemptive entertainment value to be gathered from it all. Both Russell\nCrowe (as \"Noah\") and Jennifer Connelly (\"Naameh\") put in fine\nperformances and the special effects involving the flood was also\npretty good. Unfortunately, the special effects pertaining to \"the\nWatchers\" needed significant improvement and certainly didn't help this\npicture in any way.

Unfortunately, they\nfell flat.<br><br>This is a story about Noah's Ark, twisted into a kind of SyFy Dystopian\nwith rock monsters. While the animation of the rock monsters is pretty\ncool, their back story and involvement into this world feels very\nforced and a bit hokey.<br><br>But these are surface issues, really. The real reason this movie didn't\nwork is because it was all over the place. It tried to be epic, but the\nstoryline kept bouncing around. The main character of Noah was\nimpossible to sympathize with, even before the very weird turn where he\n(spoiler alert) made the decision to do without humans in the new\nworld. Why? Because he was just so flat. When you're making a movie\nabout a story everyone already knows, you have to include a twist on\nthe characters, not just overlay it with a science fiction element. But\neven if this weren't the case, within the very challenge of building\nand ark and accepting the awesome responsibility of the survival of the\nworld's creatures, Noah doesn't really seem to be struggling. I don't\nreally think this is Russell Crowe's fault either. There just wasn't\nmuch in the writing to bring the audience into some of his world.<br><br>And then when the floods hit, things got really weird and out of place.\nIt's like they writers were operating under two messages/themes\nthroughout and tried to bring it together to one in the end. Sadly,\nthis just made it feel more like a convenient gimmick than a strong\nmessage.<br><br>There's enough intrigue with the SyFy elements to hook you in, but the\nmovie falls flat on its face. Not one I'd ever recommend to anyone,\nunfortunately.\n"},
{"review": "\nDarren Aronofsky's Noah is a visionary retelling of the classic Bible\nstory regarding Noah and the Great Flood. The movie definitely does not\nstay true to its source, but I could use a fantasy retelling without\nsacrificing the main themes, and that is exactly what we got. Of course\nthere are no talking rock monsters or volcanoes in the real story, but\nit added a Lord of the Rings style to the movie. The visuals are\nimpressive, and that is evident during the scenes where the animals are\nmoving towards the ark. <br><br>Aronofsky's film is about Noah and his creation of an arc for him and\nhis family due to God's displeasure at mankind by creating a flood.\nNoah must battle with himself and other mankind if he wants to\nsuccessfully be a part of God's vision. <br><br>The film is well-acted and features magnificent performances from\neveryone. Russell Crowe does a very fine job as Noah and his acting\nskills are at its peak during his inner fights when he has to make very\ndifficult choices. Jennifer Connelly did a great job as his wife. Ray\nWinstone delivers a delicious performance as Noah's manly nemesis. Emma\nWatson and Logan Lerman deliver great performances. Finally, Anthony\nHopkins makes a surprising, but good cameo as Noah's grandfather. <br><br>Overall, this was a fantastic action/adventure film. The story is a new\nspin on the classic Bible tale and I really enjoyed it. It's funny to\nsee how many people wanted a true, faithful adaptation. I just wanted\nentertainment and this film does its job very masterfully. It Makes\ngood use of the CGI and I was impressed with the rock people. Noah is\nnot an action hero in reality, but he made a good one here. One of the\nbest films of early 2014, and it seems I'm one of the few partaking in\nthat thought. <br><br>My Grade: A+\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is not true to the \"Bible\" story that we have seen on screens in\nthe past.

I did think Russel Crowe was excellent in his role as\n\"Noah\" and some of the CGI was incredible with other parts looking a\nbit Naff.

In what should have been a great biblical tale it turned\ninto some kind of weird indescribable neo-fantasy where the director\njust kind of rewrote that chapter of the bible.

{"review": "\nI have to say that I was partially disappointed when I saw the movie,\nNoah. What I liked was that the story matched many theories about the\nflood that people have suggested, including the water coming put of the\nground and not just rain. And many historians have shown that an ark\nwas more likely built in the shape as it was shown in this movie, than\nthe middle age interpretations that most of us recognize today as\nNoah's ark, which resembles middle age boat architecture. The part that\nmade some sense to me was the portrayal of real human behavior. Put\ninto the same situation, most humans would behave and be as barbaric as\nthey (the wicked) were shown in this movie. Put into less of a\nsituation, many humans still act that way. Anyone that has been at the\nopening of a Black Friday sale would know what I mean.<br><br>I feel that the angel characters weakened the movie. While many\nreviewers were reminded of transformers, I was reminded of the the Rock\nBiter in the \"Never Ending Story\". They even sounded like the Rock\nBiter.

Noah didn't seem to do\nany collecting of the pairs of animals required for the Ark; they just\nembarked like passengers going on a cruise. The whole atmosphere of the\nmovie is gloomy and sombre, and even though the weather was obviously\nbad during the rains, the beginning of the film is no different. The\ndialogue is slow and laboured, and really does nothing to give the\nstory a nice and even flow. The 'watchers' - quite a big joke really,\nthey look exactly like transformers made out of rocks.

{"review": "\nNoah (2014): Dir: Darren Aronofsky / Cast: Russell Crowe, Jennifer\nConnelly, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Watson, Ray Winstone: Perhaps the worst\nexcuse for a Biblical movie ever made. Darren Aronofsky has directed\nsuch great visual films as Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan but here\nhe presents a pathetic charade that barely scratches the surface on the\naccount in Genesis where Noah is given visions from God to build an ark\nfor he and his family as well as two of every animal because God was\nset to destroy the earth via flood due to man's rebellious nature. We\nhave giant rock creatures that were apparently fallen angels. We have\nrebellious attitudes from Noah's son Ham in regards to mating, which\ngoes against the fact that Genesis states that Noah's children were on\nboard with their wives. Russell Crowe plays Noah as a barbaric nut case\nwho battles enemies including an ark stowaway that results in a brutal\nfight. Jennifer Connelly plays his wife. Anthony Hopkins is totally\nover the top as Noah's father who lives in the mountains. Emma Watson\nplays a young female found who could not bare children and is touched\nby Hopkins and given the ability. Then she bangs one of Noah's sons and\nhas twins, which Noah nearly daggers. Finally we have a useless\nappearance by Ray Winstone as the film's villain. He apparently stows\naway and gets into a fist fight with Noah. Christians are at opposites\nends with this film and despite it getting some folks looking at\nscripture for themselves, it doesn't change the fact that the story is\nmoderated to action, violence, and a visual world that doesn't fit.\nThis film should be flushed down a toilet.

Well, let me tell you if this\nmovie is one thing, sure isn't Aronofski...It is not also a religious\nmovie.Any similarity with known names and persons is purely\ncoincidental, I would rather say. So, I thought myself \"ok, cool down,\nmaybe Aronofski wants to explore other ways of cinematography and make\na turn to the blockbuster kind\", but still he is very far away from\nthis kind, since neither the graphics nor the idea of them is something\nso pioneer and spectacular (with some small exceptions during the first\nscenes of the flood). I did watch the whole movie though, until the\nlast torturous second, in honor of the actors, who are great and do the\nbest they can. I suppose Mr Crowe must have imagined that he would play\na role for the Oscars, when he first red the script, another Gladiator\nof older times maybe, so it is really a pity that the director did not\nmake a movie strictly with profound characters and lack of so much\nuseless blood and moving/speaking rocks (even if they are supposed to\nbe fallen Angels)! Mrs Connelly is as always adorable and touching, Ema\nWatson and Logan Lerman are included in the promising actors of next\ngeneration, Ray Winstone always puts a little something with his role\nand Antony Hopkins was just with a bad make-up! To conclude it is a\ngreat pity to have this cast, a story from the Bible that could be\ntransformed into Aronofski's hands into divine scenario and instead of\npure magic, you get this.It is truly disappointing and I really hope\nthat the director goes back to lower budget movies through which we all\nloved &amp; appreciated him.\n"},
