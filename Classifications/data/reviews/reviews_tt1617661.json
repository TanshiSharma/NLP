{"review": "\nThe movie feels like it was written by a ten year old girl hooked on\ndrugs. Cardboard characters are so undeveloped that they should have\nstayed in authors womb for few more months/years. Bad acting and \"I\ndon't care about what is going on\" attitude from the actors brings\nfinal nail to this movie coffin. There is nothing substantial in this\nmovie, nothing that can teach us something new about ourselves or the\nworld around us, which is quite odd for the science fiction movie. True\nthe cinematography of the movie is first class, but it only saddens me\nthat it is used on such bad material. In the end don't get fooled by\nthis movie. Its only purpose is to take your money with bright lights\nand a false promise, but it will leave you with a mouth full of ash,\nwondering why you wasted your time.\n"},{"review": "\nThis was easily one of the worst movies I have ever been to. What else\ncan be said. Everything about it was just awful. And I went in knowing\nit was going to be a terrible story, but maybe I would enjoy the\nspecial effects and action scenes. Unfortunately, a man-dog wearing\neyeliner roller skating in the air fighting bad guys looks as\nridiculous and dumb as it sounds. Mila Kunis felt completely miscast\nand had no chemistry with Channing Tatum, who was playing the same\nboring dumb hero he always does. The action sequences were a mess...\nimpossible to tell what was going on.<br><br>I watch a lot of movies and have only walked out on a handful in my\nlife, but I could not make it through more than 70 minutes of this\nridiculous film. Don't waste your time. It's awful.<br><br>It boggles my mind how a movie like this gets made. Someone please stop\nthese two from making any more!\n"},{"review": "\nGuys, this movie was a joke\u0085 It seems like they took all the extra\ncostumes from 'Flash Gordon', 'CG from any Transformer movie,\n\"screenwriting\" from 'The Last Starfighter', and character development\nfor 'Gigli' and overall logic from 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai\nacross the 8th Dimension' and put them together!<br><br>Basic breakdown\u0085<br><br>Act I. Kidnap + Rescue + Channing Tatum on magic roller-skates +\nRedmayne Overacting<br><br>Act II. Kidnap + Rescue + Channing Tatum on magic roller-skates +\nRedmayne Overacting<br><br>Act III. Kidnap + Rescue + Mila Kunis on magic roller-skates\n"},{"review": "\nI saw Jupiter Ascending tonight (after a VERY long wait I might add).\nSadly it is not in the vain of other Wachowski films in terms of\nthought- provoking subject matter; however, I feel this film is being\nvery unfairly criticized. <br><br>No: the subject matter is not as deep or profound as in The Matrix, V\nfor Vendetta, or the masterful Cloud Atlas. But it was never advertised\nto be that kind of film--it's a solid blockbuster movie (with plenty of\nroom for sequels and/or prequels). I'd see it again!<br><br>If you're considering watching this film, but hesitate after reading\nthe same scathing reviews that I came across, just consider what\ninterests you about the movie: if you're looking a movie with a complex\nplot and lots of underlying messages, this might not be the best\nchoice. It's a blockbuster film pure and simple. A good one! But a very\ntypical blockbuster/action/romance movie.\n"},{"review": "\nJupiter Ascending, a film that deals with subjects that I'm sure a\nmillennia old advanced species would have no interest in, such as\nwealth, materialism, physical appearances and girl crushes. A totally\nshallow film with not a single redeeming feature. The Wachowski\nBrothers should be ashamed of themselves. It was a good job we had a\ngift certificate because if we had spent the full \u00a320 on the film I\nwould have been mortified. I walked out before the end of the film as I\ndidn't care the slightest about the fate of any of the characters and\nit was pretty obvious that the ending would be a complete happy ending\nclich\u00e9. These sorts of films make me want to give up on the modern film\nindustry, they only spew out high budget garbage to appease the idiots.\nExcuse me while I go watch some Hitchcock or something. Urgh.\n"},{"review": "\nSo..yes, this isn't the best sci-fi movie in existence, but I don't\nthink it's half as bad as everyone is saying. Let's start by the\nvisuals. The visuals are AMAZING and are what makes this movie worth\nseeing on the big screen. The universe the brothers created is\nhuge,which gives room for a lot of breath-taking scenes. This however,\nis one of the drawbacks of the film. The fact that the universe is so\nbig and that it is a 2 hour film, makes the story a little sloppy.\nThere are a lot of things left unexplained which is a pity,and too much\ntime filled with love scenes. Moreover,the characters are either good\nor bad, there's not much depth to them. Despite all this, the movie is\ngood, I decided on 7 instead of 6.5 mainly because of the visuals. You\nneed to consider this movie as a sci-fi flick, taking into account that\nyou don't see many original sci-fi movies around,and that the plot\nisn't that bad,it's just not mind blowing, I'd encourage you to see it\nfor yourself, grab some popcorn and enjoy the movie for what it is.\n"},{"review": "\nJupiter Ascending sucks.<br><br>The movie has a plot that is way too complicated. Just when you think\nthe movie would end, it drones on and on about another \"twist.\"<br><br>In addition, there are too much disasters. Is this a fricking disaster\nfilm or what? Jupiter makes too many stupid choices, which is averted\nby a \"rescue\" by the male lead. This makes the film too predictable. I\nwill give you two example, one is that she agrees to a sham wedding to\nsave the earth. Another is when she agrees to give up her property to\nsave her family. Can you figure out how she gets out of these? If you\nsaid she was saved by the male lead, you guessed it right.<br><br>Is there such thing as too much action? Apparently so. With fight\nscenes that last over 2 minutes and are too \"action intense\", we don't\nknow who is fighting whom. This quickly make the action boring.\n"},{"review": "\nI must say, the critics of this film seem overly harsh. If nothing\nelse, the film is worth seeing for the special effects. I thought Mila\nKunis was better in Black Swan, but she wasn't bad in the lead role.\nThe plot was very strange, but that is what the Wachowski's do best. A\nlot of small rolls and cameos from big stars. And I wish Doona Bae had\na larger role, as she stole the show in Cloud Atlas.I can see, why this\nmovie cost 175 million dollars. The sets were brilliant and very\nimaginative. The 3d was also cool. If you are looking for something\nwhich isn't your boiler plate science fiction, give this film a day in\ncourt.\n"}
