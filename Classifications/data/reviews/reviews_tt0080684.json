{"review": "\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy.\nIt has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great\neffects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of\nspellbinding action.  It also has eliminated some of the problems that\nplagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into\ncharacter development.  The performances are terrific, especially by\nHarrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian.\nGeorge Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence\nwith the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film.  The\nconclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker,\nis truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire\nseries.  This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder\nthat just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that\nit has to be shallow and two dimensional.  This film will undoubtedly\nentertain viewers of all ages from start to finish. \n"},
{"review": "\n\nMy five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came\nto the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme\nof conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our\nimaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange\nworlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting\naround a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of\nlanguages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space\nships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how\nabout the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the\nspeed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights.\nThe Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.<br><br>It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because\nthe first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be\nthe 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes\nBack' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie\nwhich has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other\ntwo original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs\nfinally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should\nexpect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture\nis nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. <br><br>My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star\nWars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our\nlocal public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these\nmovies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made\nto compare to them.\n\n"},
{"review": "\nAn excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most\nserious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the\nSith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a\ndiminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown\nwith Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old\ngambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams.\nEmpire is more character driven than the original and relies more on\ncomic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with\nthe humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well.\nDespite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than\nthe original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that\nnone of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at\nleast on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in\nwhat is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of\ncinema.\n"},

{"review": "\nI cannot believe some people out there didn't like this film, yet claim\nto have enjoyed Episode One. No comparison whatsoever. \"The Empire\nStrike Back\" is George Lucas' best contribution to human history, and\nit will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have\ngone the way of the Do-Do Bird. The optical effects still stand the\ntest of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and\nCarrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars,\nhaving fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story\njust keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to\ncities in the sky, everything in this film works. So ignore anyone who\nclaims to dislike it, and see it for yourself if you haven't already\ndone so. 20 out of 10!!<br><br>Oh, and Han Solo shot first! =)\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWhile the Titanic made all the rich people (with the exception of Molly\nBrown and Rose) automatically uncaring, snobby, and thoughtless just\nbecause\nthey were rich and needed a couple of villains for the story, The Empire\nStrikes Back did not portray \"the villain\" in a completely evil light.\nSympathy is induced when we see the back of Darth Vader's scarred and\npasty\nhead.  When he tells Luke of their blood relationship, some feeling is\nallowed to creep in, telling us that he is not just some maniacal killing\nmachine, but a human, fallen from grace, yet able to retain some sense of\nlove, however twisted it may be.\n"},
{"review": "\nI literally watched this movie about twenty times when I first got it,\nVHS , a box-set of the original three. But this one is best! It was the\nmost exciting, it kept you on the edge of your seat and your mind the\nwhole way through. Although, I have to say, Lucas has become very lazy\nin the Star Wars saga since the Phantom Menace, which was quite poor.\nThis is vintage Lucas and this your vintage space movie. Star Wars (any\nof the original 3 and Episode 3) is a must see! It includes many\nhousehold names. Some, though, hate Star Wars with a vengeance. Those\npeople lack in creativity and are subject to boring, lack-luster films.\nAll I can say is have fun because I know you won't for missing out on\nthis 5-star, one of a kind classic. Must see, it's too great for a 10\nout of 10 rating. It was way ahead of its time. It's a film of the ages\nand has caliber modern films dream to re-create!\n"},
{"review": "\nI am A Star Wars fan, always have been. The difference was the\ndirection in this film there were standards set. The Imperial Theme is\none of the most well known themes and has been repeatedly parodied\nalthough it has kept respectable as time wears on.

The budding romance between Han and Leia was a\nsurprise when I first saw this. I thought for sure Luke would get it on\nwith her, but Lucas had other plans which I was really happy about.<br><br>The suspense is really built and when I was seven years old watching\nthis film I hung on every word. I still do. The real difference is the\ndirection and the attention to detail. The asteroid scene was new. John\nWilliams thematics set the cornerstone of the film and a relentless\nchase through the stars for Luke Skywalker by a driven Dark lord is\nanswered at the climax. The screenplay is more mature than the original\nand any of the others following. It is what is left unsaid that carries\nthis film and makes it highly re-watchable.<br><br>I'm going to give this film a nine it still excites me and is the real\nbeginning of the story and for all it's worth I appreciate the prelude\nto it as well. This film delivers the emotional punch that has captured\nfans for decades and cemented a niche in the industry. Enjoy\n"},

Action scenes are\nexcellent, thought of meticulous way and the fight scenes with\nlightsaber remind us some great duels of piracy and swashbuckling\nfilms. The special visual and sound effects are the best that existed\nat the time and fulfill their role with great merit. The only\ndifference between this film and the latest films of the saga is, in\nfact, this technical issue, given the huge advance that, in a few\ndecades, the techniques and special effects achieved. The soundtrack\nwas again in charge of John Williams, which continues the excellent\nwork started in the first film of the saga. In fact, the first main\ntheme of the chords of the saga became one of the songs that\ninstinctively comes to mind of people when they think of film music,\nthe same way as the \"March of Darth Vader\" has become one of most songs\ninstinctively associated with the image of any movie villain. The point\nof greatest merit of this movie is the script.

{"review": "\nThis film is incredible. I am so thankful for George Lucas and his\nboldness in writing it. I have watched quite a few documentaries on the\nStar Wars series and each documentary gives me more and more\nappreciation for the three films that came out in the 70's. Lucas took\nquite a risk with the Star Wars franchise and it (obviously) paid off\nfor him. If you haven't, I would definitely suggest looking up some of\nthese documentaries in order to see what the project was actually like\nwhen it was first made. The crew and cast describes it as a lot of\nchaos and self-doubt until its first debut when it gained its cult\nfollowing. The way that Lucas wrote and directed these films is a\ntribute to his true genius and success.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Empire Strikes Back is one of the few movies I call pitch perfect.\nEverything is flawless- the action? Edge of your seat! The drama?\nHeart-wrenching and powerful! The comedy? Frequently clever and\nhysterical! The special effects? Better than A New Hope, and then some!\nAs for the 2004 DVD version, it still has the original flavor of the\ntheatrical cut, the touches are few, and still has most shots from the\noriginal version. Also, may I add that all of the characters are\nperfectly developed and lovable, villain or hero. Han Solo is a great\ncharacter in this, all because of his charming and awesome performance\nby Harrison Ford. My favorite character from Star Wars is Chewbacca,\nand there is no exception here. The stop motion animation done with the\nAT-ATs and the Taun-Tauns still are amazing today, and the wonders of\nthe ship battles are just as beautiful. Overall, Empire is my favorite\nStar Wars, and one of my favorite movies. It has everything- heart,\nhumor, action, drama, suspense.

Though Luke's reaction to this reveal is often\nmocked and even I cannot help but chuckle sometimes, I think it's\nentirely appropriate.

{"review": "\nESB is one of the best science fiction movies of all time.

The first star\nwars movie was a feat in special effects and something quite new. The\nEmpire Strikes back, however, drew us into a new world with an amazing\nconviction. We were all so very much standing next to Luke and Han, so\nthat they have almost helped share their world with us, but also\ninfluence popular culture today in a somewhat surrealistic concept,\nwhere the actors/actresses step out of the TV/silver screen and dictate\nthe 'real' world, using their 'fantasy' world to justify for their\ncandor - in an almost 'emperor's new clothes' fashion. Only the\ngreatest movies have the ability to enmesh reality and the fiction on\nthe screen. Lord of the Rings did it, Hitchcock did it, and Lucas did\nit!

Everything\nthat was begun in Star Wars was expanded and improved upon here, right\ndown to the score Remember, this was the movie that introduced the\nnow-famous and ridiculously overplayed Imperial March composed by John\nWilliams. And virtually every scene is now iconic--the Imperial Walkers\nin the snow, Luke's training in the swamp, the asteroid field chase of\nthe Millennium Falcon, the Cloud City, Luke's lightsaber battle with\nVader. When I think of \"Star Wars\", most of the images that come to\nmind first are from Empire. The colors and textures of the film are so\nsharp and rich.<br><br>A truly majestic film. One of the great visual statements in the\nhistory of movies, and one of the most successful realizations of a\nmovie vision we will ever see.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's very rare when a sequel outshines the film that came before\nit,\"The Empire Strikes Back\" manages to do that in many ways. \"Star\nWars\" always will be considered an all time classic,but \"Empire\" is a\ngreat follow up.<br><br>According to George Lucas,It's \"Episode V\" in his space opera. In my\nopinion it's the best in the series.<br><br>The characters are more fleshed out this time,and the plot is more\ncomplex and darker then the previous installment.

Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to\nbecome a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more\ndifficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.<br><br>With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a\nlight-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a\nchase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre\nduel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father,\nit's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best\nof the series.

They dance alongside the camera, swooping\ntoward and away from us. Look at the terrain whiz by in the snowspeeder\nsearch. No CGI can convince like that. This is basically helicopter\nfootage on fast-forward, through the cockpit of a prop ship, but it\nworks. The amount of activity going on screen at any given time is\nfrenetic.<br><br>And then we have Frank Oz. Forget that we live in a world where there\nare Yoda pajamas, animal crackers, dolls, etc., and just focus on this\nwonderful character in this one film. He is more lifelike than many of\nthe actors we have working today. When he is on screen, I believe he\nexists. That is pure movie magic. Mark Hamill is given a tough job with\nthis. Whenever you have a multi-million dollar film that hinges on the\nperformance of one person and a sock puppet, there's pressure. People\nhave blasted him for years over his acting, but it works. He pulls his\nshare of the work and sells every scene.<br><br>From the opening crawl onward, this never lets up. The music is simply\nbeautiful. This is why I go to the movies.\n"},
{"review": "\nAnd damn if it didn't deliver the goods and a helluvalot more.

It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just\ndidn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool\nsuspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's\nbudding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering \"the world is\nnot flat it's round\" surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas\nwrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing\nmaniacally and saying \"Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two\nbillion light years!\" or crying with joy all the while with the one\nidea that \"This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the\nend of time and even after that.\" As Hamill said so eloquently, \"In the\nEmpire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has\nproblems, they turned Han into a coffee table!\" I must also include\nSilent Bob's quote \"She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I\nknow'.\" It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the\naudience.

The \"I am\nyour father\" scene is no doubt the most famous single scene in film\nhistory, as well as one of the most shocking twists in any film ever\nmade.

This is one of many factors that\nmake the original trilogy by far the superior films. The plot is also\nmore complex then the first of this trilogy which shows that the people\ninvolved with this project were taking risks. The characters were all\nlikable and interesting. And the fact that they filmed at real\nlocations shows dedication from the director Irvin Kershner.<br><br>The cons of this picture though are not minimal which leads me to\nfeeling as though it is grossly overrated.

{"review": "\nThe Empire Strikes Back is a 1980 epic space opera/space fantasy film\ndirected by George Lucas and direct sequel to Star Wars. As a brief\nsummary, The Empire Strikes Back is a classic example of a movie that\nthe critics of the time got very wrong. Initially receiving mixed\nreviews and being slammed by some is nowadays considered to be one of\nthe greatest movies of all time and the best Star Wars film\noverall...and its not hard to see why! The Empire Strikes Back\ncontinues on from the events of Star Wars revisiting the characters of\nLuke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo. The Empire Strikes Back is\nknown to be the much darker sequel, with much more character depth,\nvulnerability and emotion. Lucas continues to develop his beloved\ncharacters in all the right ways with the Han-Leia relationship, the\nmore powerful feeling of friendship and of course the biggest, most\nshocking twist in cinematic history with Vader and Luke in the final\nact of the film. The Empire Strikes Back also continues to evolve the\nworld introducing us to new places, new characters such as the\nlegendary Jedi master, Yoda, improving the special effects and an even\nmore beautiful soundtrack, provided by John Williams. The Empire\nStrikes Back is a perfect example of a sequel done right, equal and at\ntimes even better than the original. Epic battles, intense space\nchases, powerful emotional character development, shocking twists,\nthought-provoking ideas, themes and messages and finally groundbreaking\nsequences and special effects. In terms of flaws The Empire Strikes\nBack virtually has none whatsoever, other than an unfortunate twist\nwhich has had a negative response later on in the franchise, a few\nunnecessarily long scenes of Luke's training, and in my opinion a\nslightly weaker general plot than the original story. These however\nbarely affect this near perfect masterpiece of a movie. 9/10\n"},

It had an emotional climax. There were something\nabout Empire that immediately just clicked when I saw it. I did not\nknow how all the romance between Solo and Leia were going work and the\nadventure and were it too serious, and all this sort of stuff. But it\nreally came together.

{"review": "\nTop of the line for a majority of Star Wars geeks, and for good reason.\nIt's the ideal melting pot of George Lucas's vast, quirky imagination,\nhis influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key\ncontributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst\nall the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. A wildly ambitious\npicture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over\nthe course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth\nbattle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City,\nbefore finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and\nrevelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some\nseriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few\noutstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or\nunder-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost\nuniversally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han\nand Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise\ntwist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some\nsigns of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those\nmoments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and\nvalleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and\ninstead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort\nthat's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later,\nit's damn near perfect.\n"},
{"review": "\nAfter having watched A New Hope, I watched the next installment to the\noriginal trilogy before the prequel trilogy \"The Empire Strikes Back\"\nand I personally agree that this is a great follow-up to it's\npredecessor since it defined the meaning of a Hollywood classic.<br><br>The directing from Irvin Kershner is brilliantly focused and adds a\ngreat atmosphere to the movie, making it a lot darker than the previous\nfilm. The story is very original and has a lot of exciting moments and\na touching scene where Leia says, \"I love you\" and Han Solo says, \"I\nknow.\" in the carbonate scene especially the lightsaber fight scenes\nbetween Luke and Darth Vader. In fact, the characters are likable as\nthey were in A New Hope. Mark Hamill did great as Luke as a now\ndetermined warrior to find out about his father from Yoda played\nbrilliantly by Frank Oz along with Alec Guiness as the ghost Obi-Wan.\nCarrie Fisher and Harrison Ford did great with their love and chemistry\nas Princess Leia and Han Solo. The only character who steals the show,\nhowever, goes to Darth Vader thanks to James Earl Jones' dark and\nintimidating voice. The music from John Williams is excellent and gives\nan epic scope to the movie and the pacing moves along quite well. Even\nthe visuals are magnificent.<br><br>Overall, a great follow-up to A New Hope and is always worth watching\njust like that film.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt is not always possible for a sequel to re-capture the peculiar magic\nof an original film. 'The Empire Strikes Back' manages to do so by\nbeing less of a sequel than it is a new film on its own. The story\nbegun in 'Star Wars' is advanced, the characters &amp; their relationships\nwith one another are deepened and the film itself abandons much of the\neasy spirit of the first film in favour of a darker and more uncertain\ntone. If the first film was largely about heroism, the second is\nlargely concerned with struggle. The main characters are soundly tested\nin this film and for the most part, they come up short.<br><br>This is also the film that transforms Darth Vader into one of the\nscreen's great villains. Vader was interesting in 'Star Wars,' but he\nis iconic in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and he rightfully takes his\nplace as not only a great villain, but a great character. In spite of\nthe despair that runs through the film, the visuals and imagination so\napparent in 'Star Wars' returns here, as well. The film is littered\nwith awesome action sequences and more than enough 'coolness' to\nmeasure up to its predecessor.<br><br>Again, the original (1980) version is the one to see - if given the\noption - although the enhancements made to this film are somewhat less\ninvasive than those applied to 'Star Wars.' Still, the film is more\ncharming and more polished its original release. It is considerably\nless delightful than its predecessor, but it is every bit as good of a\nfilm, if not even slightly superior to 'Star Wars.'\n"},

And let's just say that\nI\nhadn't seen it in years just before I voted. And a 10 sounded so, well,\nunreal, especially when you should actually presume that it's the original\nStar Wars which deserves a 10. If one of the movies should have one. But\nit\nwas this one I found right. I still do. I am sure that this is the\nabsolutely greatest adventure movie of all time. Of all Star Wars movies.\nOf\nthe Indiana Jones movies. And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every\nadventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will\nprobably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this\none. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry\nthere is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there\nare many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's\namazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke.\nThe truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference.\nThe\nintroduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great\nImperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just\nabout\neverything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so\nclimatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely\nfinest film in the entire Star Wars series.

{"review": "\n\nFor me, The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best films I have seen. It\nis\nthe best of the five Star Wars films, though perhaps that is down to\ndirector Irvin Kershner who tweaked George Lucas's original vision into\nsomething darker than the original and infinitely bleaker than the\nfollow-up\nReturn of the Jedi.

In\n'A\nNew Hope' we are introduced to a near-merciless killer  and his evil\nnature\nseems to have grown by the time of 'Empire'. One by one, incompetent\nunderlings make their way to the Super Star Destroyer morgue as the Sith\nLord searches for his prize. It isn't until 'Jedi' that we feel Vader to\nbe\nhuman at all, despite the famous cliffhanger end to this film.<br><br>It's hard to define what this film means to me, other than alot.

{"review": "\nIn cinema, there are two categories: movies and films. Movies are the\nmainstream and average ones, such as The Avengers, The Hunger Games,\nand Transformers. Films are ones that transcend and push the envelope,\nin how movies should be made, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, The\nGodfather, and Pulp Fiction. The Empire Strikes Back is a FILM. This is\na film that pushes the limits in how a sequel should be made and sets\nthe bar for movie sequels to come. This improves everything about Star\nWars, such as the story and cast. The story here puts our heroes at\ntheir lowest point. Our heroes are divided and are separated throughout\nmost of the film. Luke Skywalker and R2-D2 are training with Jedi\nMaster Yoda, while Han Solo, Princess Leia, and C-3PO are relentless\npursued across the galaxy by Darth Vadar. The tone during the whole\nfilm is bleak and depressing. You feel bad for the characters for going\nthrough all the bad crap in the film. The cast here get more fleshed\nout. Luke, who was a farmer boy in the last movie, matures, Han Solo\nand Princess Leia develop romantic feelings for one another, and Darth\nVadar becomes more evil and cruel in his actions.The only bad thing\nabout this movie is the Special Edition.

{"review": "\nThis is it my favorite movie of all time, now I'm not saying it's the\nbest, because that honor belongs to The Godfather, this is more my\nopinion than anything else. So why do I like it so much, well nostalgia\nis a key factor, I was 8 when this came out, and it was even better\nthan the first one, the stakes were higher, it was darker, and it had\none of the greatest twists ever (beaten only by The Usual Suspects, and\nThe Sixth Sense). It was just great, like the first one, while adding\ngreat new things to the tables. It is my favorite movie of all time,\nand it is without a doubt a timeless classic.<br><br>it is a 10/10.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is my favorite out of the original Star Wars movies, and for good\nreason. There's action, there's drama, and there's Yoda (because who\ndoesn't love the little green guy?). Not to mention the fact that\nHarrison Ford is in it, and he's a brilliant actor. Mark Hamill does a\ngreat job playing Luke Skywalker, and Carrie Fischer is a convincing\nLeia as well. I'm personally not a fan of Lando, but he's not terrible.\nThe special effects aren't perfect, but it IS an older movie, so it's\nforgivable. Lightsabers: I really wish they were real. Also, it\nshouldn't be a surprise to know, but the stormtroopers still can't hit\nanything. I love all six of the movies, but this one is truly\nspectacular.\n"},
{"review": "\nYou've gotta admire George Lucas' moxie. It was bold enough that he\nsought out to self-finance \"The Empire Strikes Back\", but the movie has\nto be a downer on top of it. Make matters worse, he ends on one\nhumdinger of a cliffhanger that people had to wait 3 years for\nresolution. That's sheer balls. <br><br>But what a terrific movie it is. For one, it surpasses the original,\nwhich is rare in the sequel department. But it also takes its time to\nlet the story unfold, characters get fleshed out, and the whole thing's\na stirring mix of humor, drama and action. <br><br>Yoda's scenes are some of my favorite of the trilogy. Frank Oz was able\nto lend that puppet such a personality that it simply becomes a wizened\nold Jedi master and not a special effect. <br><br>And Darth Vader's presence in this movie makes him one of the all0time\ngreat movie villains. He's unhinged, choking out underlings left and\nright, and pursuing Luke with reckless abandon. Badass seems kind of\ntrite, but it fits here. <br><br>\"The Empires Strikes Back\" is a movie that just fires on every last\ncylinder. Great dialogue, suspense, set pieces and production values.\nFor my money, it's John Williams' finest score, and the movie continues\nto be one of my absolute favorites (not to mention the best of the\ntrilogy). <br><br>10/10\n"},
{"review": "\nEmpire Strikes Back is said to be the best Star Wars film and many\nwould be correct. For me it isn't but it doesn't mean I don't love it.\nThis film starts off in Planet Hoth, the Ice planet where I wish I\ncould live. This film I think I have only seen twice, and both times I\nseemingly enjoyed it. For a film made in 1980, a not so famous year\nthis film is Excellent. Many fans of A New Hope came to see this and\nwere stunned greatly. The sheer greatness of this film is nothing any\nother film can compete with. Though this isn't about greatness, its\nabout placing out how good it really is. I'd rate it a 8.3 probably\nbecause 8.8 is a little too much. Attack of the Clones is better for\nme, and I know you readers might not like that but hey! We all gotta\nhave an opinion.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe fifth installment to one of the greatest film franchises on the\nplanet. Not only just an all around great movie but home to one of the\ngreatest moments in film history when Darth Vader, after battling Luke,\ninforms him that he is his father. The film has many classic moments\npeople know by heart some who haven't even seen the full saga. It's\namazing how certain moments are known by people worldwide without even\nseeing the full movie. Just another look at George Lucas's brilliance\nin film making. Although he is no longer in the making of the next few\nfilms set to come out over the next few years, after seeing the great\nremakes of star trek i'm confident J.J. Abrams will do a good job in\nkeeping not only the classic feeling there but also adding more to an\nalready fantastic franchise.\n"},
{"review": "\nI think this movie is the best Star Wars movie ever.The story of the\nmovie and character selection is very good.The effects of the movie is\ngood for this years.There are some errors in the film, but they can be\nignored.<br><br>The musics in the movie is great.I think Imperial March is the best\nmovie music.It reflects dark side very well.Also I love the sound of\nlight-saber.<br><br>Need to be tied to violate the laws of physics in order to facilitate\nexpression. Because the planet of the Star Wars like The Arabian Nights\ntale. Lucas doesn't conform to the realities of his own creation\nuniverse, but it is sinking me this moments.<br><br>You absolutely watch this film.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe best Star wars movie ever! Great story, Great acting and Great\naction. Even the music in this film was amazing. Usually when a great\nfilm comes out the sequel sucks. Not in this case. The Empire Strikes\nBack did not follow the crappy sequel line. The reason it might be so\ngood is because George Lucas did not direct it. The only problem I have\nis the ending. Why is Lando Wearing Hans clothes? does Han have a\ncloset full of the same clothes that fit Lando? who knows... The Empire\nStrikes back is a film that you can watch over and over and never get\nbored. I have seen this film over 100 times and I still love watching\nit.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis brilliant film wastes no time telling it's elaborate story. I was\n9 years young when my father took me to see this in the theater. Back\nthen you had to stand in line to see the soonest showing because it\nonly showed once at a time, but boy was it ever worth it. What can\npossibly be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? How\nmany other movies can you think of where the sequel is just as good, if\nnot better, than the first? I can think of only three; The Godfather\nPart II, Terminator 2 and Superman 2. It's hard to believe that this\nfilm wasn't even nominated, considering The Return Of The King was not\nonly nominated but won best picture; different times I guess. At the\ntime there were a few scenes that shocked me; Han's freezing and the\nlook of him, Luke losing half his arm and right after that learning\nthat Vader is his father. Wow! I recall the scene where Luke goes into\nthat tunnel and light sabers Vader's head off to reveal his own face,\nscaring the crap out of me. Another thing that was big back then was\nthe merchandising. Lucas got a ton of money from my parents because of\nthis franchise. I had everything that ever came out from trading cards,\naction figures to even bed sheets. God I wish I had it all still and in\nit's original packaging. And having just watched this, probably for the\n2nd dozenth time, I can tell you that it still holds the test of time.\nSo watch it again, preferably the original version in surround sound at\na good loud level for the 2 hours and 4 minutes of it's running time\nand enjoy and American sci-fi classic.\n"},
{"review": "\nYes! That is it! It was my first VHS movie since 1990''s, I can\nremember that very well! What can I say? It's nothing! It's\nsuper-action science- fiction film for that year and still popular\nthrough many fans and collectors! George Lucas started his saga so many\nyears ago...., but the time is infinite for him! He creates something\ncreative, something brilliant, something wonderful, that I cant explain\nin full words! The saga will be sound again, again and again in our\nears, in our hearts and in our mind forever! I just would like to say\none important thing! To wish THE BEST REGARDS from us to this\n\"favourite master\" of his own \"genre\"!!!!! The SAGA will be with us\nAlways!\n"},
{"review": "\nI, like so many others of my generation, grew up with this movie. I\nremember watching it on a scruffy VHS and being in awe the whole time.\nThere are so many magical moments - how Luke escapes from the lair of\nthe hairy beast, how Han realizes he flew inside a space monster's maw,\nhow Darth Vader suffocates the admirals who keep failing him, how Yoda\nraises the X-Wing from the bog, how Han is frozen in carbonite, and of\ncourse the ending's Big Reveal of cinema history.<br><br>Though I love all the old Star Wars movies, this one really takes the\ncake. It has a perfect balance of whimsical adventure and darker\nmoments (battles, betrayals, even torture). The dialog is really\niconic, featuring the famous Yoda-speech and the quips between Han and\nLeia.<br><br>The remastered edition is absolutely gorgeous. The film is colorful and\nsharp and the special effects look fine, never really distracting you\nfrom the experience. I wish they used more of these practical effects\n(models, animatronics, costumes) nowadays.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt was an incredible movie and probably one of the best in the series.\nI would not mind seeing it again, Star Wars Episode V was one of the\nmost ingenious movies I have ever seen. I can't wait to see any future\nones. George Lucas is a real genius of Sci Fi movies. I wonder what\nmight be in store for the future. We will just need to see. Also Chewie\nis really funny and this is a great film. I wonder what new threat will\narise. Star wars Forever Amen. I also wonder what new planets our\nheroes will visit. I bet the droids will be even funnier. Disney will\nhopefully make Star Wars even better. Also I think Princess Leia will\nbe even more beautiful in the future movies.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie is completely an excellent work of art.I love this movie as\nit has a very close place in my heart.No,I have not seen this movie a\nhundred times just like the person next door,I have only seen this\nbrilliant masterpiece a merely 3 times,I was not born n the 90s and\ndefinitely did not see it when it was first launched as I was born in\n2001.It has only been a half a year since I saw this movie and I was\njust so sad on the fact that I was not born earlier.<br><br>Although the storyline may seem a little bit not as good as the earlier\none (Ep.4 A New Hope) but it lived up to its hype,and then some(believe\nme,that some is a lot.).Extremely brilliant,The Imperial March is my\ncellphone's ring-tone now,although it gets a little weird\nsometimes.Frank Oz as Yoda is amazing.The entire cast is brilliant,this\nis my favorite movie of the entire franchise.<br><br>Now All we can do is re-watch these movies and just wait for the next\nsequel trilogy (containing ep.7,8 and 9.)and see how Star Wars results\nwhen it is put under direction by Disney and passed on to the next\ngeneration(which is supposed to be mine ?) under J.J Abrams.

{"review": "\nThis by far is my favorite movie of all time. Of Course I saw the\noriginal Star Wars when it first came out in theaters in 1977 which\nblew my mind and took me on the adventure of a lifetime. But Empire is\nthe best of the three original films. It's ability to connect the\ncharacters in a more personal way and to reveal how deeply each\ncharacter affects the progression of the story.<br><br>Each scene and sequence moves the viewer closer and closer to a pivotal\npoint where the characters are also paired as an influential unit\nrelevant to a particular plot. Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, Princess\nLea and Han Solo, which interconnect with the other pairs Han Solo/Luke\nSkywalker and Vader/Lea. The flow of dialog from these characters help\ncreate a malleable cohesion as to help support the type of character in\nwhich they each portray; hero, villain, damsel in distress and rouge\nsmuggler.<br><br>Besides all that this space and time adventure brought the audience\ninto the story and helped create a new mythical journey. I have since\nwatched this movie hundreds of times over the years, will always be the\none movie that influence my imagination and will continue to watch it\neven more.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was awesome! <br><br>I loved the characters (Vader was my favourite).<br><br>I loved the story (Including the plot twist with Darth Vader the father\nof Luke Skywalker).<br><br>And I loved the visuals (For a 1980 movie, the effects are brilliant).<br><br>And it's kinda funny this movie wasn't directed by George Lucas\n(Instead it's directed by Irvin Kershner while George was the executive\nproducer).<br><br>My favourite scene in this movie would have to be The Battle of Hoth\nbecause the soundtrack, visuals and acting were all spot on.<br><br>Speaking of the soundtrack, John Williams must've had a wonderful time\ncreating the pieces of music in this film.<br><br>I would highly recommend you see this movie (Either on TV or a DVD),\nyou'll have a wonderful time.\n"},
{"review": "\nEpisode V is the finest entry of the first two trilogies, since it is\nthe best written(really strong dialogue, situations, and realistic\nevolution of the returning characters) phenomenal direction by Irvin\nKirshner(exciting and breathless, always something going on of\ninterest) and equally spectacular F/X, which still hold up(did not need\nmuch tweaking for the Special Editions) Story has the Empire striking\nback(of course!) against the rebellion(despite the loss of the Death\nStar) and our heroes' attempts to survive and enact their next plan of\nattack, only to become captured by an unwitting betrayal of old friend\nLando(Billy Dee Williams, quite smooth but appealing).

{"review": "\nI remember going to the movie theater to watch the premiere of Star\nWars... This experience totally blew my mind!!! I had never experienced\nanything quite as powerful before. I felt like similar adventures may\nactually be happening in other galaxies, far, far away and we think we\nare alone on our little planet... I obviously ran to the theater one\nmore time as soon as The Empire Strikes Back hit the silver screen.\nThen that was it. From the first images, I was like in command of a\nSnowspeeder! This visuals were simply mesmerizing, should I say\nStriking! From this day, I knew I wanted to be part of something like\nthat... one day. I am not there yet, but I am now a CG artist, working\nvery hard at perfecting my art, looking at every detail that can make\neach of my model more realistic, more believable. I am also writing and\nproducing a sci-fi movie: Apostone 'resurrection'. A mix of CG\nanimation and acting. I am realizing my dream since I met Star Wars the\nsandman.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is so amazing for so many reasons but the one thing I have\nto say is the greatest is that the bad guys are winning the entire\ntime.

However once he had established\nthe rebellion and set up the characters he was free to do some good guy\nbashing.<br><br>You know who the good guys and bad guys are, you know how these types\nof stories typically end (with the good guys winning) so you know that\nno matter what happens in the middle movie, it has to end well. With\nthat in mind, why not make the rebels lose, cut off Luke's hand, and\nfreeze Han in carbonite. It keeps the watching at the edge of his seat\nwanting to know whats going to happen.\n"},
