{"review": "\nLet me start by saying that \"American Sniper\" has portrayed the true\nface of Americas great brainwashing weapon called \"Hollywood\".<br><br>As in the movie \"Inglourious Basterds\" where Dr Goebbels, Reich\nMinister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, has been\ngiven a right to direct a movie for Fuhrer himself, a national pride\nperformance which depicts a war hero, German Sniper killing 300\n\"enemies\" in three days. Now switch the roles with Clint Eastwood as a\ndirector, Fuhrer as a Americas high elite of nowadays, and Nazi Sniper\nas an American Sniper Chris Kyle.<br><br>A big irony this movie is, and as such it shows how much effort will\nAmerican Movie Industry give in order to brainwash its own people.<br><br>Pathetic.\n"},
{"review": "\nit was extremely 'even'. nothing seemed overplayed. well balanced\nstorytelling. as someone else wrote, best war movie i've seen in\nyears...and while we're at it, best clint movie in a few outings, as\nwell... i agree that the ending is a bit sudden. but there was no\nreason to drag it out, either... i don't feel it lingered on any one\ndynamic of what would be expected from a film like this...not TOO much\nviolence or proselytizing/flag waving or lingering on casualty\nhorrors... it doesn't, on the other hand, turn away from any of the\nugliness, either... i thought bradley cooper did a great job in the\nrole. the changes he gradually instilled into the character were subtle\nbut present. it's as well done a war movie as i'll ever need.\n"},
{"review": "\nI can't remember a movie in the last decade, that was as riveting and\ncaptivating as \"American Sniper.\" I kept seeing the trailer on TV and\nwhen I finally went to see it, I was already jacked-up...and it\ndelivered.<br><br>A+ Script A+ Director A+ Lead Actor A+ Supporting Actors A+\nCinematographer<br><br>I don't give a flying crap about anybody's politics when it comes to\nmaking movies.

{"review": "\nThe movies is about Chris Kyle's home life and military career with the\nUS Navy as a SEAL sniper. The movie has some intense moments,\ncontaining violent and disturbing scenes. The movie doesn't portray\nChris as a Rambo figure but rather a man that deals with the problems\nall soldiers have to face both overseas and at home. Clint Eastwood who\nis in his mid-eighties, shows us he still has it, directing an amazing\nfilm. The movie tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the first\nbook. Overall, American Sniper is a great movie that has all the\ncomponents, that make a movie great. For anyone who is a war film\nenthusiast, this is a movie for you. To those who call Chris Kyle a\nmurderer and baby killer, I believe you fail to understand what\nsoldiers sacrifice to protect our liberties and keep us free.\n"},
{"review": "\nGood work on Bradley Cooper's part as well, putting on the weight and\ngetting into character to play Chris Kyle, a sniper for the navy seals\nwho did four tours in Iraq protecting his fellow troops by being a\nlegendary shot. the Movie explores Kyle having to deal with a rival\nsniper who was keeping him from doing the job of protecting his troops\nand having to deal with coming home to his wife and kids feeling that\nhis mission was incomplete. <br><br>Old man Eastwood mixed action, drama and humor in a way only a\nlegendary filmmaker could put together. The man still has the ability\nto tell a compelling story.<br><br>Bradley Cooper showed a range that is more Oscar worthy than what he\ndid in Silver Linings Playbook. <br><br>It was nothing but enjoyable from beginning to end. Worth watching.\n"},
{"review": "\nAmerican sniper is probably one of the best war films I've seen since\nSaving Private Ryan. Now I would probably won't consider this a war\nfilm because it mostly focuses on one character. One of the most recent\nwar films that I really enjoyed last year was Lone Survivor. Now I\nthought that movie was really good but it was just handle very overly\ndramatic. I think this is probably one of the best performances Bradley\nCooper has given in his career. I also think this is Clint Eastwood's\nbest movie he has directed since Gran Torino. The action scenes were\nhandled very well and it felt real. One problem I had with the film\nwere the supporting characters. Now the acting for them were good but\nit's just you never get to know most of them their just there for the\nmain character. The story is mostly just learning about one character.\nThere really isn't that much to say about this film but if your a fan\nof war films then I would highly recommend checking this film out.\n"},
{"review": "\nI honestly believe every American should see this film. If after\nviewing you aren't filled with a sober reverence and feelings of\ngratitude then shame on you. This is the quintessential film\nsurrounding the war on terror from the point of view of those that\nserved and even their families. I've read a review by a former Navy\nSeal (Brent Gleeson) that says it best\u0085 \"The way the film was directed\ncoupled with outstanding performances by Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller\nand the rest of the cast made for a heart wrenching and deeply accurate\nportrayal of the external and internal battles our service men and\nwomen face. Not to mention the even greater sacrifices made by the\nfamilies and loved ones back home.\" <br><br>I would rate it shear perfection had they spent more time with his\nrecovery and angst driven road back once he was stateside.

{"review": "\nAmerican Sniper is an intricate piece of modern history told through\nthe eyes of someone that lived it. Clint Eastwood successfully portrays\nthe life of the most decorated sniper in American history while also\ndelineating the mental strain caused by war. While highlighting Chris\nKyle's success as a dominant force in the navy seals, Eastwood also\ndelves into the more sensitive and intimate parts of Chris Kyle's life,\nsuch as his marriage, his children and most significantly the mental\nanxiety which is derived from war. The cinematography and sound effects\nare simply superb and add great depth to the film, especially the war\nscenes. Bradley Cooper adds a gleaming presence to this film and one\nwould consider it to be the defining role of his career. Cooper's\ndedication to the role along with excellent screen writing has cemented\nthis movie as one of the greats.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had high hopes for this movie and was not disappointed, Bradley\nCooper delivers what I think is his best performance thus far. It kicks\nyou in the face and takes you along for the ride. I also commend the\nattention to detail in every aspect of this film, you could almost\ntaste the Iraqi dust in your mouth. The story follows an American\nsoldier from his home in Texas to the battlefields in Iraq, true\ncamaraderie that I haven't seen in a long time. The portrayal of\n\"p.t.s.d.\" and how it affects our soldiers was heartfelt and real. If\nyou haven't seen a good war movie since \"Saving Pvt. Private Ryan\",\nthis one's for you. Congrats Mr. Eastwood, I smell a room full of\nstatues for this one.\n"},

Before too long and\nwe are back to the the nerve testing life of a sniper.<br><br>If you thought Clint Eastwood music scores were meager previously with\nthree notes, here there are no notes. Some of the most effective scenes\nare those when Cooper is on the phone with his wife at home.<br><br>It's a tough movie about a guy doing a tough job. Most of the time he\nis providing cover for soldiers on the ground. Kyle was a legend and\nhero to those ground units.

{"review": "\nThis movie was very good at depicting how soldiers feel and I don't\nthink it could have been better at explaining it because it was so well\nat showing it. Bradley Cooper did an amazing job acting in this film\nand the graphics were considerably good knowing it couldn't have\npossibly been filmed in real time war setting. I especially liked how\nthey referred to veterans and disabled vets trying to deal with being\nback from tour. Being a veteran myself I know what it's like to want to\nfight for our country and it was a great job showing that in the\nsoldiers that were in the film. It was sad to see the soldiers die but\nthere wouldn't be truth to the film if it didn't show soldiers die and\nkids and women trying to kill our soldiers.

{"review": "\nThis is a contribution to counter the negative reviews posted. Many\nshow the lack of class and respect the public can reveal in time of\nanother's loss. (Also, review for duplicates?) At the end of the movie,\nI sat amongst an audience who loudly clapped in support of the movie\nand the hero it represented and heard shouts of things like \"God bless\nhim.\" I am sure this was a common event throughout many American\ntheaters understanding, admiring and agreeing with the value of\nservice, loyalty, bravery and selflessness.

I was glad to see last year\nthat they were going to being making a movie and didn't exactly know\nwhat I'd think of it but it was great very heart warming and just shows\nwhat kind of ordeals are troops face over there.

{"review": "\nAs a movie, outstanding! As for Mr. Kyle, he is an American Hero. His\ncountry sent him to do a job, and he did it.

{"review": "\nAmerican Sniper is one of those films that takes you on a journey\nthrough the eyes of a true hero. First off, Bradly Cooper played an\namazing role, definitely the best of his career. He bulked up in muscle\nand just let the role consume him. The overall story was interesting\nand had a good pace. The directing and cinematography were really done\nwell, the movie looked great and it really drew you in from the\nbeginning. The one thing that I did not like about it was that it\ndidn't tear me apart emotionally like I wanted it to.

{"review": "\nThis is one of the best movies I've ever seen. This is Clint Eastwood's\nbest, and most powerful film that he has directed. My second favourite\nperformance by Bradley Cooper (next to Guardians of the galaxy) <br><br>A great screenplay by Jason Hall, adapted from the amazing biography of\nChris Kyle. This is a Great film that can compare to other Great War\nfilms such as Apocalypse now, Patton, The dirty dozen, etc. The film is\nvery realistic, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire\ntime.

It's refreshing as water in\nthe desert, to see a movie with the quality so rare in Hollywood these\ndays: moral conviction.<br><br>This film speaks the truth at several levels, but the one thing that\nwill stay with me forever, is that this is the first major motion\npicture I have ever seen to show someone, the hero no less, doing heavy\ndeadlifts.

{"review": "\nLike The Hurt Locker, American Sniper provides insight into how war\nimpacts the psyche of soldiers. Although Navy SEAL Chris Kyle is\ncelebrated among fellow soldiers, director Clint Eastwood lends as much\ntime portraying the strain the war had on Kyle's personal life,\nspecifically his wife. Bradley Cooper (who trained for three months to\ngain 40 pounds of muscle) plays the conflicted Kyle, who forces himself\nto develop a hatred of the enemy, referring to Iraqis as \"savages,\" so\nhe can justify killing them. The action scenes provide an adrenaline\nrush, but it's the intentional moments of silence \u0097 such as when Kyle,\nwith finger on the trigger, is deciding whether to kill a child who is\nholding what appears to be a bomb \u0097 that make American Sniper an\noutstanding movie.\n"},

Chris Kyle embodied all that\nis best about America: courage, honor, commitment to duty, love of\nfamily. It is little wonder that this film is smashing box office\nrecords not only here but around the world. The tone is just about\nperfect, throughout the movie. This is due to Clint Eastwood's\nexcellent directing. It is quite refreshing that a real American hero -\nnot one of Hollywood's phony PC cutouts - and his time serving his\ncountry and struggles and triumphs at home are the subject of an epic\nsuch as this one.

An unsuspecting Texan has saved the\nday, which is the truth, this time.

Using slow motion during fight\nscenes and sniper shots would have been a Hollywood treatment of this\nbiography.

If i saw someone\nwalking towards one of our convoys with a bomb strapped to them, I'd\nshoot their ass too. The Iraq war wasn't about oil or WMDs. It was\nabout genocide and the thousands of innocent people that were murdered\nby Saddam Hussein. Not to mention it was a safe haven for terrorists.\nThe majority of Iraqis killed deserved to die.

{"review": "\nAmerican Sniper is based on an autobiography by Chris Kyle, written\nwith Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice. It's the story of the life and\ntimes of Kyle, who had four tours in Iraq, totaling circa 1,000 days,\nresulting in more than 160 kills credited to him as a sniper. The film\nis about his experiences and the costs - emotional and psychological -\nthey had on him. It's about how punishing the American Dream can be.\nThe idea to make the film with these themes was brought to Eastwood by\nan actor to whom this was a personal project about which he was\npassionate. This deliberate humanizing of the soldier at the center of\nthe story into a tenderhearted family man is what sets American Sniper\napart from other recent war flicks like Lone Survivor and The Hurt\nLocker.

{"review": "\nBradley Cooper stars as Chris Kyle, the most prolific sniper in\nAmerican military history. It begins with the thirty year old Kyle as a\ncowboy type who is searching for meaning in his life when he becomes a\nnavy seal. After rigorous training he is sent to Iraq and becomes a\nlegendary sniper. The war scenes look very similar to Stanley Kubrick's\noften used ones in Full Metal Jacket. The camera tracks from behind the\nsoldiers as they move forward. The action is fast paced and well done\nby director Clint Eastwood. The melodramatic family moments are fairly\ntypical, with the suffering wife holding the home front while hubby\nkeeps the world safe for democracy. I found Sierra Miller annoying as\nKyle's spouse, but Cooper was cast right in the lead role. Although a\nbit too long at two hours and fifteen minutes, it is still one of the\nbetter films of 2014.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have watched this movie over five times already and have found myself\nin awe, happiness, relief, thankfulness, and in tears by the end of\nthis amazing movie. Every American should see this movie to see a\nlittle of what our soldiers have to go through. By all means, this\nmovie does not serve our troops justice because I can't even imagine.\nThey are the bravest men God has put on his beautiful Earth so protect\nus from evil. This movie makes you realize how important our soldiers\nare. My thoughts and prayers are with Chris Kyle's friends and family.\nBy far, one of my favorite movies. Chris Kyle's story was finally told\nafter the fact he was gone. This movie shows that Chris Kyle was more\nthan just a Navy Seal with a rifle, he was on mission to protect his\nbrothers that were there with him. Chris Kyle saves many, many people\nincluding soldiers despite the danger he was in and having to leave his\nfamily at home. He is a true hero.\n"},
{"review": "\nAmerican Sniper did a great job portraying an Chris Kyle as the\nAmerican hero he is. It showed how he did what he had to do while\nfighting in the war but also did whatever he could do to help others\nafter he came back home and helped himself. The fighting scenes in this\nfilm may not be exactly what had happened but it is very intense and\nappeals to the people who have never experienced it. It is very real to\nthese people and helps you realize what Chris Kyle went through. After\nall he goes through in the war it destroys the person he was but does\nnot kill him. him or end up killing him. After his war experiences hurt\nhim, he helps himself and gets back to who he used to be. After all the\nfighting he is killed why fighting others.\n"},
{"review": "\nI thought this movie was powerful. It portrayed the military man he\nwas, how he had to adapt to civilian life again, the struggles of war.\nFor him to then be killed by a man he was trying to help, who was also\ndealing with post war mental health. It shows the strains and stresses\nof what war is really like. I believe this movie to be excellent and\nmoving. Sad ending for such a great Soldier. Reading some of the\nreviews, surprise me. I wonder how these guys would cope 1. Just with\nwar in general. 2. Being a sniper which you have to battle with your\nmind playing tricks, being 100% alert the whole time, whilst laying in\nyour urine and poo. My hat is off to the man and it's so sad he died.\nRip American sniper.\n"},
{"review": "\nHow can people be so brainwashed by this movie? Just another clich\u00e9'\npro-American war propaganda film, end of story! This film is Nothing\nnew, doesn't bring anything to the table...The plot is obvious, every\nscene is Predictable, we've all seen this script a million\ntimes...beaten and sold to the Highest bidder, pushed by the Hollywood\nwar machine. The main character is \"always\" a lone wolf, just killing\neveryone in sight, totally unstoppable! He has a southern accent, and\njust the right amount of Scruff on his beard! How original, Not! I\ncouldn't even Finish this movie, what a joke! I almost Never give bad\nreviews on here, but this was just crap, talk about beating the dead\nhorse!\n"},
{"review": "\nA different movie than I thought. Less a movie about the joys of war\nand more about the psychology effect of war on people. I can tell that\nmany people who wrote about this move did not actually see the movie.\nThose that talk about it being propaganda have never seen or did not\nstay to watch it. This movie did not say war is good was nothing good.\nOnly the attitude that a man went to war to protect Americans and with\nthis ideal, he went on to be great. It took a longer time for him to be\naffected by the evils of war, but in the end, the evils of war,\neventually caught up with him and he had to quit, even if he didn't\nwant to quit. I don't understand the hate I hear about it, except that\nsome are predisposed to a certain opinion and can't look at this film\nobjectively.\n"},
{"review": "\nEver since I read the book I had high expectations for the film. That\nbeing said, the film went above and beyond what I was expecting. I was\ncompletely blown away. Bradley Cooper truly delivered on his finest\nrole ever (in my opinion at least), and Clint Eastwood's directing was\noutstanding. The film made it seem like I was on the battlefield with\nChief Chris Kyle (even though I'm not in the service) and looked death\nin the eye like he did. But it also reminds me of those who do\nserve/have served, and my appreciation for what they do to protect our\ncountry has gone up so many levels. In closing, American Sniper is a\nmust-watch film, and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. To\nall those who serve/have served our country: thank you for your\nservice, and God bless America!!\n"},
{"review": "\nI consider myself an independent though I usually vote Demoratic. With\nthat in mind, I viewed this movie with an open mind concerning the\ncharacter of Chris Kyle and his motivations for fighting in the Middle\nEast as well as how he coped with his post-war life and home life\nconcerning his wife and his children. Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller\ndo fine in their roles as first single people getting to know each\nother before they get married and he then goes to a far away country\nprotecting people in a foreign land from committing terrors against\nother peoples. Clint Eastwood compellingly depicts the hardships\ninvolved in doing the job and making it back not only in one piece but\nalso with some lasting issues in trying to get back to a normal life\nafter all that calamity. So on that note, I recommend American Sniper.\n"},
{"review": "\n.....when Jane Fonda praises a Clint Eastwood war movie.<br><br>I mean you expect people like Mikey Moore to trash this genre, but when\nJane Fonda says nice things about what is considered to be a movie with\na right-leaning theme, you have to know it's probably worth seeing.\nPerhaps there's hope for Jane after all these years. It's telling that\nthe most vocal detractors (Moore, et al) are also those least likely to\nhave ever worn a uniform (well, a REAL uniform, not the moth-eaten\nball-cap, Joe Sixpack uniform that Moore like to wear). Fonda compares\nthe film to \"Coming Home\", which I was not crazy about, but I grant\nthat it was a good film.\n"},

{"review": "\nWar doesn't come lightly, it takes lives, destroys homes, and brings\nnations to its knees. Chris was a cowboy turned seal, after examining\nthe movie you can see that this plays a big part in him having drive to\nbe able to make it through the war. As the movie goes on there is a\ntime when Chris is sitting at home staring at a blank T.V. Some\ndramatic music is playing building tension. Yet the key point is we\nstart to hear screams, and gunshots, they start to get louder and\nlouder until his wife comes and interrupts his thoughts. This displays\nChris's PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) very well, and is one of\nhis encounters with it.\n"},
{"review": "\nLet's face it, this is should not have been a Best Picture nominee. But\nis the movie complete garbage? Absolutely not. Bradley Cooper has an\nincredible performance as Chris Kyle as well as Sienna Miller. Clint\nEastwood's direction also makes you feel like you're dead smack in the\nmiddle of this war. The problem with the film lies in the\nscriptwriting. It's flimsy and didn't really know what it was doing.\nThe directing was unable to match with the screen writing. Eastwood's\nrealistic directing and the unrealistic dialogue clash into this weird\nmesh of a film. However, it is definitely worth seeing for the sake of\nCooper, Miller, and Eastwood.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a great movie. The complaints that it stereotypes Muslims and\npresents them as one dimensional are in themselves stereotypes. The\nWest is at war with Islam but such is the political correctness within\nthe West that the West cannot even define Islam as the enemy. This\nmovie captures perfectly the lacuna between the values of Islam and the\nWest: there is no compromise or overlap in values. Islam makes this\nplain time after time. Chris Kyle is one small cog in this battle and\nhe personifies what it will take to defeat Islam. The sacrifices he\nmakes in respect of his personal life do have a element of clich\u00e9 about\nthem but this lack is more than compensated for by the verisimilitude\nof the battle scenes. Further poignancy to the movie is that Kyle's\nmurderer was at the very least sympathetic to Islam even though there\nis no evidence that he had converted.\n"},
{"review": "\ni really enjoyed this movie it was without a doubt Bradly best films\nand performance of a lifetime more like lone survivor but this one with\nfamily as extra hold, i really enjoyed it i had doubt first that it\nwill be boring but man oh man! one of my best movies of this year.\nalthough i wish there was like more drama or extreme to submit the\nlines and the role of his own although his brother we didn't know what\nhappen to him since that plane scene pf was gone. and i missed seeing\nhis old buds and loved how he react with his kids and especially wife\nat last minutes of the movie and struggling to bring back the old him\nback we should see that like come on Cooper in drama with his feelings\nfans gotta see that. but nonetheless i really enjoyed it hope there's\nmore of such amazing war movies like this one and Lone\nSurvivor.Thnks!!!\n"},

{"review": "\nAs a veteran myself i think there is probably no other man in history\nwill ever be more decorated in war as a sniper than Chris Kyle. this\nmovie is not only motivating but it's also an i opener for what his\nlife was like and what you see through the eyes of the scope. If you\nhave read the book you know exactly what i'm talking about. I think the\nsad part is that all some people will see is a movie that they feel is\nmade solely to make money and tell a story of a true warrior who\nsurvived multiple engagements and then was unfortinatley killed in a\nterrible shooting at a gun range. this movie portrays the life of an\nAmerican hero and someone who loved his family i truly commend clint\neastwood for taking this movie into realm and making it an instant war\nclassic and helping chris kyles legacy live on in our memory\n"},
{"review": "\nFinally watched American Sniper. Now I understand the backlash against\nthis film. While it's very competently filmed and acted, it completely\nwhitewashes the main character, who was, essentially, a mass murderer.\nThere is no nuance in the script or portrayal of Chris Kyle, apparently\na man without any gray areas. And it overlooks the obvious irony, that\nhe was, in turn, killed by another gun toting mass murderer. Then\nthere's the issue of whether bringing a psychotic to a gun range for\n\"rehab\" is such a good idea. Clearly not. And it ignores the fact, as\nmost of the media has, that someone else was killed that day besides\nKyle.<br><br>In all, the film will make you root for the \"good guys\" without raising\nany questions about whether they are all that good. It completely\nmisses a great opportunity to delve deep into the issues of soldiering,\nmental health, gun culture and PTSD. I expect more from a great\nfilmmaker like Eastwood.\n"},
{"review": "\na real person. The movie is about Chris Kyle, a guy whom was a navy\nseal and had the highest total of sniper kills in the middle east. It\nfollows him through a few tours and what his life was like when he came\nhome. He was married and had a couple of kids, but was more concerned\nabout America. When he finally gets out, it shows how his mind was\nstill messed up from what he had experienced but was trying to get\nbetter when he died.<br><br>The best part of the movie was the war scenes that were shot very well.\nYou get a feeling of what it would be like to be a sniper sitting on\ntop of a building. Soon, that's not enough for Chris and he wants to be\ninvolved in the more dangerous door to door. Also toward the end there\nis an exciting shooting scene where Chris completes the main objective\nbut the group's position is compromised and they must get out with a\nhuge sand storm moving in.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: Definitely one of the better films in the past several\nyears. Check it out.\n"},
{"review": "\nYes it is. But we're talking about Clint Eastwood here. And while he\ndid talk to a chair (something I actually thought was funny as an\n\"act\", not so much what he was saying), he's still a good director\nwho's able to juggle things around. And make them feel right - or as\nright as it is possible.<br><br>Many have and will call Snipers cowards. People who are not going into\nactual fight that is going on, but wait and have to kill a lot of\npeople from long distance. But we do get a glimpse into what might be\ngoing on in the head of one of those men. Bradley Cooper is once again\nmesmerizing in his portrayal. And while I was not aware of all real\nlife incidents that happened, that might have elevated the whole story\nfor me.\n"},
{"review": "\nAmerican Sniper is a must-see for those who are craving for the\npowerful war movies. Clint Eastwood's six academy nominated film is\nworth watching overall. Bradley Cooper's portrayal as America's most\nlethal sniper is undoubtedly his best performance yet. His dedication\nof changing his physique and getting the vocal similar to Chris Kyle is\nsimply impressive. He totally deserves this year's Oscar nomination.\nThe story telling is quite compelling, yet it occasionally fills with\nunnecessary political propaganda in the life story of the \"Legend\". All\ntechnologies in making of this film will make everything seemed so\nrealistic which will make you feel with the Iraq war experiences as if\nit is happening just right in front of you. Overall, \"American Sniper\"\nis definitely not a feel good movie as it has some tragic events which\nare currently happening in this world. Combining with the brilliant\nsound effects of intense shootings and realistic cinematic shots will\nmake you to be on the edge of your seat during the entire running time.\n"}
