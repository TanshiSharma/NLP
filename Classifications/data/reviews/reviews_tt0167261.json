{"review": "\nPeter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings:\nThe Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd\npart of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit\nwonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two\nTowers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and\nsometimes even surpasses it.<br><br>This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that?\nWell this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of\nHelms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring.\nBut the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so\ncreepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A\npowerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been\nnominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br><br>The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the\nending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking,\nand as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to\ndefeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down\nIsengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that\nyou truly have to see to believe.<br><br>In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word \"epic\"\nand he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this\nmovie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to\neveryone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly\nunderstand what's going on.<br><br>10/10\n"},
{"review": "\n\nSeriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of\nthe Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This\nmovie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who\nare not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.<br><br>Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and\nIV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed,\nthe beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the\nRing on the big screen.<br><br>Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark\nmovie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor\nguy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse\ncharacter I've ever seen.<br><br>Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as\ndid Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie,\ncaptivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and\nOrlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together,\nprospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn,\nGimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda\nOtto. <br><br>The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for\nitself.<br><br>Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the\nbook, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.<br><br>The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok.\nClosure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the\nKing.<br><br>The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time.<br><br>The scale is broken. 10 is not a capacity sufficient enough to hold this\nmovie... my movie... my... precious...\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nReally, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all,\non\nsomething of a \"post-viewing\" high right now. However, at this moment, my\nfeeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie\nexperience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't\ngathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean\nthat, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their\ntracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson\nhas a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever\nhad.<br><br>The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring \"actors\" not \"stars\";\n\"Oscar-worthy\" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the\nfilm's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John\nRhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy\nSerkis,\nwho was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly\nwell-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).<br><br>For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the\nslight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself\nrealized\nthat visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on\nhis work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also\na\nfew tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final\ncut,\nhowever, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of\nthose.<br><br>In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie\nof\nLotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a\nminute.<br><br>Highly recommended, 10/10.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nYes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the\nculmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but\nhistory will in fact adjudge \"The Two Towers\" as the greatest of the three\nRings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then\nTwo Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter\nJackson said he based it on \"Zulu\"- and we can see why. It has a dramatic\nintensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against\nevil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT\nalso has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best\ndialogue.<br><br>The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what\nwe are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against\nthose who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are\n\"some things worth fighting for\", when Merry tells Pippin that there \"won't\nbe a Shire\" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments\nthat \"the sun has gone down in the West\" this film could be entitled not the\n\"Two Towers\" but \"the Twin Towers\". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is\ncinema as art.<br><br>Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves\nweren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little\nundeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is\nbetter than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as\nFellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a\nlandmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of\nwhat we are all here for\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nEvery great adventure story worth telling has a solid hero - someone who\nputs others before themselves and uses their talents to do their best at\nkeeping the forces of evil at bay even if it means the loss of life and\nlimb. At its core, this movie has eight such heroes and each one lives up to\nthe call. From Pippin and Merry, the lost hobbits who aid the Ents in\nbattle, to Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas who held back the hordes at\nHelms Deep to Frodo and Samwise who continue to make their dangerous and\narduous trek to Mount Doom. All of these characters are heroes and they're\nplayed with love, respect and meaning.<br><br>Though the acting in this film was top notch throughout, I found myself\namazed by Gollum's (motion captured body and voice by Andy Serkis) overall\nperformance. Though obviously CGI, there was so much emotion in this\ncharacter that I couldn't help believe he was real! Though \"Final Fantasy\"\nwas the only movie that created the most realistic CGI characters that\ndominated an entire film, Gollum is lightyears ahead with the simple fact\nthat this deformed li'l hobbit seemed human. He had the spark of life behind\nthose eyes that the FF \"cast\" lacked.<br><br>As a film, this movie has it all - action, drama, comedy - but none of it\nwould've worked without characters we cared about, villains we despised and\nheroes we cheered for. With the obvious success of the first two\ninstallments, the release of the final film next December may prove this to\nbe THE BEST trilogy ever made!\n\n"},
{"review": "\nFrom the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is\ninteresting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's\nattention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense\nthe pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly\npowerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something\nthe first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two\ngreat islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be\ndescribed. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The\nthird movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act\nof coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed\nthrough before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the\nwritten trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream\naudience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they\nwere enjoyable and well made.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies\never. This one is better!<br><br>The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This\nepisode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of\nevents, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the\nnazg\u00fbls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum,\nexcellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him\nfrom the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His\nschizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the\nmovie.<br><br>The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side\ncreatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt,\nwhile the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I\nenjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing\nI partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.<br><br>I rate the movie 9/10 (my highest so far).\n\n"},
{"review": "\nFor this movie, Peter Jackson was faced with a challenge: how to make a\ngreat stand-alone film when the beginning and ending are in separate\nmovies? He did a magnificent job. Like the first one, this movie starts\nwith a slam-bang battle; however, where the first film had armies, this\nfilm has a clash between two titans.<br><br>From there, the movie builds to the enormous set-piece siege. And,\nalong the way, we meet one of the most interesting characters of this,\nor any movie: Gollum, the complex, torn, schitzophrenic slave to the\nwill of the One Ring.<br><br>And, even more than the first film, the Ring is also a character: the\nviewer can see it wearing down Frodo, pushing him to the limit,\ntempting those around him. The encounter at Osgiliath, while not in the\nbook, is a fascinating visual realization of more subtle themes in the\nbook. I know that, when I walked out of the theatre, I knew that there\nwas only one movie I was looking forward to during the next year, and\nthat was Return of the King.\n"},
{"review": "\nI didn't really appreciate this second installment of the LOTR trilogy\nuntil I watched this for the second time. The key was how I looked at\nthe key character of this film: \"Gollum\" (Andy Serkis.). Once I began\nto appreciate and marvel at this weasel-like character, my opinion of\nthe film went from bad to good. That doesn't mean I like that slimy\ncreature: I don't, but I am more fascinated by him rather than totally\nannoyed as I was with the first viewing. A big reason was that I put on\nthe English subtitles, so I was able to understand everything he said.\nI recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his\ndialog. Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic\ncreature was.<br><br>Anyway, this second installment, as in the first, offers a lot of\nfascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action\nscenes and wild characters. For younger kids, I am to happy to say\nthere is absolutely nothing, language-wise, that would offend anyone\nbut the violence is heavy and brutal at times.<br><br>This is a solid, highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy.\nIt's epic film-making. No, it may not be equal to the first - The\nFellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is?\n"},
{"review": "\n<br><br>I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well\nmade. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy\nshould receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even\nhad the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and\nthier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does\nevil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action\nas is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you\nsee movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything.

{"review": "\n\nReally, The Two Towers is the weakest of the three novels, and it is only\nnatural that the middle volume would be a bit of a let down.  Jackson does a\nnice job of trying to lift the story - the battle sequence is fantastic -\nbut to my mind the 10 I might have given for this movie went over the cliff\nwith Aragorn.  I have nothing against Jackson deviating from the books - I\nwas not troubled by the changes in the Faramir character, for instance, and\nadding the Warg riders themselves was a nice touch.  But what was the\npurpose of sending Aragorn over the cliff?  Creating false tension that\nprobably fooled less than 1% of the audience?  Screen time for Liv Tyler? \nAll it did for me was make the movie feel false for about ten minutes.  This\ncrucial mistake is compunded now that we have the Extended Edition and see\nsome of the scenes that were left out of the theatrical release.  the movie\nwould have been stronger without Aragorn's fall, and with, for instance, the\nscene between Boromir and Faramir, or the march of the trees to the Battle\nof Helms Deep.<br><br>Well, so be it.  One or two major missteps in a ten hour movie is not\nunexpected.  On its merits, apart from that, this movie, like the whole\ntrilogy, is a magnificent achievement.<br><br>One question: every time I look, Legolas is shooting dozens of arrows.

{"review": "\n\nLong before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the\nthree Lord of the Rings books to put on film.

Such a waste, he is one of the great\nactors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to\nboot).<br><br>But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk\narmy. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon\nthe trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my\nvoice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive\nnonetheless (and will probably be the model for \"epic battle sequences\" for\nyears to come). And Gollum.

{"review": "\nThis film is one of the best films ever made. This film is almost as\nbreathtaking as the first film but in the end the minor flaws it has\nmakes it worse than the first film. What I consider to be the biggest\nflaw of this film is the character of Gimli. John-Rhys Davies is a\nwonderful actor and I do not blame him for the way the character turned\nout. I blame it on the directing (shame on you Jackson). Being that\nMerry and Pippin are not as much in the second films they were in the\nfirst they could not act as comic relief. Thus the choice was made to\nmake Gimli the comic relief. While the things he says are both funny\nand well timed it becomes to much by the end. A second flaw that pulls\nthe film down a bit is the fact that they deviated too much from the\noriginal book. The Theoden character is very different in the book as\nis Faramir. These flaws were probably necessary to make the film but\nthe hard core Tolkien fans such as myself were disappointed to see\nFaramir drag poor Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath which is only mentioned\nin the book but never seen. This far I have only focused on the bad\nthings in the film but there are very great film historic moments as\nwell. E.g. the battle for Helms Deep is aside from the battle on\nPelleanor Fields the greatest film battle ever conceived on screen. The\nacting in the film is generally on a very high level. Especially Ian\nMcKellen and Viggo Mortensen do very well in the film but also\nJohn-Rhys Davies and Elijah Wood are very good. Aside from the fact\nthat their roles were not as well written as they could have been\nBernard Hill and David Wenham do very well. The effects in the film are\nflawless and on a higher scale than in the first film and the attention\nto detail is overwhelming.

{"review": "\nIf you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess\nwhether or not you should watch this film then please read no further\nand just go and slip in the DVD and let the sights and sounds of Middle\nEarth wash over you.

I guess the audience for\nthe three films fall into two categories; those who have read the books\nand those who have not.

Then there is the \"yes, I have read the books\" class who\nin general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments\nsuch as \"they left out too much\", \"its not what I imagined\" or \"Of\ncourse its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich\". Tolkein\nbemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he\nsought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too\nhumble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic\nbackdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the\nlanguages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed\ndown over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be\ncongratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath\nand its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured\nthe very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve.

It is best appreciated by all the \"Ringheads\" out\nthere who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For\nmy own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have\na different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the\ninstallments. \"<br><br>I've not seen the last installment yet, but my opinion has not changed any.\nFirst off the movie is entirely too long. Not that length itself is bad, but\nin an apparent attempt to follow the books faithfully, much of the story\ndrags badly. Wise producers and directors realize that movies made from\nbooks must exclude much material, to keep the story interesting and the\nrunning time reasonable. People who read novels often do so over weeks.\nMovies are normally watched at one sitting. So, while this long movie may be\njust what the \"Ringheads\" want, for the rest of us it is simply too much of\nthe same, and too long. Still, it has remarkable production values and is a\njoy to watch.  Just too long and boring in spots.\n"},

Here we have a film that's well\ndone in some ways yet in the grand scheme of things it was never\nneeded, the books stand alone and this trilogy of movies are a perhaps\nselfish project? -that are essentially a compromised vision of the\nbooks, this big budget 'action' movie would serve those looking for a\nfeast of CGI effects and action sequences, thankfully there is some\nsubtlety and the interplay between characters is the films saving grace\nand I appreciate the tasteful selection of dialog used for the most\npart. One of my big beefs with The Two Towers and the other 2 movies is\njust how nonthreatening Sauron is in these films, I think this aspect\nweakens the movies a great deal, even the ring wraiths come across as\nimpotent compared to creatures such as the Urak Hai. Another is the\nabrupt transitions between scenes, and the movies lose much of the\n'glue' that the books had tying everything together. Finally 'some' of\nthe CGI effects don't do justice to the imagination - Sauron's eye, and\nthe faces in the dead marsh seem to suffer like Gladrieal did in the\nprevious movie - a little bit too overly dramatic and washed out - I am\nonly mentioning this as a comparison to the majority of effects in this\nmovies which are actually very well done.

{"review": "\nThe Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the\nReturn of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but\nthe most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers.\nAfter 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and\notherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still\nsends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final\nscene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of\na hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the\nheroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill\nwith his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and\ndown with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil\narmy below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the\ncamera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out\na wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I\nam swept away like I've never been before.<br><br>This is cinema at its very best.\n"},

Some of the changes detracted from this movie, but not terribly. <br><br>But the fundemental changed made to Faramire (compare him in the book to the\nmovie - not merely changed but the opposite) seriously undermined the whole\nplot of the trilogy.<br><br>Still, I have this an 8/10.

This movie is a living\nlegend, a god, and will rule for a century in my opinion.<br><br>Seriously, if you have not seen this trilogy, go and see it as soon as\npossible, as it is not just a movie about medieval times, it has\neverything a real movie should: Beautiful people (not a single ugly\nface), amazing art, incredible places (looks like heaven with skies of\nmany colors, water and so much more). The acting is superb, the best in\nthe world, they really hired the BEST out there, and as far as I can\nsee, the movie was awesome because they did not allowed the motion\npicture to be corrupted with \"political\" reasons, so, all the actors,\nPost-production, sound, effects and everything else was really the\nBEST, no corrupted piece!!!!<br><br>The story is immortal, will get you in tears no matter what you are\nmade of. The characters... so well done!!!<br><br>Do you know why this movie is so good? I will tell my opinion on it: I\nthink it is THAT good, because Peter Jackson worked on it for more than\n10 years (was forced to wait 10 years because no one wanted to give him\nthe green light to shoot), that is why, it is a good way to ensure a\ngood quality.\n"},

I can [barely] accept the whole 'Arwen as\nFrodo's\nsaviour' from The Fellowship Of The Ring, but what Jackson has done this\ntime made me feel nauseous - I actually felt the desire to vomit while\nwatching this movie. The movie started and seemed to rush forward without\nany sense of coherency or sense of timing, and then they started on the\naction to blind the audience to the significant gaps in the plot.

There's a wonderful moment where he says to\nLee, \"But we'd need an enormous army for that !!\", to which Lee strides\nto a balcony and looks down at a colossal orc army amassed outside. And\nin particular Serkis, who never appears on screen (Gollum is\ncomputer-generated) but performed on set, motion-captured the\ncharacter's moves and provided his incredible voice. For me, Gollum is\nthe key character in the movie and he is brilliantly realised, bursting\nwith pathos, rancorous bile and schizophrenic nuttiness (\"We hates\nBagginses !! We hates them forever !!\"). Howard Shore's excellent score\nand the outstanding effects work by Richard Taylor, Jim Rygiel and\nRandy Cook (the battle for Helm's Deep setpiece especially is a\nstunning composite of live-action and effects) serve to make this film\neven more spectacular than its predecessor.

Sam is willing to risk his\nlife to help Frodo, and expects nothing in return. For me, that was\nvery devoting.

{"review": "\nIn a trilogy, the second part is always the most difficult to create\nbecause it loses the charm of the discovery and lacks the thrill of the\nconclusion. The goal is to develop the characters and conclude with a\nsolid cliffhanger that will be resolved in the last part. Thus, it's\nnot just passing by.<br><br>Unfortunately, this movie is this kind. It fails to reach classics as\n\"Star Wars V\" or \"BTTF 2\" and it's as dull as \"Star Trek 3\". Nothing\nreally fundamental happens here: it's just another steps in the\njourney. Moreover, the fluidity of the first movie is lost because the\ncharacters are now split into three groups. I dozed two times watching\nit: in the Rohan country and during the Helm's Deep battle.<br><br>But the responsibility goes to Tolkien because LOTR aren't really three\nstories but a huge, colossal single story divided in three parts by the\neditor. And a night rainy battle will be always more exciting on a\npaper than on screen.<br><br>To leave on a happier note, i must say that the extra are interesting\nand really help to understand all the passion that people have put in\nthis trilogy. That's why the chain-maker is so funny: With his\ndesperate and weary voice, he explains that armors needs thousands of\nrings, that rings come in three models and that in a day of work, he\ncan chains as much as a big scarf!\n"},

The two towers basically follows their\nadventures and shows how Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are all\nreunited, Merry and Pippin are rescued by the ents after their captors\nare attacked, and Frodo and Sam encounter the creature Gollum and ask\nhim for help in getting to Mordor.<br><br>The Two Towers is a much more complicated story, as there is a subplot\ninvolving a falling kingdom and their struggle to survive as orcs are\ntrying to destroy them all. The Two towers is another feast to the eyes\nand imagination just like The Fellowship of the ring.

They should have included much more\nfrom the book and made this story a movie on its own.<br><br>A love story staring Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler could have been a\nhit. It would have given the scriptwriter an opportunity to really\nfocus on the love between Arwen and Aragorn, and Arwen's decision to\nbecome mortal, thereby forsaking her chance to ever see her family\nagain.

{"review": "\n\nAbsolutely fabulous. I really don't understand the spotlighted review's\ngrudges against this movie.<br><br>Some points I thought I'd like to rebuke:<br><br>- He noted that he went to the theater thoroughly excited at the prospect\nof\nwatching a JRR Tolkien film of Lord of the Rings, when in fact the\ndirector's name is Peter Jackson. If he wanted the \"true\" Tolkien\nexperience\non celluloid, I hear there's going to be a projection of the unabridged\ntext\nonto a classroom screen somewhere in Oregon.<br><br>- He also noted that Return of the King is the longest of the trilogy. The\nFellowship of the Ring is the longest - RotK is helped along by the hefty\nappendices, which we can't expect to see in the movies. Thus, Jackson's\nmoving of Shelob to RotK is understandable when you realize that tTT\nactually has a ridiculous amount of stuff going on.<br><br>- As for his misspelling of Arwen, it looked more like Eowyn. In which\ncase,\nwhat movie did you see?<br><br>- A \"real\" Tolkien fan would have questioned the inclusion of the elves at\nHelm's Deep, or Faramir's sudden detour to Osgiliath. Anyway, why bother\nwhen we've been presented with this wonderful gift?<br><br>And that about sums up my take on this movie. I've just recently seen the\nextended version of the Two Towers, and I absolutely applaud the editing\nthat went into making this movie. While the deleted scenes are wonderful\nfor\nbackground and such, the finished and final movie that hit theaters is the\nstronger for the editing. It takes a director and crew with vision and\nquite\na bit of brass to make those decisions.<br><br>I will also note that one of the most compelling war scenes EVER is\nAragorn\nand Theoden leading the charge down the ramp and into a see of enemies.\nIn-cre-di-ble.<br><br>Here's to December 17th!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie is so good. It gives me that feeling I used to get when I was a\nkid and a new Star Wars flick was coming down the pipe. All of the modern\ntechnological advances in moviemaking find raison d'etre in this saga\nwithout smothering the story in large production 'pomp and\ncircumstance'.<br><br>Yeah yeah, we can all get p***y about how the story wasn't followed to the\nletter and how license was granted in the embellishment of certain\ncharacters but we have to see this work for what it is, a MOVIE. MOVIES\nare\nnot BOOKS. Anyone who uses this argument to downplay their opinion of\nJackson's (et al.) attempt needs to revisit my previous statement. You\ncannot compare the two works as if they were the same variety of fruit and\none is lacking in bouquet or has artificial color or flavoring. This\nreasoning is inherently flawed. Let's all give credit where it is due.\nTolkien is the master of his world. Jackson is obviously a maestro in his\nown arena. I am so stoked that he has accomplished this with such aplomb.\nIf\nwe want to get upset at modern movie adaptations of excellent stories, why\nnot pick on the Grinch or Interview With The Vampire or the impending\nAlexander The Great movie(s) (I may be jumping the gun on this last one,\nbut\nwhy anyone would highlight the sexual practices of the greatest, most\naccomplished leader of ALL time as if it meant something is moronic\nespecially considering the common practices of the day (I urge Baz and\nOliver to read some J.F.C. Fuller on Alexander, please!). I would venture\nto\nsay that, in the distant future if movie-like entertainment exists, no one\nwould make a big deal out of how our modern leaders conducted themselves\noutside of the diplomatic/political/militaristic arena.)<br><br>Hollywood misses the mark in so many ways. Why we would get so wrapped up\nin\nthis silliness is beyond me. Three cheers for Jackson and\nCompany!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nOh man, where's a thesaurus when you need one!<br><br>If you hadn't noticed, I absolutely LOVED this movie! Violence, greed,\npower, lust, corruption, betrayal ... it has all the makings of a biography\nof a congressional lobbyist, but without the glitter.<br><br>The first movie was a bit \"too busy\" for my taste. I prefer to inhale every\nnow and then. This movie seemed better balanced and even during the enormous\nfight scenes, there was enough pause to blink. <br><br>The bad guys seemed somehow more real in this version also. Maybe because\nyou got to hear some of them talk now and then. Seeing the monsters\nbickering about not having enough fresh food to eat and whining about doing\na five day forced march also made them (dare I say) .. more\nhuman.<br><br>Anyway, I can't wait for the final chapter.  I don't think I could survive\nthe 9-hour marathon viewing of all three chapters (my friends are all ready\nfor it), but I certainly will be in line for the first opening in my area\nfor the final chapter. If it's half as good as Two Towers, I won't be\ndisappointed.<br><br>Gee ... I guess I should go read the books now!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWell, we just watched the new DVD extended version, and There are no words\nto say how good it is!<br><br>All the added sequences are a real pleasure, and the whole movie is so\nenjoyable now. It was before, but it is so much better!<br><br>Again, THANK YOU Peter Jackson and your team! I can't wait to see The\nReturn\nof the King... see you December the 17th :)))   \n"},
{"review": "\n\nI enjoyed the theatrical Two Towers even more than the first - it was\ndarker, more suspenseful, more action-filled, and introduced some of my\nfavorite characters. The extended edition gives viewers even more of the\nsame - more heart, more comedy, more action, more character development,\nmore sorrow, and more of a conclusion. My favorite scene in the extended\nedition is Faramir's flashback to a time spent with his brother and father.\nIt really shows more insight into this character, making him seem less like\nBoromir-lite. It also shows more insight into Boromir himself, before he\nleft for Rivendell, and introduced viewers to their father, Denethor, who is\nimportant to the third part of the tale. There's a lot more Merry &amp; Pippin,\nTreebeard, and Gollum. The DVD extras are fantastic, as we've come to\nexpect. Watch \"Cameras in Middle Earth,\" \"Tolkien: Origins of Middle-Earth,\"\n\"From book to Script\" and the entire special on Gollum and music and sound\nin The Two Towers. (With 4 hours of extras, these are what I found to be the\nbest) Really fascinating stuff here. The downside? The wait for \"The Return\nof the king\" seems even more unbearable now! \n"},
{"review": "\n\nWhat an excellent film.\nAgain, I will point out that I was not a fan of the \"Lord of the Rings\"\nbooks.<br><br>I saw the first movie and was blown away. It got my interest. Then I saw\nthis second installment, and I was even more blown away. And yes, everything\nyou heard about Gollum is true. He steals the show here.<br><br>But Gollum has alot of competition. I was so captivated by the battle\nscenes, they were real. If anyone really wants to see how a war is waged and\nhow it is fought (anything goes!), this is a place to start.<br><br>I am saddened that this installment did not get named Oscar Best Picture for\nout of all of the Nominees, I would have chosen this over the MUCH overrated\n'Chicago' any day. To do sequels in Hollywood is a mainstay these days.. but\nto Produce a sequel that is better than the first is rare (See the Godfather\nII for details) and this film is right up there with that kind of\nbrilliance.<br><br>A must not miss!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nIn order to make a watchable movie that is under 35 hours\nlong,\ntie it together thematically, and remain faithful to the overall\nplot,\nis no easy task. Many American and some European film-goers\nbelieve\nJackson should have done a word for word movie, but then again it's hard\nto\nhave some studio fund one movie that would require cots.\nMany American film-goers (mainly American teens), are angry there\nwere\nno heavy rock bands or rap in the movie, no Tarrantino type\nmindless\ngore and violence and no explicit sex. Many are angry that\nthis,\nGod Forbid, was a movie with European characters and that Will\nSmith\ndidn't play Frodo, and it was not a movie about an invalid or a\nconcentration camp (which seem to make up all of the Academy\nAward\nmovie winners for the last ten years). In short, in modern\nAmerica,\nwe want the kind of garbage you can see\nin still-born crap like the newest matrix - guns blasting every\nfive\nseconds, multi-cultural raves, mystical mumbo-jumbo and a\nmovie\nfilmed in a variety of shades of green.\nIf, on the other hand, you read the Lord of the Rings, loved it and\nunderstand a one-to-one translation to the screen is impossible,\nyou will love the Two Towers. I guess that is what is making alot of\nreviewers really angry - the Two Towers has gotten a very high\nscore\non IMDB. There's a great reason -the movie is excellent.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI am in the \"purist\" camp and find Jackson's work to be almost\nunwatchable.\nI have read the entire Lord Of The Rings sequence at least 20 or 30 times\nthrough my late childhood to adulthood, and for all it's flaws it is still\na\nmasterpiece.<br><br>It is unfilmable, in Jackson's own words, so he has set himself up for\nfailure.  For all his technical prowess, and the amazing achievements by\nhis\ncreative team, this work lacks the depth of Tolkein's vision, and instead\nof\nrequiring of us some imagination, it blinds us with special\neffects.<br><br>Omissions are to be expected in a work of this scale - you can't take such\na\nlarge tome and condense it, even into three movies, without losing some of\nthe plot.  But why make up plots that aren't there?<br><br>In Jackson's middle earth, men are weak, prone to corruption, that is why\nIsildur takes the ring for himself and that is a theme that Jackson seems\nto\ncatch onto and run with.  Why?  There are other themes of Tolkein's which\nwere valid and valuable and would still speak to a modern\naudience.<br><br>I appreciate that Tolkein's work lacked strong female voices, and have no\nproblem with Arwen's character being built upon and extrapolated to a\ndegree\n- her \"rescue\" of Frodo in Fellowship is quite thrilling I suppose, but\nthis\nwhole dream sequence in TTT with a whinging Elf princess and her\noverbearing\nfather - characters I don't recognise whatsoever from Tolkein's work - add\nnothing to the story.<br><br>The sacking of Isengard by the Ents brought a tear of joy to my eye, but\notherwise I found this middle movie dull, unimaginative, and very much a\nvictim of \"hollywood spin\".<br><br>Let's hope the Return Of The King offers some satisfaction.\n"},

{"review": "\n\n     I give TTT a 10, not because its perfect, but because its strengths so\nfar outweigh its weaknesses.  Like others it was disappointing to see the\ndivergence from the Book, particularly regarding Faramir and the Frodo/Sam's\ntrip to Gondor.  It didn't make Faramir more real to me, as the screen\nwriter argues, only less like Tolkien saw him (its sad that some people\ncan't believe that there are those who resist temptation).<br><br>     Otherwise the film is such a pleasure to watch and become immersed in. \nYou really get to see the world of Middle-Earth and experience the magic\nthat originates from Tolkien's Masterpiece.

I was left only\nwanting more and would have been willing to sit through another 3 hours to\nsee ROTK immediately after, as I hear they are doing in some theaters the\nday before ROTK comes out in December.<br><br>     Golem was the best supporting actor ever in any film.  Yes he was CGI,\nbut he was a compilation of many hours of human effort and expression --\nbrilliantly done.

{"review": "\nPerhaps it's the lessened necessity for basic exposition, perhaps it's\nJackson's greater willingness to depart from the precise events\ndepicted by Tolkien, but for whatever reason, THE TWO TOWERS mostly\n(but not entirely) overcomes the superficiality and rushed feeling that\nmarred its predecessor.<br><br>That's not to say there isn't a misstep here and there: in particular,\nAragorn's fall and recovery is utterly pointless, and the Ents lose\nmuch in the translation to film.
