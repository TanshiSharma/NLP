{"review": "\nI was on the Irish premier of the movie last Thursday with Simon Pegg\nand Nick Frost showing up and saying few words before the movie . First\nof all, I would like to say great cast especially Sigourney Weaver ,\nJason Bateman and my two mini stars of the movie Bill Hader and Joe Lo\nTruglio as agents Haggard and O'Reilly . The movie its self is very\nfunny and the script well written , the small alien with voice from\nSeth Rogen its very real and well made by CG artists . Obviously the\nchemistry between Frost and Pegg is great like always ( you know what\nI'm saying if you remember Shaun of the dead or Hot Fuzz )Rogen as\nalien is a perfect cast with his IM SMOKING WEED voice and great lines\n. In summary well made , great cast , funny script what else do you\nneed for Friday night . For me seven stars\n"},
{"review": "\nHoly mother of alien, what an amazing cast. I have never before been\nsurprised by a movie so much. Didn't really know anything about the\nmovie before I've seen it and it turned out to be pretty unique. I mean\na religion-bashing comedy with a couple of geeks, an alien and\nexplosions? Slap me with a donkey beard.<br><br>I bet you will have fun watching this; even if it's not your cup of\ntea, you'll still have a couple of chuckles at the very least. The plot\nis surprisingly good (unlike what you'd expect in a comedy), now add\npro-class acting and an awesome CGI alien with super cute eyes and you\ngot a super fun times guarantee.\n"},
{"review": "\nI must admit, I laughed throughout this movie. It had every stereotype\nimaginable. Drunken, bigoted red necks, creationists Christians, Sci Fi\nnerds, Men in Black,Sci Fi movie references were in abundance. What\nmade it sophomoric was the profanity. Too much to make it funny for any\none over the age of twelve. As Paul told Ruth when she first learned to\ncurse, you must use it sparingly, and at the right time (to\nparaphrase). Profanity was used too much in this movie. I was not\noffended, but bored by it. It would have been a movie targeted for the\nolder audience if the profanity was used sparingly. I am not shocked or\ntickled by the F bomb or potty humor, or references to gays or penises.\nHowever, the appearance of veteran actors, Sigourney Weaver, Jane\nLynch, Jeffery Tambor and Blythe Danner was a delightful and funny\nsurprise. Seth Grogan was brilliant as Paul. Jason Bateman was\nconvincing as Agent Zoil. The two primary British actors, of whom I had\nnever seen were perfect. All in all, a nice surprise of a movie and a\nhoot in the afternoon.\n"},
{"review": "\nPaul. The swearing, non-religious, weed-smoking alien. This film is so\nfunny, I have seen it about 10 times and it never gets old. Seth Rogen\nis perfect casting as Paul,and Kristen Wiig fits in great as well.\nSimon Pegg and Nick Frost make complete legends in this as two 'not\ngay' science nerds. I would recommend to all that like a bit of a\nlaugh, and all those who enjoy Simon Pegg/Nick Frost films (Shaun of\nthe dead/Hot Fuzz). Teenagers would love it just as much as adults do\nbecause of it's humour and fab plot line. I wouldn't recommend if you\nare strictly religious as it may appear offensive if you are (due to\nthe religious comments, and swearing).\n"},
{"review": "\nI was thoroughly impressed with this film, it really did give me a good\nfew laughs and that's rare these days. Simon Pegg and co. have always\nbeen my favourites, I've watched everything else they've been in\ntogether and it's always funny. This was no different either -\nbasically this film is how E.T. should have been.<br><br>I won't spoil anything for anyone as I know it's annoying when that\nhappens, I just really recommend watching it if you fancy watching a\ndecent comedy that isn't like all the rest of the \"comedy\" films that\nhave been out this year. I thought it was great and I've watched it\ntwice since it came out.\n"},
{"review": "\nAt the beginning does not expect much from this movie, the way it is\nfilmed may displease some people (I personally like). Here in Portugal\nthis movie was unknown to me and some friends of mine. Someone told me\nit was a fun movie and I decided to see this movie at home by accident.\nI was not expecting that was special but after seeing it, I can say\nthat is special to the point of coming here to write a very positive\nreviews. Paul is the alien, friendliest and most fun I've ever seen. It\nis a movie that sees quite well and even after finishing, we are still\nthinking about the scenes and smiling for a while. I'm going back to\nsee him more times for sure. Strongly recommend watching this movie.\n:))))\n"},
{"review": "\nIt is funnier than I had anticipated. I thought this would be one of\nthose annoying crap humor movies that have no plot, which this kind of\nis except it does have a plot and it is very well executed. <br><br>The characters are likable even the antagonists. And the lines are\nsurprisingly witty. <br><br>Warning: it does have foul language and obvious sexual references and\nit does degrade Christianity but keep in mind it is rated R. <br><br>This movie is not going to change your life but it is good for a few\nlaughs.<br><br>So pick this up for a few laughs and watch with friends and enjoy.\n"},
{"review": "\nNot only is there intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, there's\nalso wise-cracking life! Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play nerds attending\nComic-Con who then meet a sarcastic alien (voiced by Seth Rogen). A lot\nof the movie pokes fun at Americans' stereotypes of the English, as\nwell as stereotypes of Americans, and also every conspiracy theory.\nProbably the funniest scene is when Kristen Wiig's fundamentalist\nChristian tries to convince the guys of creationism, and then when she\nattempts to curse for the first time. But more than anything, \"Paul\" is\na movie that really knows how to be funny. It's also clever how they\nhave people appear in surprising places, and how they inserted a bunch\nof references to other movies. It's simply a movie that you're sure to\nlike, assuming that you aren't the religious type. A real pleasure.<br><br>Am I the only one who thought that Jane Lynch's character looks like\nthe wife on \"Mister Ed\"?\n"},
{"review": "\nI loved this movie it was the most totally hilarious Sci Fic movie I\nhave ever seen, the movie wasn't given enough much of a rating though\nwhich sucks. If you love the little bug eyed creatures then this movie\ns for you, from making a man pee himself to being grouped by and agent\nin a costume shop this little guy was the coolest alien I have seen in\na movie ever. There is a lot of alien swearing in the movie so maybe\nnot for little kids but definitely a movie I could watch more then once\njust for the laughs I got from the funny alien parts, its nothing like\nany other alien movie you have seen before. So if your religious and\ndon't like swearing then I suggest you don't watch it, but if you love\naliens and don't mind the language then it is definitely worth renting.\n"},
{"review": "\nSPOILER ALERT!<br><br>First two thirds slow to get off ground. Mostly predicable, no likable\nlead characters for me, Paul too cocky though his attributes very\ninteresting. Safe, mainstream, common, vanilla, even for the subject.\nReally great, loved the locations, save the end. Missed chance:\nfunniest scene with Paul on phone with Spielberg could have been a show\nstopper. (Has writer ever been in room with other writers, reviewers or\nadvisers and had to defend his script? That's not how you talk.) Well\nthought out script, though. Hat's off to writers Mr. Frost and Mr.\nPegg: no one dies. Standard cinematography, nothing fun. Great\nsoundtrack. First rate production technically.\n"},
{"review": "\nI've seen this a few times now, and it cracks me up every time. My\ntaste in movie genres is quite broad, but I'll admit it tends to lean\nmore towards Sci-fi. My favourite Sci-fi movie is, and probably always\nwill be, Forbidden Planet. That said, my favourite Comedy Sci-Fi is,\nabsolutely, Paul. Even though I know what's coming, I still laugh out\nloud. There's been a long-running dialogue on here about the merits of\nthis movie as regards religion .vs. atheism. This movie is NOT a\nsounding board for that particular debate - if indeed a debate was\nneeded. The story-line seeks to use as one element, the interplay of\nthe two beliefs (non-beliefs?) in relation to the existence of other\nlife forms in the universe. Having said that, I worry that folks are\nputting way too much emphasis on these matters. It's just a very funny\ncomedy film based on a Sci-fi premise ... and I love it! Just read my\nstrap-line.<br><br>There's real life ... and then there's movies!\n"},
{"review": "\nHuge fan of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg. They make a brilliant duo,\nthey're the Action-Comedy kings, and this film proves it. Brilliant\ncomedy, great voice-dubbing by Seth Rogen, surprisingly great action\nsequences and great original story. The directing was spectacular, the\nwriting was great as well, and everything is handled fantastic. I'm\ndefinitely gonna watch this film again, had a blast with it, and\nbasically anyone who loves comedy can enjoy it. A very humorous look at\nthe mysteries behind Area 51. Greg Mottola really nailed the directing\nhere, truly enjoyed that aspect. Other than that, my only issues with\nthis film is that I wanted a little more background about Nick and\nSimon, and I wanted more background about The Big Guy, she felt kinda\ntoo mysterious and had a bit of an empty personality. Besides that, I\nreally recommend this film, if you love either Nick and Simon or just a\nfan of Comedy- check it out.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was fun and interesting. But it contains an odd, ham fisted\nattempted slam against Christianity that makes little sense. Upon the\nsight of an alien, a conservative Christian woman abruptly turns\nathiest. I'm a Christian. I've also learned all about the facts of\nevolution at the Christian schools I attended. Just about every\nChristian I know thinks that the vastness of space inevitably contains\nextraterrestrial life. This is not at all incompatible with faith. It\nwould have made just as much since if she had turned athiest on the\nsight of a vacuum or cheeseburger. I'm not sure why the writers of this\nmovie thought that Christians would lose faith upon encountering\nextraterrestrial life. It comes across as forced and ignorant. It's an\notherwise fine film. In fact, you are more likely to find a green pot\nsmoking alien that has the voice of Seth Rogen than a Christian who\nloses her faith due to the discovery of alien life.\n"},
{"review": "\nTwo British geeks go on a tour of UFO hot spots in the States after\nvisiting Comic Con in San Diego (and getting to meet - *gasp* Adam\nShadowchild!) and on the way, stumble upon a snarky, sarcastic and\npotty-mouth alien named Paul, who takes them on the ride of their lives\nin his journey to go back home after 60 years.<br><br>\"Paul\" is hilarious. But it's not the type of comedy that's for\neveryone - if you enjoy stoner comedy mixed in with geeky awkward nerdy\nhumour, then you will enjoy this. There is a lot of swearing and\nvulgarity, and it's certainly not an intelligent movie, but as I said -\nit's fun.<br><br>There are a few surprising heartwarming moments too, which I won't\nmention here for spoilers. But along with pure unadulterated silliness,\nthis movie is ultimately about friendship. Bonds that can form\nregardless of species and regardless of home planet.<br><br>I thought this would movie would be a dud, but it did not disappoint.\nDefinitely an amusing movie all around.\n"},
{"review": "\nI happened to have came across this movie last night on Film 4 and I\ndecided to check it out. The film follows two British Sci-Fi nerds who\ncome across an alien named Paul(voiced by Seth Rogen)who is on the run\nand is looking for his way home(like E.T). So they help Paul out and\nteam up with another co-pilot who happens to be blind(played by Kristen\nWigg)and together they try and help Paul out as a FBI agent(played by\nJason Bateman) is after him.<br><br>Overall I found this film funny. The special effects on Paul is very\ngood as it looks so real looking(as Paul is CGI). The acting was great\nas both Simon Pegg and Nick Frost worked on this film and have starred\nin numerous films before like Hot Fuzz or Shawn Of The Dead.And the\nrest of it was funny too. Keep an eye out for Jane Lynch,Tangled's\nJeffrey Tambor and The Lucky One's Blythn Danner(as the woman who first\nseen Paul years ago).\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film is one of my favorite comedies of all time. Not just by the\nfact that it's hilarious as hell, but because of they successfully\nmanaged to blend in science-fiction, action and crude humor.<br><br>The cast is superb, it's like someone entered my mind and recollected\nmy favorite comedy actors. Bringing together Judd Apatow and Pegg &amp;\nFrost was one then weirdest combinations I've seen, but surprisingly,\nIt worked better than anyone would imagine.<br><br>The screenplay was well-written and the CGI animation is unbelievable.\nAnd surprisingly, it had no plot holes in the storyline. This shows\nthat Pegg &amp; Frost are one the best duos in comedy.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis was one of the best sci fi/comedies I have seen in years. One of\nmy co-workers was very insistent that I see this, and I'm glad he\ntalked me into it! Two sci fi addicts are returning from a convention\nwhen they pick up two unexpected \"guests\":an alien and a female\nreligious zealot. Paul is the alien, and conflicts between him and the\nlady, as well as his hilarious lines and observations from the addicts,\nprovide most of the humor. It is a marvelous combination of such genres\nas science fiction, comedy, and \"road buddy.\" There are allusions to\nsuch films as The Blues Brothers, Alien, and Close Encounters of the\nThird Kind-you will need to watch closely to catch them. Catch this gem\nof a film-Paul is a terrific character! I absolutely loved this film\nand you will too.<br><br>*** 1/2 out of ****\n"},
{"review": "\nI think the most problematic part of making a comedy with an alien is\nnot to have it become to cheezy, too childish, \"too much human\"\nperhaps? In the case of Paul it seems that by making it more down to\nearth and cheezy beyond any measure a kind of \"the movie is so bad it's\ngood\" effect, though in a very positive way, is achieved. Paul is not\njust funny but it's original, it also re-invents many jokes in a way\nthat doesn't seem to be ripping off any other movies. The movie is\nenjoyable from start to finish, with a number of interesting twists and\nis entertaining even though some jokes are just childish, but have just\nthe right amount of adult humor that will keep 99% of the audience\nlaughing. If you have not seen this movie - get your friends together,\nget some beers and a pizza and have a fun evening. Paul delivers in\nevery scene.\n"},
{"review": "\nI really enjoyed most aspects of this movie. It was a fun alien romp.\nHowever, I am not a fan of Seth Rogen. I find most of his films force\nvulgar language where it isn't needed. <br><br>Yes, vulgar language is a part of our lives and it has a place in\ncinema. But it's as if they forced vulgar language into scenes in this\nmovie that just sounded forced. Natural vulgarity adds to the realism\nof a film, but here, there was just too much that added nothing. <br><br>As far as the movie itself, I rather enjoyed it. Nothing epic, nothing\nOscar worthy, but a fun film to watch.<br><br>I rated a 6, but if the forced vulgarity was kept to a normal amount, I\ncould have given it a 7.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have to admit, that I was surprised by the language that is being\nused in the movie. Then I saw the rating and it kinda made sense\n(R-rating in America), though I didn't expect them to go that way. But\nwhile the way is what's important, it's also what might turn people a\nbit off the movie, especially the first 20 minutes might seem a bit\nslow. Something the rest of the movie will make up for! <br><br>One of the things I was sad about, was the fact I knew the \"Bird\" joke\nfrom the trailer. It would've been great to just watch it unfold on the\nbig screen. But the movie has quite a lot of gags and it is obvious\nthat Nick Frost and Simon Pegg get along great, even when not on a\nscreen or a movie set. Their chemistry (combined with that of out title\nhero) make the movie more than watchable! Not politically correct mind\nyou!\n"},
{"review": "\nPaul is a film I expected to be like Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead\n(which were good) But instead it was a complete... well... disaster!\nThe plot is simple and to be honest was quite interesting. I liked the\nscene where Paul is in the Indiana Jones warehouse. The two main\ncharacters played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were extremely funny and\na joy to watch. But here is what I don't like : The first half of the\nfilm was entertaining and really funny, but the second half was really\nawful. The reason why in my opinion was that in nearly every line\nsomeone swore. And it wasn't just a normal swear word like in most\nfilms. They were used in every scene and eventually I thought to my\nself, why am I watching this when I could be watching something better?\nBut this is why I gave Paul a 5/10.

{"review": "\nI thought this movie might be pretty funny and witty based on the movie\npreviews. I got about 3 laughs out of the entire movie. The alien\ncharacter was like some little punk foul mouth teenager but wearing an\nalien outfit. The potty mouth language wasn't funny. I think they\nthought if it was came from an alien it would funny. It wasn't. Then a\nthird of the way through the movie they start this\nanti-God/Religion/Christian theme. The movie made believers look like\nredneck idiots. I let that go in the first scene but it kept going on\nuntil the end of the movie when the father said \"God bless you\" and the\nalien said \"Yeah, whatever. You can't change those people\".

Not sure if this was to be a true\ncomedy or a weak attempt at satire focusing on ET and other early space\nalien movies. The movie starts off promising with Comic Con and a few\ngood laughs at nerdy stereotypes. Then jumps into a few typical jokes\nof laughs at homosexuals and straights but falls very flat.

{"review": "\nFor the most part I enjoyed this movie, but it seemed a bit rushed and\nshallow.

Maybe they were just\nhaving too much fun on their U.S. road trip.<br><br>I also found too much of the acting overly hammy. Somebody has to play\nthe straight man, but there's little of that. I could've used a little\nless toilet humor as well.

Trust me, if you are a bit nerdy like me, you\nare gonna love it. Even if nerd movies are not your cup of tea, this\nmovie is not gonna disappoint you. 10 rating for all the fun and\nentertainment.\n"},
{"review": "\nA cool film to spend hour and a half on. I watched it quite long ago,\nso I don't really remember details. I remember that the film had some\ngood humour in it and provided witty references about a lot of stuff.\nThis is the kind of films I sometimes want to watch on my spare time.\nI'd like to hear from the director in the future, even though I\ncouldn't watch Superbad to the end (It gained some good critic). Maybe\nit was due to poor quality of my version of the film. Cast, as I\nremember did their job OK. I don't even know what to write next, I\nwanna just leave these brief notes for myself, not attempting for them\nto be useful for other people. If anyone is aware of more convenient\nway to do so, please tell me.\n"},
{"review": "\nA super way to spend an evening in the cinema. The film is tightly made\nin the same manner as Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz &amp; Shaun Of The Dead;\nbrisk, witty and with a sharp eye not only for referencing other films\nbut also other filming techniques. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are on\ngood form. Jason Bateman is a nice, straight-faced addition and Kirsten\nWiig actually takes over the funny once she is introduced. The\nmotion-capture of Seth Rogen for Paul is high quality and Rogen himself\nis very entertaining.<br><br>The creationist issue is a little over-played (although not to the same\nextent as in Ricky Gervais' The Invention Of Lying). More effective are\nthe little moments that play on the wonder of supernatural\nintervention; the episode with the sparrow, for example.<br><br>A film-lovers flick but nothing like as nerdy as the critics might have\nsuggested - nor as nerdy as the characters themselves. 6/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI enjoyed this movie, if you are looking for a great Comedy/Sci-fi type\nfilm I would highly recommend this film.<br><br>The reason I give it an 8 is because it portrays Christians in a\nnegative light - not all Christians are like these crazy people\nportrayed in the movie and also I am a Christian myself. Christianity\nis not a list of rules &amp; does/don'ts as this movie portrays I.e. don't\nsmoke, don't cuss, don't etc...<br><br>Christianity is a relationship with God not the list of does &amp; don'ts\nor a laundry list.<br><br>Other than that I enjoyed the film very much.\n"},
{"review": "\nTwo English geeks take a road trip across America and run into a foul\nmouthed alien. Surprisingly enough, Paul is the joke that becomes least\ntiring throughout this film. He isn't always trying to be offensive,\nand actually brings a little heart and soul to the piece. I found there\nto be a lot of unnecessary Christian bashing going on throughout. As it\nwas done without the slightest hint of satire, and in the movie God is\ndisproved by the existence of a fictitious alien, it seemed a poor\nargument. Otherwise it's quite fun. It never had me laughing out loud,\nbut I was mildly amused. Unfortunately, towards the end it is nothing\nbut quotes from greater film. I mean the entire last 20 minutes seemed\ncomprised of quotes delivered in all seriousness by the cast. Will aid\na nice drinking game for cinephiles, but was tiresome while sober.\n"},
{"review": "\nI just rented the movie Paul. I was expecting to see a movie similar to\nGalaxy Quest, which, being a Star Trek fan, I found hilarious. Paul had\na great plot. The characters played well off each other and there were\na lot of funny scenes. <br><br>But toward the middle of the film it introduced a strong anti-Christian\ncontent that ruined the movie for me. It was straight up offensive and\nit wasn't necessary. It added nothing to the plot. The film would have\nbeen so much better without it. Why would someone want to insult their\naudience? <br><br>I watch a film to be entertained. And Paul would have been very\nentertaining had it not been for the anti-Christian slap in the face\nthat pervaded the second half of the film. This wasn't well thought\nout.\n"},
{"review": "\nMy friends and I gave \"Paul\" a shot last weekend. I wasn't too hopeful\nas the trailer didn't make the movie seem all that great. I was\npresently surprised at how funny it was. As much as I am already tired\nof Seth Rogen, I thought he was a really great choice as the voice of\nPaul. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were also a good choice for this movie.\nThe only thing that really turned me off about the movie was it's\nagenda. Throughout the movie, the writers continually portray\nChristians as sensational, ridiculous idiots and heavily promote\nscience. I suppose maybe I shouldn't expect a lot different from a\nsci-fi comedy, but it irritated me. I feel that the movie was funny,\nbut nowhere near \"Hangover\" funny. It's in the category of movies that\nwill be continually shown on Comedy Central in 2-3 years, much like\nShaun of the Dead and Super Troopers. I give it a 7.\n"},
{"review": "\nPaul is the name of a dog who, one assumes, the Alien originally\nrescued but then disposed of. This only occurs to you after thinking\nabout why some things just don't seem to match up when you watch this\nfilm for the first time. There are other conceits that probably fly\nstraight over the audience's heads too. Never mind, this is a healthily\nfunny take on sci-fi and the people who love the genre. It takes a\nnumber of affectionate sideswipes at the icons well known to all of us.\nIt reminded me of the live mime show based on the puppet series created\nby Gerry Anderson, \"Thunderbirds\". Funny because you can't really take\nsome fictions seriously can you? A great laugh, just unfortunate that\nthe writing wasn't given to a professional screenwriter to provide rude\ndialogue without so much need for expletives.\n"},
{"review": "\nI enjoyed this film, I caught myself laughing out loud a couple of\ntimes, and spent most of the film with a happy grin on my face.<br><br>There is often something very different about British comedies financed\nby and made for America. The good side is they have some kind of happy\ngrin warmness to them that I like. The negative side is that the cut of\nreal British humour is often removed. During Paul I could not help (as\nI happily smiled along) that Pegg and Frost were holding back. For a\nlot of jokes I wanted to to carry on and 'finish it off' - follow the\njoke to its cruller, harsher, ruder, British end. <br><br>So, how was this \"British American\" comedy? I enjoyed it.

{"review": "\nAfter watching the reviews and the trailers for Paul I have some\nquestions.

I know\nthat Seth Rogen was supposed to have developed the character, but the\nresemblance is amazing. It is also an interesting coincidence that two\nguys seem to meet Paul after a Comic-con convention.

Having tried and\nfailed at all these elements there is no time to get to know the\ncharacters enough to make them believable or to fully exploit the idea\nof a comedy alien. Rather than being placed in funny situations Paul\nthe alien seems to exist purely to lecture us in an unsubtle way about\nhow idiotic Christians are.
