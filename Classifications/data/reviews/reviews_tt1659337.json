{"review": "\nWent to an advance screening expecting your usual \"shy kid in high\nschool learns to stick up for himself\" sort of feel-good drama. This\nmovie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the mature\nthemes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and\nalcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the\nQ+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional\naspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I really cared\nabout these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their story\nnever felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see this\nmovie!\n"},
{"review": "\nStephen Chbosky has taken his exceptional novel and made it an\nextraordinary film. As the opening credit rolled I was impressed with\nthe quality of the cast including Emma Watson, Paul Rudd, Kate Walsh,\nand Dylan McDermott. And to top it off, Joan Cusak is there as well.<br><br>This is a story of coming of age and coming to terms of a boy entering\nhigh school and adulthood. Freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) almost by\naccident becomes friends with Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his stepsister\nSam (Emma Watson). Soon he is hanging out learning about the ins and\nouts of being a teen. But there is something that is left unsaid, is it\nabout his last best friend or his aunt.<br><br>Chbosky must have been blessed by John Hughes. Not only capturing this\ntimeless story with every word and sight, the film's soundtrack blows\nme away. Not many can take a book of such depth and keep the heart and\nsoul of it alive, but it happened here. Go to the theatre and see it.\nCheck out the book and read it. But most of all, Stay Infinite!\n"},
{"review": "\nSaw this movie at TIFF and after watching the trailer was thinking I\nwas going to enjoy this movie. Those expectations now are so very low,\nthis movie is amazing. It speaks on many different levels of being a\nteenager, dealing with death, loneliness, and how awkward it can be\ntrying to fit in. I haven't seen a move like this in a very long time\nand was very refreshing. The highlight of the film for me at least from\na acting stand point is Ezra Miller really funny, but very heartfelt at\nthe same time. Don't get me wrong the whole case is amazing (Emma\nWatson was perfect for this after HP) but Ezra really stands out.\nStephen Chbosky really cared about this book, and it really shows in\nthis film. Him Directing and writing his own book was a amazing idea. <br><br>It's going to get many comparisons to a John Hughes film, and\nrightfully so this movie is heart felt and just amazing. <br><br>I will definitely being seeing this film again.\n"},

I feel due to lack of advertisement\nthat it will be overlooked with other big blockbuster films but I\ntotally related to this film and LOVED IT !!! I haven't even heard\nabout this film until I was invited to a screening...saw the trailer\nand really wanted to see it but the trailer does not do it justice.

{"review": "\nI just saw the movie at the Pgh premiere and it was amazing. I was\nhoping I wouldn't be disappointed because I loved the book so much. The\nmovie is very true to the book. A few things have been omitted or\nchanged but it doesn't change the mood of the story. I think the\ncasting choices were spot on. Emma Watson has a scene in which she\ntears up and cries and it was amazing. I also appreciate how Chbosky\nmade the parents thoughtful people, unlike most teen comedies. I am\ndefinitely going to see this movie again because there was so much to\ntake in. Very well done.<br><br>It's also lovely to see my hometown as the backdrop. Pgh is a beautiful\ncity and coming out of the Fort Pitt tunnels into the city is an\nexperience that isn't quite captured well enough in the film. It's\nstill a powerful scene and I teared up watching it.\n"},
{"review": "\nMostly a trite and clich\u00e9d high school picture. Logan Lerman is miscast\nas a moody high school freshman (who looks like he' at least 16) who\nbefriends a group of seniors (Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Mae Whitman\nchief amongst them) who help him come out of his shell. That's not too\nunbelievable, but it becomes increasingly silly when Whitman becomes\nromantically involved with him, and Stone, on whom Lerman is crushing,\nwould probably be game if she weren't already involved. This plays out\nlike a fantasy, not reality. If you've ever been in a high school as an\nadult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors - Hell,\nfreshmen and sophomores - is hugely pronounced. Even among\nalterna-kids, no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a\n14/15 year old. I couldn't quite get over that, but that's hardly the\nonly flaw. Ezra Miller is definitely the stand-out. His homosexual\ncharacter is a bit clich\u00e9, but I was happy that they actually weren't\nafraid to give him a sex life (though not graphic, I'm surprised it\ndidn't land an R-rating because of it).\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm not sure. I wanted to like this film, but I felt like I'd seen it\nall before elsewhere and better. The narrative is a little too crowded\nfor it's own good - and no one gets full attention, though all deserve\nit. Unlike some, I think the script might have benefited from being set\nin a specific time and place (it is, 1990's Pittsburgh - but it is\nnever stated). Like so much of this MTV book of the month selection, it\ntries to be universal instead of specific - even in it's characters.\nJoan Cussack is billed, but her role amounts to two scenes at the VERY\nend of the film, so (although she's no 'star' attraction) you spend\nmost of the time thinking \"I thought Joan Cussack was in this?\" But I\nguess this film is meant for a generation who doesn't know Joan\nCussack, is texting during the credits, and doesn't know Pittsburgh,\nand wasn't alive in 1990.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film is about a shy high school misfit who becomes a cool guy\nafter two seniors taking him under their wings.<br><br>\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" tells a story of a shy guy who\nblossoms socially as he develops friendships with two step-siblings. It\ninvolves the typical American high school life; with experimentation in\nsex and drugs, experiences with dating, fights and bullying. I can see\nhow a lot of people can identify with the characters and events in the\nfilm, and hence \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" gets such a high\nrating. However, I think it is overrated. I thought it was a plain\ncoming of age drama. It doesn't push that many boundaries, and there is\nnothing new. The story is not particularly captivating, and in fact the\nsubtle subplots (involving flashbacks) can be confusing. My friends and\nI did not agree with the positive critics and the high ratings.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst world problems of rich suburban kids: The Movie. Or basically, a\nfeature-length episode of Degrassi.<br><br>This movie is filled with such whiny, pretentious, self-righteous,\nself-pity wallowing, predictable, teenage melodrama, that is so falsely\nattributed to be 'deep' and 'on point' that it's just plain hard to\ntake seriously in any stretch of the word. It's also an enigma; it's a\nfilm that many teenagers pretend to identify with, even though its view\nof typical teenage American life is so hollow, vacuous and\nfalsified...not to mention, very exploitative of real insecurities that\nteenagers feel, which are only used as superficial character 'defining'\ntraits, never to be elaborated on, to gain audience sympathy. It also\nonly touches on teenagers that live in wealthy suburban areas, making\nfor a very narrow field of their target demographic to represent. It\ncomes across as so insincere and manipulative that it's actually rather\ninfuriating and insufferable.\n"},
{"review": "\nMovies like this are a disservice to real life kids in actual high\nschool today. No manic pixie dream girl (and her inclusive sidekick)\nreally exist, certainly not in high school, and no unsuspecting nerd is\ngoing to be swept up into a whirlwind of acceptance and parties and\nlove affairs. If this movie weren't about something people everywhere,\nthroughout all time, ever didn't experience for themselves, maybe it\nwould be entertaining. But they do. So it's just insultingly\nsaccharine. This movie should be categorized under fantasy, it's\ncertainly not relatable for kids, I think it only really serves as a\nguidebook for the MPDG wannabe's. IE: it's tripe. Thank goodness I\ndidn't see this while I was actually in high school and actually\nstruggling or this would have made me feel worse.\n"},

I\nthought Emma Watson looked really good, Hot even &amp; I loved Logan\nhere...Ezra was just good, great even.<br><br>It hurt because i found relations to it, perhaps that's why i cried.\nthat moment when Sam (Emma Watson) touches Charlie's lap (Logan Lerman)\nwith that look in his eyes i knew something was wrong &amp; i cried.<br><br>Some of the songs are a good pick, some are just Duh!<br><br>Asleep by The Smiths (Oh Lovely track)<br><br>Love always JC\n"},

Emma Watson (Harry Potter) is amazing and, in this movie, is\nthe perfect partner for Logan Lerman. They both alone have that spark\nneeded to be in front of a camera but together are an explosion of\nfeelings. <br><br>Regarding the subject, when you start watching the movie, you feel that\nit will be another typical High-School movie but it is not.

{"review": "\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower is a movie adapted from the epistolary\nnovel written by Stephen Chbosky about Charlie played by Logan Lerman,\na teenager who lives his freshman year of high school. He has to cope\nwith struggles such as the suicide of his best friend, his difference\ncompared to the others teenagers, problems with his family,... During\nthe year, Charlie will get closer to Sam and her step-brother, Patrick\nplayed by Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. During the movie, you learn more\nabout Charlie's life and that he has to cope with more than high school\nproblems. This story shows many teenagers' issues.I think that many\nteenagers could relate to it. I really recommend this movie or even the\nbook, because it is a very moving story.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhile this film might not be for everyone I think it's great for the\ntime that we are in. For me the film excellently portrays a story about\nbeing socially disconnected. It touched me because I can relate and I'm\nsure (especially based on other reviews) that is has touched a lot of\nother people as well. <br><br>Acting was very good if not great. Emma Watson clearly has potential\nand put in a good shift. Ezriel Miller was the standout in my opinion\nand adds more depth to the film with his character contributing so the\noverall story line and message of the film.<br><br>Definitely a must watch film for anyone looking to see a good storyline\nand take a break from all the big budget movies.\n"},
{"review": "\nNirvana had it right. This film, set in the grunge heyday, was full of\nthe teenage angst that sells films and albums, but that leaves a empty\nspace when life moves on. Sure, it is an interesting coming of age\nstory, but I am bored with it's redundancies. Not much has changed from\nthen to now so there is not so much a kudos on it being a period piece,\nas many reviews had suggested, and in the places where it should have\nshown a difference in that age and this, it was not so accurate. Also,\nas much as I love Emma Watson, she seemed timid and her American accent\nwas flimsy. The best part of this film was the character of Patrick,\nwhich is a given. The book seemed so much more profound when I read it\nin my teens, but I can't say if it is the story that had changed for\nthe film, or just me changing with age.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is my first review and its brief. I do not understand the need for\nlengthy reviews. After watching this four times in six days i felt\ncompelled to give my own ten pence worth. I've never seen a film like\nthis where i have loved all the characters. The cast are brilliant and\nstory moves along at a nice pace. The soundtrack is amazing. I love\nmovies and its very rare that one comes along like this that works on\nso many levels. I am not usually one for this sort of genre and came\nclose to taking this back before actually watching it. I am so glad i\ndid not. Its going to be a very long time before something tops this.\nThis is a feel good movie with some disturbing undertones. If you love\nmovies and want something that moves you emotionally then this is for\nyou.\n"},
{"review": "\nEvery once in awhile a movie comes along that completely surprises you.\nAfter sifting through all the major blockbusters that come out every\nyear there is always a movie like \"Perks of Being a Wallflower\",\nwritten and directed by Pittsburgh's own Stephen Chbosky, that\nsurpasses everyone's expectations and ends up being one of the best\nfilms of the year, despite being an independent film. \"Perks\" does so\nmany things right. Chbosky assembled a cast and then knocked this thing\nout of the park. He does something big blockbuster so often don't do,\nhe makes you characters that genuinely care about which makes the film\nas powerful as any other you will see this year. I highly recommend\n\"Perks\", if for no other reason than that it's by far one of the most\nheartfelt and original films you will see this year.\n"},
{"review": "\nYet another movie that I am baffled by the rating and positive\nresponse. The acting is very awkward and forced. Logan does a pretty\ngood job... he didn't talk a whole lot. He would just say his one line\nand looks would be exchanged and then end scene. Emma's accent was\nhorrendous. I swear there were moments of actually pauses and silence\nin her scenes because the three actors must not have spent enough time\ntogether because their friendship didn't seem real at all. I hate when\nmovies have to cram all these scenes from the book into a short movie,\nit hardly ever works out for the fans. I just wanted MORE from it! I\ndidn't get that deep emotional feeling I got from reading the book.\n"},

In this film ,in particular, the\norigin of these disorders is often of sexual nature, although this is\nnot the central aspect of the story. In the same line of \"Dead Poets\nSociety\" (1989 ), this film reminds the adolescence and the\nunforgettable friends who pass through our lives and make us \"feel\ninfinite.\" Almost like Remy's cooks in \"Ratatouille\" (2007 ), this film\narouses feelings and memories that are not always present, but are\ndeeply rooted in the depths of our souls.

{"review": "\nThis movie accurately can describe to teens how they can be both happy\nand sad. It will help them understand their feelings and mentality much\neasier than any counselor.

{"review": "\nThis move will excel all preexpectations you have of it, whether they\nbe good or bad. It is a film which speaks to people on all different\nlevels, and blends so many different deep and emotional aspects\ntogether (drugs, mental illness, sexual abuse...) in perfect fashion.\nThe acting from the entire cast is flawless from start to finish, and\nlike films of this nature and calibre should, you genuinely grow\nattached too and feel for the main characters. I have watched this\npicture several times and am still blown away by the superiority of\neverything from the cinematography to the soundtrack. I would strongly\nadvise everyone to watch this film; it is real, it is poignant, and it\nis truly heartwarming. 10/10.\n"},
{"review": "\nAlmost the whole movie i had seen before in others. Yet something kept\nme hooked. The characters are so likable.<br><br>Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller) are 2 seniors, who are step\nsiblings, who take freshman ,Charlie (Logan Lerman), under their wing\nand out of his comfort zone. Charlie is a very awkward and quiet guy.\nSam and Patrick are the completely opposite. The underlining story and\ntone to this movie is surprisingly dark. As much as you think it will\nbe just another Coming of age/Highschool Drama, it's not. Everyone of\nthe characters has their issues. The twist honestly was one that I had\nnot seen coming.\n"},
{"review": "\nAn introvert freshman (Logan Lerman) is taken under the wings of two\nseniors who welcome him to the real world.<br><br>It baffles me that kids who are so into underground music seem to have\nno idea who David Bowie is. That makes no sense. But I completely get\nwhat they were about. This is something I can identify with in many\nrespects, liking underground music and being in the outcast clique. We\nnever had gay drama, and I am not big on Rocky Horror (though many\nare), but I can see this.<br><br>Not a bad story overall, and it is really driven by having Emma Watson\nplay Sam. With or without her, it would be a good film, but I think she\nprovides the star power and the emotional vulnerability that really\nsell the character. She is really the only big star in the film, other\nthan those who were left to be little more than cameos (Paul Rudd, Joan\nCusack). Incidentally, great casting of Tom Savini... what the heck is\nhe doing here?\n"},

The movie makes you re-think the\npeople around you. This is the only movie I have ever given a 10/10 out\nof over half a thousand as even its flaws can be viewed as purposeful\nand necessary to the work as a whole.

This movie amazed me\nit portrays the different types of best friends and basic teenage\nproblems. This title is heartfelt while also being funny.

I have\nno words to describe how much I was impressed by his performance. Emma\nwatson has also done an amazing job in this film. She is definitely\ngrowing as an actor in every film and you can feel that in her\nperformance. <br><br>The introvert, shy boy who has an awful childhood meets a guy and a\ngirl who change his life completely.

{"review": "\nThe movie is worth watching. Although it seems a teenage movie, it can\nalso be watched from more variety of people. The soundtracks are really\nqualified. Also, the movie gives great stories from lives of the\ncharacters with bunch of many different emotions; sadness, happiness,\ncraziness. These emotions can be easily followed from the characters\nbehaviour and sayings. The movie is converted from a book.

There are a lot of\npoignant scenes in this movie and a lot of funny little things like\nmaking us older people remember about how important it was to make a\n\"mix\" tape to show your love for someone. Ezra Miller is a great young\nactor and I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of Emma Watson as she becomes\none of the few child actors that succeeds as an adult.

{"review": "\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower came recommended to me by a friend\nafter I revelled in the watching of The Spectacular Now. My limited\nknowledge of the book led me to believe it would be the standard\nintrovert kid turned popular high school socialite, like many a title\nbefore it. However, the film presented me with a tortured protagonist\nwho finds his place amongst another bunch of misfits. It is the\nrelationship of this band of friends, which is so expertly interwoven\nwith the main storyline that captured my imagination. These\nrelationships, coupled with an excellent soundtrack, helped me to reach\na profound examination of society; a realisation that despite our own\nself-doubts, that we are part of a society where everyone has their own\nissues. It is in no way a life- changing film, but it is one that will\nleave you contemplating your own social decisions.\n"},
{"review": "\nDrugs, Alcohol, Depression, this movie expresses the Pros and Cons of\nbeing a teenager, a shy kid, a wallflower. I was very surprised with\nLogan Lermans performance, he showed a lot of passion and sincerity in\nhis performance.

I have read the book and\nwhile I the movie isn't as good as the book it is pretty dang good. It\nshows teenagers have many secrets, many hardships but all together\nstick together while they find themselves in their high school journey.\nThis movie is one of my favorites and deserves to be given a 10. It\nmade me feel different after watching, more calm in a way. Watch it and\nyou wont be disappointed.\n"},

Emma gives a strong performance\nas Sam - you can tell that she really understands the character,\nhowever she does struggle a bit with the American accent. Not to worry\nEzra is hilarious but not gimmicky, and can flip to a somber tone at a\nmoment's notice and have everyone spellbound. Also great performances\nfrom Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. The young cast is\ntruly the heart of the film and are all really great. There is a lot of\nhumour, emotion, honesty, everything it needed, and also an excellent\nsoundtrack to back it up.\n"},

{"review": "\nA movie that at first seemed like it might be just another movie about\na group of high school kids and their drama. As soon as I started it\nthat thought was quickly proved false.

During the intense scene that was the fight in\nthe lunchroom, the DVD started to skip and pause. I found myself\nyelling, \"NO!\" as I quickly took the disc out and cleaned it. Luckily\nit no longer skipped. They did a very good job with the character\nbuilding and I found myself really caring about Charlie. Why is he\nhaving these blackouts? What do people mean when they say that Charlie\nhasn't seen things lately or that he has been doing really well since\nhe met his new friends? I highly recommend this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt defiantly deserves more recognition. Stephen Chbosky's book is a\ncritically acclaimed book, but the movie did live up to his book,\nseeing as he wrote, produced, directed etc. Logan Lerman as Charlie was\namazing.

Jack &amp; Bobby when he was just a teenager, 3:10 to\nYuma, and he was also very believable in Riding in Cars with Boys. Ezra\nMiller was also wonderful, he made you laugh, and he made you cry, and\nhis character was so beautiful written. I've never seen a full Harry\nPotter film, but what I've seen of Emma Watson in them and in this\nfilm, she's a wonderful actress.<br><br>I highly recommend it, one of the best films I've ever seen.\n"},

I wish there was more for Paul Rudd to do in the movie.\nIn my opinion, he is one of the most underrated actors of our times.\nAlso an honorable mention of all the other friends and Lerman's family\n(including Nina Dobrev of the Vampire Diaries fame as his sister) who\nmake up a good supporting cast in a well-rounded film.<br><br>Oh and also, Pittsburgh, PA continues to maintain the tradition of\nbeing associate with great movies.

First of all,\nthe soundtrack was perfectly selected. It displayed Charlie's confused\nemotions throughout. Being a music student (and aiming to be a music\nsoundtrack supervisor or work in the film music industry) I admired the\nchoice of songs and felt it truly reflected Charlie's character.\nSecondly, I enjoyed how well the script was acted by all of the actors.\nThey portrayed an honest awkwardness as young adults often have and yet\ntheir relationships and friendships were relatable and realistic.\nThirdly, I feel obligated to mention my respect for Logan Lerman as an\nactor and must mention how greatly he played Charlie. His\ncharacterization of such a troubled teenager was spot on and he\ndeserves great praise for portraying Charlie fantastically.\n"},

All of the cast have great\ncharacter development and Logans story is particularly harrowing. The\naccuracy with which the world of high school is presented is staggering\nand the tension of the film gradually increases right up to the heart\npounding climax.

I'm really happy that\nI've watched this, even more after i thought it was a cheesy movie with\nno concept. I was really, really wrong. Thank you Stephen Chbosky.\nAnother beautiful surprise, that made the movie even better, is the\namazing soundtrack. I'm a big The Smiths fan. It's like the movie\nactually tells many stories that Morrissey tried to tell us all these\nyears, \"Asleep\" was a perfect choice for this.\n"},

{"review": "\nIn my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) I have\ncome to number 249, which is \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\". The\nmovie is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Chbosky.<br><br>In the movie you follow Charlie, who has just moved up in High School\nafter being bullied for the last years, and if it wasn't bad enough his\nonly friend has just committed suicide.

{"review": "\nI just watched this movie for the first time. At first I thought it\nlooked like some clich\u00e9 high school movie. Of course, twenty and\nnearly-30-yr-olds play teens, which is rather unrealistic. (I'm still\nin high school and NO ONE has that nice of a complexion!) I continued\nto watch as Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, struggles to find friends.\nI also thought that was silly because this guy is very handsome and he\ndefinitely WOULD have friends, even if they'd only use him for his\nlooks. So far, it seems like I hated it. Well, Emma Watson and some\nother dude befriend Charlie and from then on, the story bursts with\npassion, confusion, secrets, lust, and a wonderfully brilliant message\nabout \"misfit\" teens. I cried at least 3 times throughout this--\ngranted, I was very exhausted today--but it contained honest humor and\nemotional connections. I would have given this a 10/10, but \"White\nChicks\" takes first place. Either way, this movie is incredible and I\nrecommend to everyone.\n"},
{"review": "\nJust seen this very good movie and I know its very late. Couldn't get\nit out of my head. IMO, a well scripted drama, inspired from novel. The\nmovie features three main teen characters, but it isn't an ordinary\nteen movie. 'Charlie' character reminds me of the young man from\n'ordinary people (1980)', which also features three main characters but\nnot teens. The songs (OSTs) from the movie are cool too. A Special\nmention to 'Come on Eileen' (\"OMG, they are playing good music...\nliving room routine\") and 'heroes' make the viewers to enjoy the movie\nbetter. Sad thing that this movie didn't fall upon the eyes of the\nacademy. STILL IT IS INFINITE!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. The\nacting in this movie is sublime. One of my favorite parts of a movie is\nthe music. This movie has, by far, one of the best soundtracks of any\nmovie ever made. I have always thought that Logan Lerman was an\nexquisite actor, but he has reached a whole new level of genius with\nthis movie. Emma Watson is one of those actresses that unfortunately\nhas been type cast by her portrayal of Hermione Granger, but her acting\nis so new and refreshing in this film, that you completely forget about\nher even being affiliated with the Harry Potter franchise. I have\nwatched this film several times looking for a flaw, and I'm happy to\nsay, one does not exist. Everything, from the writing, cinematography,\nproduction, and acting in this movie is one of a kind. I was hesitant\nto watch this film for the first time, but this will go down in history\nas one of my favorite films of all time. Kudos to the entire crew!\n"},

You really feel all the uncertainty, the\ninner turmoil, the self-imposed guilt and the pain that weigh down\nCharlie. His performance is so good that it's easy to overlook those\nwho play \"Nothing\" and Sam, and all the others, but everyone was\nexceptionally good, although some of the better known actors like Paul\nRudd, Dylan McDermott were definitely outshone by the three central\nactors.<br><br>At no time did you feel any acting was going on or that the dialogue\ncame from a script.

I'm Brazilian and I really don't know how it is the life\nof young north-Americans, but that was the most realistic movie about\nthe theme that I ever watched.<br><br>Along with the problematics Patrick and his friend Sam - Ezra Miller\nand Emma Watson - Charlie, who is introspective and has no friends,\nfinds a safe haven and is forced to confront the reality of his life\nand his mental issues. The slow soundtrack that includes The Smiths\nenhances the melancholy and makes everything more plausible, pushing\naway the clich\u00e9.<br><br>A great turnover on the script at the end of the movie connects all the\npoints and makes you think about your own reality.

{"review": "\nThis movie has an excellent plot. After watching this I read the book\nand could really feel the characters. For me it was like stepping back\ninto the early 90's. this movie really needs to get above a 5. I do not\nrecommend letting 8 year old kids watch this, it is to big for them.\nBut read the book and you'll Cherish this movie a lot more. watch it it\nwill bring you to tears and trust me you will have a lot of new\nfavorite songs. But I recommend watching the movie first so you can\ncompare the movie to the book while reading it. This is certainly a\nmust watch.

{"review": "\nI first wanted to see this movie, because Logan Lerman played the main\ncharacter, but then I realized that this is an amazing movie. All of\nthe actors did a great job playing in this movie. I think this is Logan\nLerman's best movie ever. Emma Watson did really good as well, this\ncharacter fitted her. This is an interesting movie for teenagers coping\nwith hard life. Love, sex, cheating, it has almost everything in it\nthat interests a teenage nowadays. The end was really moving, it made\nme cry. All in all, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, and it\nisn't the movie with the most cliffhangers and action in it, but it's\ndefinitely worth seeing.\n"},

But lets face it, the book is almost always better than\nthe movie. Anyways, this case was different. The movie touched my\nheart, it made me feel like I was actually in high school with Charlie,\nSam, and Patrick. As if i was reading the book all over again, Very\npleased with the come out. Bravo!\n"},
{"review": "\nFrom start to ending 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is truly\ncaptivating and endlessly realistic. This film instantly became one of\nmy favourites and will always remain so. As I have also read the book\nin which the film is based around I can honestly say that the entire\ncast play their parts fluently all the way through. A great thing about\nthis film is that it also manages to appeal to an impossibly wide\naudience as anyone can relate to at least one area of the film. I truly\nclass this film as a classic for its ability to have such a simplistic\nand realistic plot but yet create such a emotional and memorable\nresponse from the viewer.\n"},

I must admit\nthe first time I've watched this I was in tears throughout the entire\nfilm, not sure why but after re-watching it several times it turned\ninto my go to feel good movie. It doesn't have the clich\u00e9 everyone gets\nwhat they want ending nor does it have the everyone is miserable in the\nend thing either, the ending is one of my favorite parts of the movie\nand I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the whole \"not okay\nteenagers\" cause it takes the matter somewhat realistically.\n"},
{"review": "\nI stopped the movie 3-4 times because i could not control the feeling\nof happiness and emptiness after watching some of the scenes.

I hope you got me here :)<br><br>The story focuses more on Charlie's life but you can determine the life\nof Sam by it.

{"review": "\nI'm writing this review to so that the little tick box of things I've\ndone with my account that says \"Written a review\" will be ticked. This\nmovie is for the largely female teenage masses yearning for another\ncute and misanthropic and oh-so-relatable film to sink their fangs\ninto,dripping of tumblr giffyness. The writer knows their FRICKing\nmarket, though, and panders to it accordingly. For example, the\nprotagonist. Teenager? Check. Quiet? Check. Feels a disconnect from\nthose around him? Check.

{"review": "\nI cannot overstate how great this movie is. I'm truly sick of many of\nthese users that think they are some high class film critic. 4 out of\n10? Really? It's rare that a film encompasses so much of what it is\nlike growing up with the social and moral dilemmas that nearly every\none of us face at some point in our lives. This is literally a \"feel\ngood\" movie, that will leave you with an emotional high. It has a\nwonderful cast and an even better soundtrack.

{"review": "\nFinally! The Perks of Being a Wallflower was on my hit list of movies\nto watch but likely put on the back burner due to the predictability of\ncoming of age films that aren't always very enticing.

He doesn't but he\nconfirms that it's not always necessary to reinvent the wheel. <br><br>The writing was impressive from the outset of the movie. Chbosky does a\nphenomenal job at juxtaposing Charlie's best self narration to his\nawkward social executions. It wasn't cringe worthy but it was difficult\nlistening to and understanding Charlie's intentions and then watch him\nstruggle with expression. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller\ndeliver natural performances and never let us get too confident in\nCharlie and his abilities to adapt.
