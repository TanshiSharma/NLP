They tried to fix bad image of American\nsoldiers and the things they made \u200b\u200bin the recent wars and have made\nsome bad mix of Superman and Rambo. People are dropping tens of meters\ndown a rocky mountain, strike with a head in stone but firing\nunerringly, killing hundreds of opponents, who are naturally evil,\ndirty and sad examples of human beings. Do you remember the worst war\nmovie you watched? This one is several times worse. I can not believe\nthat anyone could give this movie a positive evaluation. In war, people\ncan overcome their opportunities, especially superbly trained soldiers\nbut there are limits to what the human body can not handle.

The pain and terror that these\nSeals went thru will have your heart pounding. If you have seen Black\nHawk Down and consider it one of your favorites, then Lone Survivor\nwill be a new favorite. The movie begins slow at a military base in\nAfghanistan and shows the military lifestyle of the Seals. They show\nclips of the camaraderie and hazing that takes place as well as the\nrelationship with their family in the states. This engages the audience\nand makes the characters human. Once the action begins with that first\nshot fired, hold on because it just keeps going from there. The main\ncharacter played by Mark Wahlberg was a great casting choice. I read\nthe book before the movie came out and when I found out Wahlberg was in\nthe movie as the lone survivor himself, I was excited.

{"review": "\nNo offense to Navy officers who lost their lives for their country. I\nrespect them dearly. I speak only for the movie as an art form.<br><br>I think the movie is another Hollywood bubble. Visually stunning but\ntells no story, and it is forgettable. The reviews I read mostly about\nhow it is accurate and how the movie awesome. I do not watch movies for\ntheir accuracy. I watch documentaries for that. <br><br>Many characters have not had time to be developed. Main four\ncharacters, they do not have enough screen time to explain their\nintension. They are just soldiers and they do what they are trained\nfor. They go, they fight, they die. This is the story. I would rather\nlearn who they are than how they died. I think director should have\nfocused on character development, instead he spent an hour on how they\njumped, how they got shot, how they killed, and be killed. It was just\ncheap story telling. I only liked the beginning (how they are trained)\nand the end (Pashtunwali).\n"},

{"review": "\n(Spoilers)<br><br>OK, but not great, modern war story. The band of brothers aspect was\ngood but a touch overdone, and is nothing new. Plus, the first few\nscenes of the movie seem full of empty sentimentality. <br><br>The first half of the movie, is on the surface, about heroism and\ncamaraderie. However, more than this, it is about military\nincompetence. The overly complex mission, so complex any small detail,\neg loss of communications, can derail it. The failure to terminate a\nmajor threat to the mission. The hung-ho, uncoordinated rescue attempt.<br><br>The first half was actually somewhat irritating, as it seemed to value\nheroism over good planning and prudent decision-making.<br><br>This is redeemed somewhat by the second half.

{"review": "\nLone Survivor is a brutally effective movie, made by people thinking\nthey're serving their country. However these people make the audience\ncoarser and more self-centered. They perpetuate the kind of propaganda\nthat sent the heroes of the Seal Team 10 to death. The film is intense\nthough but balanced by the moments of surprising tenderness, among the\nmen themselves and also in the field. The ensemble cast delivers\nproperly, working with a screenplay telling the story with considerable\nforce. The story itself is not just about a fire fight with the enemy,\nit regards more the sense of brothers in arms helping each other to\nsurvive. This is what makes the film powerful and somewhat satisfying\nin a terrible sort of way.\n"},

{"review": "\nLone Survivor further goes into the war genre, however it being a true\nstory adds emotion and further intrigue to this film. The sound and\nmusic played through out the film is captivating as well as the story\nunfolding. The story is inspiring and will appeal to large audiences\nhowever, the way the movie was presented was in a way where I myself\nand many people have seen before in a war movie. The story is touching\nand really shows the nature of the cruel Taliban as well the grit and\nfight of the American Army. There were no stand out performances and it\njust didn't blow my mind as some War movies do e.g. Saving Private\nRyan, Black Hawk Down, Apocalypse Now etc. but it is safe to say 'Lone\nSurvivor' is this generations Black Hawk Down. In summation, it is a\nwell filmed movie, done by Peter Berg with up and coming actors as well\nas Mark Wahlberg. Only 7/10\n"},

It may be tough to watch at\ntimes but I could never take my eyes of the screen. How is this\npropaganda ? How I ask. The film to me was actually more an anti- war\nmessage being portrayed as it doesn't just show the enemy as the enemy\nand it shows a different side to Afghanistan, this side we never really\nhear about. The film also packs some great performances with Taylor\nKitch and Mark Wahlberg leading the pack. The films brutality and\nrealistic warfare just adds to the tensity.

Ever little moment is subtly twisted\nfrom its real-life counterparts to cast the Americans in good light.<br><br>The movie is also overwrought with clich\u00e9s.
