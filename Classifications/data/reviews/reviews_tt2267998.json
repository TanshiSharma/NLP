{"review": "\nDark and twisted, David Fincher's stylish new mystery thriller was\nderived from Gillian Flynn's intriguingly slick tale from her complex\nand suspenseful novel. By far one of the best acting performances to\nhave come from Ben Affleck, 'Gone Girl' boasts some strong yet\ndisturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler\nPerry and Affleck. Fincher has garnered fame and recognition as a\nmainstream director, that is not only able to engulf the audience\nwithin the picture, but actually make them part of the scenario.\nFincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning\ncinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of which\nmakes 'Gone Girl' a movie full of great visual storytelling.\n"},
{"review": "\nPlease do not waste your time or money on this nonsense. Oh boy where\ndo I start. OK for me the worst thing is when she gets back and tells\neveryone that Neil Patrick Harris \"kidnapped\" her (Rosamund). He did\nthis by bludgeoning her and she lost a large amount of blood which he\ncleaned up. Then he takes her diary to her husbands fathers house to\nburn!!!!! (how does he even know of this location)?????? But he makes\nsuch a p!$$ poor attempt to burn it which would take 5 min to do\nproperly as opposed to the 30+ to clean the blood. and no one questions\nthis even once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No one even looks for any wounds or\nasks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds. Oh and\nthe hospital sends her home covered I mean a copious amount blood. No\nflipping way, the hospital would clean her looking for wounds\nespecially with this much blood.I could go on and on but just read the\nother truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaring\nmistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense. I really wish\nIMDb would have a 0 or negative review number as this does not even\nrank a 1. I give this -5 for utter bull$h1*.\n"},

Carrie Coon as Ben's twin sister and Kim Dickens as the lead\ndetective also gave excellent performances. As for the story, I can\ndeal with sad endings where the hero dies like Braveheart, Cool Hand\nLuke, and endless others. When the credits came up on Gone Girl, I\ncould only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me\nthat angry.

{"review": "\nThought this would be a good thriller, but ultimately it was draining\nand depressing. Would think any man who sees this film would never want\nto have sex again......it portrayed woman/women as being monstrous and\nmen as passive, sex-crazed zombies. The story had so many loose ends\nand unbelievable scenes, such as where she returns home covered in\nblood.....then she's at the hospital - there had to be an exam, then\ngiving an interview to detectives, then comes home still covered in\nblood....how much time elapsed during these scenes, and who would allow\nher to drive around, carry on, covered in blood for all that time? With\ngreat emphasis on crass words for women, violent sex scenes, and a\nscore that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an\nairport runway, this was one depressing film. The only place it was\nbelievable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in\ntragedy and perversion. If this becomes our prime form of entertainment\nwe are in big trouble.

{"review": "\nNever again will I trust the Metascore. Big fan of David Fincher, but\nlet me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad.

I felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie.\nAt one point my husband turned to me and whispered \"this is really bad\"\nand we started laughing. Then we started rewriting the story and\nrecasting. For example, Ben Affleck could have played his own twin\nsister and it wouldn't have made the movie any more ridiculous. You\nmight love it. I really, really did not.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe first act of the movie is the run-of-the-mill wife gone missing,\nthe husband accused of killing her plot. This is clearly established in\nthe theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers.\nTo the people who are familiar with David Fincher's work, this is not\nthe case with Gone Girl.<br><br>Yes, the first act is very ordinary, but the second act uproots\nwhatever ever considered dull about the movie as it takes a rapid turn\ninto thriller stardom, resembling something taken out of a Hitchcock\nmovie. Only a handful directors can completely enhance the movie's\nnarrative through editing, and Fincher is one of them. I know there is\na lot of praise around Rosamund Pike's performance, which makes it easy\nto overlook Ben Affleck. He plays the tired, oblivious and boyish\nreally well. This may be the very reason why he is completely\noverlooked.<br><br>And in a time of sequels, prequels, remakes and biopics, finally a\ncontemporary piece of work! Stellar!\n"},
{"review": "\nTwo movies for the price of one. <br><br>That's a fairly glib start to a review of a movie that I really liked,\nbut it is true. The first half of Gone Girl is a fairly standard \"did\nhe or didn't he\" mystery thriller. Then, about an hour in, the\nperspective shifts entirely and suddenly you realise that you're\nwatching \u0096 perhaps \u0096 the most pitch-black comedy that you've ever seen. <br><br>Despite the abrupt shift, I still think that Gone Girl holds together\nextremely well as one whole movie. Ben Affleck's Nick manages to\ninspire sympathy without ever being truly likable while Rosamund Pike's\nAmy (the star of the show in my opinion) is brilliant, terrifying,\nhilarious and despicable in various combinations and occasionally all\nat the same time.<br><br>David Fincher's direction is both classy and clever (as usual) and\nseveral scenes are particularly outstanding due at least as much to his\nbrilliance as that of the actors involved in them. My one complaint\nwould be over the length \u0096 it really didn't need to be two and a\nquarter hours long. There were certainly a few moments, particularly in\nthe first half, when I wished that the movie would hurry up and get to\nthe point just a little more quickly.<br><br>Gone Girl is a movie unlike any that I've ever seen before and as such\nlargely defies further description. I would recommend this movie to all\n(with a warning that the adult rating is well earned) but especially\nthose with a dark sense of humour. The darker the better.\n"},
{"review": "\nGone Girl is directed by the mastermind of David Fincher. Amazingly\nwritten by Gillian Flynn whom wrote the novel the film is based on.\nStarring Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as Amy Elliot\nDunne. On the day of their 5th wedding anniversary Nick's wife, Amy\ndisappears out of nowhere, and this crazy, intense and haunting journey\nbegins. David Fincher and Gillian Flynn's intelligent storytelling\ntrough out this fantastic journey will keep at the edge of your seat\nfrom start to end. The soundtrack and score is also very intense and\nhaunting, and has huge impact on the film. The performances from all\nthe actors, especially Rosamund Pike are top notch which really helps\nthe element of the realism stand out in this film. <br><br>Gone Girl is easily the best film I have seen this year so far, and I\nhave to give it a 10/10. It is also one of the best films from David\nFincher in my opinion. I strongly advice everyone to go and see Gone\nGirl, it is one thrilling ride.\n"},
{"review": "\nAfter watching over the first hour of this movie I just couldn't stay\ninterested in any of the characters or even in the plot for that\nmatter. In fact I was kind of hoping that his wife was dead and not\njust missing. I really hoped he killed her because I didn't like her\ncharacter and I really hoped Affleck would die too in a shoot out with\ncops; and I kind of hoped he would get lucky and kill them also. Well\nmaybe not the sidekick, he was cool. I just couldn't relate to all of\nthe pretentiousness of the wife's family or even Affleck himself. I\nmean, I even hoped her parents would die because they were jerks too.\nAbout the only person in that movie I found interesting was Affleck's\nsister, I think her name was Margo. The movie just failed to hook me in\nan hour and fifteen minutes. No plot twist can recover the amount of\nboredom I had at the one hour mark. Plus there were some very graphic\nscenes that didn't really add to the movie (not all, some very well\nexpressed how disturbed individuals were). I don't need to see Affleck\ngoing down on a chick on his first date to kind of figure out they\nbumped uglies. Graphic scenes have their purpose but when you over-do\nit, you lose value.\n"},
{"review": "\nI wish I could rate this movie with a 0 Maybe the first part, is OK,\nbefore anything happens. When the action starts, you see that the\nacting, the plot, everything starts to go down the drain. I must say\nthat in general the acting is very bad, and there are very stupid\nmoments. Like when the wife returns after killing her ex-boyfriend, she\nis interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood,\ntelling the story that she was raped. Well nobody cleans all the blood\nof her in the hospital, and she is in a room with at least 10 FBI\nagents that look goofy, a lot of local police, plus husband, lawyer etc\netc. Then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and\nthey go home together.

There were rave reviews in news articles both\non and offline, on social media sites etc.<br><br>I enjoyed parts of the movie even if I felt some of the characters did\nnot have a good fit with others and most scenarios were not plausible.\nThe story was interesting enough and fast enough paced to keep the\nviewer wanting more, but wanting is the key word here. The full air of\nmystery did not exist. Many areas did not leave much to the imagination\nand one was able to draw conclusion long before it played out on\nscreen.<br><br>Finally the ending failed miserably. Almost as if the writer reached a\npeak, ran out of thoughts and threw something together for a quick\nfinish. I was very disappointed. I would have given a higher score if\nnot for the movie's lack of a fulfilling end and the many unexplainable\nloopholes. Bottom line I was surprised after all the hype this movie\nturned out to be so very, very bad.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly\none of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema.\nI also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very\nfew who can match the directorial skills of Fincher. <br><br>Like many of his previous films, Gone Girl is a very long film, but in\na true Fincher-esque fashion, it is as engaging as possible without any\nscope for the viewer to feel bored. The pacing is perfect. The scenes\nhave a dreamy style to it, which brings the dilemma of \"whether this is\na true account of things or has this been made up by the narrator.\" <br><br>The theme of the film is the fact that humans at the basic level are\nall actors and pretenders. Very seldom do we decide to be our real\nselves. Generally all of us put on a mask to make ourselves look good\nin front of the general public and also to pretend to be the person\nthat our nearest and dearest want us to be. Gillian Flynn's screenplay\nbased on her own novel is brilliant and it is also a damning indictment\nof how media can shape and mould mass perception and it is also a\ncynical account of the institution of marriage.<br><br>Ben Affleck is good, Tyler Perry is good, but this movie from an acting\nperspective belongs to Rosamund Pike. She owns every scene that she is\nin and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.<br><br>Fincher has once again has made a fantastic film. The last 30 minutes\nmight not be completely logical, but it is still symbolic. If you are\nabout to get married,stay away from Gone Girl.\n"},

So you know what is\ngoing to happen what you didn't know was all the details of why, which\nfound dull, I like more of a traditional mystery/drama. Personally\ndidn't see any academy award acting. The ending was way to far fetched,\njust absolutely unbelievable that 3 law enforcement agency would just\ntake a position of \"Oh Well\", the group grope to interview her was\ntotally unrealistic, I really was wondering if this was such a low\nbudget film they just didn't have enough funds to complete the movie\nand they had to jam multiple plots in a single scene.

{"review": "\nThe ratings were so high for this movie.I was sure it would be a great\nfilm. What rubbish it was. For the first hour I kept looking at my\nwatch,it was so slow moving.

In GONE GIRL there are\nso many holes and those holes are so ridiculous, you gotta ask\nyourself, \"Do they think I'm stupid?\" I guess the answer is yes. I\nguess they are correct.

I just enjoyed\nthe ride.<br><br>'Gone Girl' is one of those films where you don't want to say too much\nabout for fear of giving things away and spoiling it for people who\nhaven't seen it. Ben Affleck plays a (reasonably) decent husband whose\nwell-to-do wife disappears. The media circus that follows then starts\nto reveal that the truth is far more complicated that it first seems\n(not to mention the obligatory police investigation). It's fair to say\nthat what follows is a film that twists and turns, so you only really\nget one chance to watch it and not know what's coming.<br><br>Many people don't really like Affleck when it comes to acting (even\nless now he's due to don the Batsuit!), but I think most people will\nrelate to him as he gets pursued and hounded (unfairly? You'll have to\nwait and see!) by the media. Rosamund Pike plays his (gone!) wife with\na flawless American accent. Again, you'll have to see whether she's\nfound alive or dead. The story bounces around back and forth in time,\nmaking sure you're just confused enough never to put too much together\nbefore the film's ready to reveal what's happening.<br><br>If I had one complaint it's that the film is a little too long. Perhaps\nten to fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around the three\nquarters mark, just to speed it up. But that's a minor gripe.\nBasically, if you like your thrillers twisty and turny (and have a\ncouple of hours to spare on a film that you really have to concentrate\non) give this one a go.\n"},
{"review": "\nRosamund Pike gives one heck of a chilling performance here as Amy\nElliott Dunne, a psychopathic and disturbed woman, whose real life\npersona is directly the opposite of that which is projected in her\nseries of \"Amazing Amy\" popular children's books. Carrie Coon is also\nsuperb as Margo Dunne, the loyal twin sister of Amy's husband Nick (Ben\nAffleck), and Kim Dickens is outstanding as the hard-nosed lead\nDetective Rhonda Boney, assigned to investigate Amy's mysterious\ndisappearance. Also, Tyler Perry is certainly believable as the hot\nshot and high priced attorney Tanner Bolt.<br><br>The movie appeared to me as a scathing indictment of the sensationalism\nof our star obsessed, media, social media, and reality TV society,\nwhere perception and appearance is everything and there's no time for\nboring things like facts and the truth.<br><br>The film is filled with a number of explicit sex scenes, lots of\nshocking and raw language, and one scene that you may have heard about\nwhich is literally brutally bloody and horrific.<br><br>The acclaimed filmmaker David Fincher (The Social Network, The Curious\nCase of Benjamin Button) handles the direction here, and Gillian Flynn\nwrote the no-holds-barred screenplay, based on her novel.<br><br>Overall, after an inauspicious start, the movie took some turns that\nreally captured my interest, and by the time it was over I was totally\n\"locked in\" and fascinated.\n"},

The\nDavid Fincher direction is very noticeable in the film and he has\nperfectly made another dark mystery, making it more effective with\nevery twist. Rosamund Pike, she very well gives the best performance of\nthe year for a female, also just acting in general. This woman knocks\nit out of the park and she embodies the twisted, insane darkness of Amy\nfrom the book.

{"review": "\nDavid Fincher has outdone himself with his cinematic adaptation of\nGillian Flynn's bestselling novel.

However when Amy\nvanishes without a trace to her whereabouts, police and residents\ndeduce that Nick has done away with Amy, but the truth is far stranger\nthan elaborate fiction. <br><br>Affleck is in top form as Nick, a man who had it all: a beautiful home,\na bar run by his smart mouth sister (Carrie Coon) and the ultimate\ntrophy wife, but when evidence points to him having possibly murdered\nAmy the viewer begins to despise him as his dirty little secrets begin\nto surface. <br><br>As the manipulative and scheming Amy, Rosamund Pike gives a bravado\nperformance that has netted her an Oscar nod for Best Actress.

At times we're with him, at others\nwith her. The plot has numerous weaknesses but generally carries itself\nquite well. I watched it and considered any number of ways the story\nwould end. Was he really the bad guy and she a poor mentally abused\nwife? Was she a crazed psychopath who would kill him in the dying\nembers of the film? And in the words of Docking, having prepared for\neverything I was not prepared for nothing! This film has the worst\n\"We've really run out of ideas\" ending in cinematic history.

{"review": "\nI finally got around to watching 'Gone Girl'. With all the hype, I\nfigured it might be worth watching. It wasn't. My opinion is that this\nmovie fails due to poor directing, awful acting, lousy continuity, lack\nof plausibility, zero suspense. The biggest issue was Ben Affleck. Come\non people, he can't act. He doesn't act. I believe he could be replaced\nwith a cardboard cutout. Rosamund Pike was little better, but that may\nhave been a direction issue. Kim Dickens and Carrie Coon were the only\ntwo that brought game. Spoiler Alert, in my opinion, watching this move\nwill spoil your day. The rest of this is just filler. It seems that\nIMDb thinks reviews have to be long and boring. \" Your review does not\ncontain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of\ntext. Please see the guidelines.

{"review": "\nI'm surprised at the viewer reviews of this movie. Every review I've\nseen for pages has been either a rating of 1 or a rating of 10 and I'm\namazed that what I considered a pretty mundane film is evoking such\nimpassioned opinions. The storyline of a wife framing her husband for\nher murder is a tale that has been told many times before (and often\ntold much better, imo). The plot was far-fetched with plenty of holes,\nas many reviewers have pointed out however, although I wasn't \"on the\nedge of my seat\", I was reasonably entertained. The antagonist was\ndefinitely despicable and I was rooting for Ben Affleck's flawed, yet\ngood, guy and his twin sister. All-in-all, I would sum it up as\nunremarkable - worth watching on video on a rainy night when you just\nwant to enjoy it for what it is without thinking too hard. If this\nmovie deserves a rating of 1 out of 10 (or for that matter 10 out of\n10) what do we have left for the truly awful (or truly masterful)\nmovies?\n"},
{"review": "\nThe more time passes since finishing \"Gone Girl\", the more the\naftertaste worsens. It did its job in keeping me guessing until the\nfinal credits, but with that bloated running time and those levels of\nhype, that can't be all it set out to do, right? Affleck and Pike are\nplaying such bland characters that I didn't care what happened to\neither of the Dunne party. I cared far more for Carrie Coon and Kim\nDickens, who were unquestionably side players. Neil Patrick Harris was\njust a plot device to get -SPOILER- Amy to return home and reveal that\nshe was alive.<br><br>Sure, Amy Dunne is a sociopath for the ages, but she's a terribly draw\ncharacter.

{"review": "\nThe acting and the script is so bad in this movie it almost seems like\nsome surreal dream, with so many twists and turns in such a drawn out\nmovie it just does too much and too little at the same time, however\nthat is possible I have no idea but it manages that, there's a lot of\nscenes this movie could do without and if you've seen it you'll\nprobably know which ones and not to mention the message that it puts\nacross. seems to be that there are very little good movies around these\ndays and we cannot even rely on established directors and producers for\na good film anymore. steer clear of this movie, it is Ben Afflek's\nworst performance to date and that is saying something!\n"},
{"review": "\nLacked drama and suspense. Why did she disappear? I asked myself \"what\nwas the whole point?\".

This movie was too\nlong, boring and annoying. I am so disappointed. Everyone recommended\nit and I can't see why... The only thing I can say is that Ben Affleck\nplayed a good role as a clueless and dumb husband. The character Amy\nhad nothing better to do. She was miserable and clearly insane. I\nstarted this review a little before the movie ended, it made me that\nbored. BORED! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, sorry.\n"},
{"review": "\nA long way into the movie I was thrilled, and couldn't wait to see what\nit would end with.

Rosamund Pike's\ncharacter i found very interesting, but it sounded like she was\nwhispering the entire movie really annoyed me.<br><br>As the movie came to towards the end, i just didn't get it. The plot\nhad been interesting for so long, and then ended crap. I would have\nloved to see some more twist to make me think more, instead if leaving\nme with the thought that I just wasted me time.<br><br>In real life, I really hope that the police wouldn't be so stupid. Why\nthe heck would anybody go to Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) fathers house to\nburn the diary? Which would take no time to burn, yet fails. But do\nhave the time to clean up the huge blood pool, that supposedly happened\nwhen Amy was kidnapped. And to assume Desi Collings (Neil Patrick)\nkidnapped her, how did he know about Nick Dunne's fathers house?!\nAnother thing that really annoyed me, was that Amy was sent home from\nthe hospital COVERED in blood.

{"review": "\nThis film wasn't as bad as some people say it was. It was actually\ngood. It was a pretty nice psycho thriller. It had me guessing at times\nand there really weren't any dull moments. This film was well done with\njust enough suspense to keep me interested. The acting in this film was\ngreat as well. Now, I'm not a big fan of Tyler Perry's films but his\nacting is good. He had a wonderful performance in this film playing\nTannor Bolt, Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) lawyer. He was really perfect\nfor the part. For me it was kind of weird seeing Neil Patrick Harris\nplaying a serious roll as the crazy ex boy friend of Nick Dunne's (Ben\nAffleck) wife, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). Rosamund Pike and the parts\nshe were in were well done! I mean she pulled that roll off! Amy Dunne\n(Rosamund Pike) was allegedly killed by her husband Nick Dunne (Ben\nAffleck).

Under pressure from the police and growing\nmedia frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble.\nSoon his lies, deceits, and strange behavior have everyone asking the\nsame dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife?

As they\npeel away layers of their story, a feeling of dread grows; it's like\npulling moldy leaves from an artichoke that is rotting from the inside\nout. With the close-knit psychological ambiance, the film paints\nAmerican middle class as a blood-curdling, emotional danger zone. It's\na testament to David Fincher's skill as a filmmaker that he makes\nsomething as complex as \"Gone Girl\" feel so effortless yet riddled with\npalpable suspense and spellbinding twists.<br><br>Couching its commentary in a propulsive pulp tale, \"Gone Girl\" is a\ngenre triumph - at once scary and deceptively sly. Dark, clever,\ntwisted, and stylish, this riveting thriller plays to director David\nFincher's sick strengths while bringing the best out of its female\nlead, Rosamund Pike.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie starts off very well with the murder of the hero's wife ,\nplayed by Rosamund pike , and builds up the story until halfway through\nwhen we find out she isn't dead..
