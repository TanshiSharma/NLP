{"review": "\nI just saw Shutter Island this evening, just prior to its American\nrelease. I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewing\nthis film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was\ngoing to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when\nwatching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average\nfilm-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought\nrequired. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and\ndefinitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who\nwas never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much\nrange to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is\nexcellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I\nalways enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and\nwhere the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer.\n"},
{"review": "\nReally, Scorsese should just give it away for anyone. The man is one of\nthe most brilliant directors of our time. Anyway, let me get to the\nactual movie; I just saw it at a early screening and have to write this\nwhile I'm thinking about how stunning it was. Shutter Island is\ncertainly not a typical film, not even for Scorsese. It is a different\ntake for the director, and he does it, as he does every film,\nperfectly, so much as to be in his own league of film-making. I don't\nwant to give anything away, but I will say this: Shutter Island was\ncompletely unexpected, and a great start to 2010. It had all the\ncomponents of a great film, and then some. The acting is spot on from\nevery character; none of it seems forged or out of place. The script is\nfantastic; it has one of the most intriguing plots I have seen in a\nwhile (exception being Tarantino's Basterds). Everything, down to the\nset's lighting, was perfectly executed. I will say that not everyone\nwill like this; Shutter Island, again, isn't your typical movie. To\nthose, though, who do choose to see this film, be ready for a\ncompelling, gripping, thought-provoking experience, so much so that you\nmight think to see it again for further clarity (I know I will; it was\nso entertaining and my mind was blown!). Don't be surprised if you see\nthis at the next Oscars...\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this and I knew what to expect going in to the film as I had\nalready read about half of the book but never got the chance to finish\nit. But I was surprised at how faithful the film was to the original\nmaterial.The directing was also masterfully done and pretty cool I saw\nsome cool camera tricks I hadn't seen since Martin Scorsese directed\nBringing Out The Dead, Martin Scorsese did one great job and everyone\nwas top notch especially Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio and I never though I\nwould jump out of fright especially in a Scorsese film but I did. All\nin all a solid thriller with a good story and some great performances\nand for me it's the best film I've seen in 2010 so far.\n"},
{"review": "\nMartin Scorsese has done it again. He pays attention to every detail in\nthis film, making \"Shutter Island\" one of the best suspense thrillers\nof all time.<br><br>Visually intriguing, simplistic and absolutely phenomenal. The story is\nkept simplistic enough so it doesn't get absurd, but allows for an\nending which you probably won't see coming. The film doesn't go for\ncheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you\nwon't get needlessly scared.<br><br>The film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to\ndetailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely\nengross you in the film. I loved every minute of it and highly\nrecommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a usual fan of the genre,\nthis film has so much more to it.\n"},
{"review": "\nMartin Scorsese returns to film making after winning the academy award\nfor The Departed with his fav star Leonardo DiCaprio.. This time he\nmove to a completely different script which keeps the audience humored\nand thrilled from the first scene till the last!

{"review": "\nFirst, I know many who read this will not take the time to research\nwhat I'm saying to see that it is true and further, many won't have the\nability to see it even if they did. So, I know this review will be\nthumbed down by those who don't like the hard truths in life but this\nmovie (or should I say novel by Dennis Lehane) was a nice piece of\nplagiarism based upon a 1920 silent film called The Cabinet of Dr.\nCaligari.<br><br>The same basic plot exists in both as well as the exact same twist\nending. The lead character investigates an insane asylum and tries to\nput clues together to figure out the mystery surrounding the place but\nas we near the end, we learn that the lead character isn't there to\ninvestigate anything. He's an inmate there who has invented much of\nwhat he was investigating as part of his coping mechanism.<br><br>Shutter Island would have been a good movie if it hadn't ripped off The\nCabinet of Dr. Caligari so blatantly. Lehane obviously knew that the\nold movie was in the public domain but instead of telling the viewers\nthat it was based on that movie, they just pass it off as his (and/or\nScorseesi's idea). That, my friends, is the definition of plagiarism.<br><br>I don't recommend this whatsoever for this reason. It is a shame and\nLehane should be called on it but who will do it? Too much $ to be made\nreheating the old dishes and calling them made from scratch.<br><br>Watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (it's on y o u t u b e if you want to\ncompare the two and see that what I'm saying is 100% correct).<br><br>I almost never write reviews but this time, I had to.\n"},
{"review": "\nI hate to say this as much anyone else but for me this film had a\nhorribly disappoint ending. First before I delve into that I'd like to\nsay that the acting, the writing, the shooting, the film in general as\nfar as quality goes was very good. But the ending was very\ndisappointing. And no I am no idiot or newbie when it comes to film.\nBut I thought the was very much a cop out. Now granted I know this is\nbased off of a novel, hence there are certain restraints to adhering to\nthis novel somewhat. That being said I found the idea of the medical\nexperimentation, mental hospital, nazi experiments, and astray patients\nmuch more tantalizing, realistic, and more full of potential. The trick\nending where its all in someone's head is done far too often sadly. I\nwas hoping that while it dragged one there at the end it would\nultimately reveal he was playing them or that he would stay true and\nnot give in. But that didn't happen. I guess for me I was just\nexpecting something not so clich\u00e9 for an ending from the likes of\nScorsese's genius mind. But all things said and done I definitely can't\ngive this movie all negative remarks, wonderfully acted and scripted.\nGreat atmosphere, shooting, photography, etc. But I feel the ending\nshould have been less clich\u00e9 or not as cheap I guess. Felt like it was\njust an easy way out and not fully developing the tension and intrigue\nthat they had built throughout. But either way its each to their own,\nso maybe you will appreciate the ending more than I. FYI - I do\nunderstand the undertones of the ending and the ambiguity, but I don't\nthink that saves the ending or does the film justice in it's entirety.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis review DOES contain spoilers.<br><br>Right at the beginning of the film it becomes clear that this is\nsupposed to be all spooky and scary. The movie tries too hard at\ncreating an eerie mood, and fails miserably because it is so overdone,\nespecially with the music. There are a few good scenes but most of it\nis repeated so many times it becomes tedious. The observant viewer will\nquickly understand (spoiler here) that the US Marshal actually is a\npatient there, and from there on in you just wait for him to \"get it\",\nand you no longer care about anyone or anything that happens. And the\nshocking twist at the end is no twist, its just a boring \"yeah, yeah,\nwe get it\"-moment. Of course he's on his way to get the lobotomy, yeah\nso he's not cured, maybe he chose not to be cured, blah blah blah, \"the\nending leaves so many questions\" yeah whatever.<br><br>It's too overdone, too obvious, too long and too boring.

The\nopening scene was great, but then it went downhill from there\u0085 <br><br>THE BAD: Whoever wrote this film should be ashamed. There was no\noriginality to this plot whatsoever, and the overacting almost made\nthis film unbearable. The ending was so frustrating that I wondered if\nI actually missed something. I kept waiting for the movie to get\nbetter, but it never did. I just kept thinking that this couldn't have\nbeen one of those \"it was all a dream\" clich\u00e9s, but sadly it was.

{"review": "\nSpoilers ahead, although not really, since none of the movie you watch\nwill be relevant to the ending.<br><br>Let's break it down simply. The whole movie is a two hour long,\ntwilight zone style \"and then he woke up.\" Everything you watch, all of\nthe characters, all of the story, mean nothing. They are erased at the\nending when the protagonist \"comes to\" and realizes that he's just a\nmurderer. But keep in mind, this isn't any normal crime. It is at once\nas clich\u00e9 and as over the top as possible.<br><br>In the meantime, heir director made no attempt to do any serious\nresearch into psychology at all, even its history. At the end you're\nwatching a literal, rational, \"bargain\" being made between the\npsychologists and the protagonist, despite the fact that at the outset\nof the film they point out that the insane are not so easily \"reasoned\"\nwith, that they don't respond to stimuli in \"rational\" ways.<br><br>In short, the whole movie is a textbook case of failure in the art of\nstory telling. I wish I could be less harsh, but I've been reading IMDb\nfor years now, and this was the first time I felt the need to register\nto expose a film. If you really liked this film, then you don't\nunderstand story telling at all, and you have no taste. You can whine\nabout it all being a matter of opinion if you want, but a story that in\nits climax obliterates the hour and a half you took to get there is no\nstory at all.\n"},

{"review": "\nOooo! it's Scorsese! and The Caprio, and Ben \"Gandhi\" Kingsley. Let's\nstart the praise, the \"masterpiece litany\"!!!! The film is presented\nthis way (the quote is from a review at IMDb's): SHUTTER ISLAND is the\nstory of two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, who are\nsummoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts\nto investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the\nisland's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane. Try now to\nbelieve it. As the aim of the movie is to deny what you have just read.\nSo what's the point? I can introduce Alice in wonderland like \"it is\nthe story of a Chinese manufacturer who is hired by a mysterious\nunderground tea dealer. Eventually she has to confront the mischievous\nqueen of Tibet to defend a bunch of rabbits\". Shutter Island is a bad\nmovie. Everything is built on a \"twist\" which is clear since the very\nbeginning. In-depth explanation involving fire and water dichotomy\n(some review at IMDb's) must come from patient 64. There are a couple\nof nice shots (nice doesn't necessarily mean \"beautiful\"), but there\nare a lot of flaws in the \"story\", boring clich\u00e9s, incongruences,\nunexplainable behaviour even for an asylum... and the more you try to\nsum up things, the worst it looks.\n"},

{"review": "\nI'll start by saying that I did enjoy this film overall but there are a\nlot of really annoying aspects to it. First off is DiCaprio's stubble,\nwhich in 1954 would have made him a vagrant, not a US Marshall. Then\nthere was the ridiculous music that accompanied an inconsequential\nscene of the marshals entering the asylum gates for the first time. It\nbuilt up and built up, then nothing happened. That kind of thing is\nreally annoying. The score overall veered from terrific to grating and\ninappropriate in places. I often found it quite distracting. There were\nmany continuity problems throughout. If it was meant to add another\ndimension to the film, it failed. Instead it was distracting and gave\nthe impression that they ran out of time/budget more than anything\nelse. The plot is largely obvious from early on. If it takes you more\nthan 15 minutes to work out what is going on, there is something wrong\nwith you. OK, the full extent of the revelations at the end is harder\nto divine before it's revealed but the thrust of it is obvious. The\nfilm was, as you'd expect, beautifully shot and the cast was pretty\ngood, although DiCaprio's Boston accent came and went at different\ntimes. The setting was also magnificent, which added to the overall\neffect. As a genre film, Shutter Island doesn't work nearly as well as\nothers. Identity comes to mind as a far better attempt at the same kind\nof story. It's probable that it's strength is that it is not really a\ngenre film and will, therefore, appeal to a broader audience.

What was needed was\nsomeone to physically embody the emotional turmoil the character had\nendured. And the flashbacks only make the intelligent viewer ask the\nobvious question, which is, why should we care so much about this one\nperson's troubles when all those people were killed by the Nazis (or\nsurvived with their horrible memories)? That was an idiotic thing to\ninclude in this film, totally undermining it. Scorsese tried to do way\ntoo much here. He could've tried to do a \"modern\" version of \"The\nCabinet of Dr. Caligari,\" for example. Then ending also didn't make\nsense to me, and was almost an endorsement of suicide, though\nconsidering how this impressed me as \"career suicide,\" perhaps it makes\nsome sort of ironic sense.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am disappointed with this movie. When you have Martin Scorsese behind\nthe camera , Leonardo DiCaprio in the starring role and some\ninteresting source material , you would expect an intelligent ,\nthought-provoking film. Unfortunately, the team behind 'Shutter Island'\nhave let this assumption go to their heads and as a result their\n'intricately-woven thriller' (?!?) is in reality too predictable and\ntoo equivocal to be worth watching.<br><br>The story revolves around detective Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) who is\ncalled to investigate the disappearance of a woman from a mysterious\nIsland prison/asylum - home of the insane. It certainly begins well ,\nwith grim cinematography and ominous music , making the film appear\nvery formidable. Unfortunately , the movie then embarks on a trail of\nmany twists and turns , which were actually rather foreseeable.\nMoreover, the movie over-complicates itself through weird\nhallucinations that aren't necessary to the story. Ben Kingsley is good\nin his role, as are DiCaprio and Ruffalo but they cannot help this\nmovie as they are simply puppets of this mindless screenplay. I\nactually liked the ambiguous ending but honestly it just emphasised how\nunclear the writers were on how to wrap this up.<br><br>The tag line to this movie is 'someone's missing'. That someone is\nclearly a writer with any sense.

Scorcese is well-documented as both loving\nand being an expert on movies so it is almost certain that he is\nfamiliar with The Shawshank Syndrome and it is equally certain that he\nhas, to some extent, remade it with a Shylamanesque twist, if you\nrecall, was a catalyst surrounded by sad people who needed 1) a nudge\nto bring them together or 2) some form of healing. DiCappio is also a\ncatalyst surrounded by people who need help getting together - and\nhealing - Ben Kingsley. Viewed in these terms it can be said that both\ncatalysts succeed admirably but, it has to be said, when is a rip-off\nnot a rip-off? possibly when it's a sacred cow doing the ripping-off.<br><br>The 3D is used effectively and Von Snydow supplies the best\nperformance, counteracting the film's worst performance by Ben\nKingsley.

{"review": "\nOnce director Martin Scorsese attained widespread acceptance from\nmoviegoers (and mainstream critics) with the massive commercial success\nof \"Cape Fear\" in 1991, he quickly turned into a 'blockbuster'\nfilmmaker, one who had his pick of top-rank collaborators. The Scorsese\nname became a brand--like Spielberg's--however, the movies he has\nchosen to work on since do not always echo the interests of the young,\nraw Scorsese. With \"Shutter Island\", an adaptation of a novel by Dennis\nLehane, the stamp of Scorsese becomes interchangeable with that of\nShyamalan, De Palma, Polanski...even the ghost of Stanley Kubrick,\nwhose \"The Shining\" seems to be an inspirational starting point for\nthis thin, shuddery yarn. Leonard DiCaprio plays a U.S. Federal Marshal\nin 1954 investigating the disappearance of a female mental patient from\na locked-down asylum in the Boston Harbor. Elements of other films keep\nturning up in Laeta Kalogridis' poor script, which incorporates (at\nvarious intervals) concentration camp detail with a triple homicide\nthat is both exploitative and distasteful. The large cast is solid, for\nthe most part--Scorsese has retained his uncanny ability to bring out\nthe best in his actors--though I'm not sure how deeply DiCaprio is\nfeeling his role. His frequent scowl doesn't reveal anything but a\npetulant nature, which, coupled with his youthful appearance, doesn't\nlend much conviction to a character who is alternately a soldier, a\nfamily man, and a government employee. DiCaprio is making a career out\nof seeming miscast; since this entire house-of-cards plot rests on the\nstar's shoulders, the final denouement isn't the heart-breaker it\nshould have been. The picture is vividly atmospheric and features\nexcellent technical detail, yet it is a glum undertaking burdened with\noverwrought profanities ill-suited to the era.

{"review": "\nShutter Island. I'm going to tell about this interesting film and\nexpress own feelings.

Mystical\nhospital on the island has many puzzles and you begin to ask different\nquestions yourselves. Then, play of the main character is so real and\nhis searching for mystical truth excites all the time. I think that the\nmain part of a good film for people is their interest in it. And you\ncan't fall asleep after watching a Shatter Island. Illness or\nconviction? When I saw it once, I believed that we have a deal with an\nillness weirdo because strange lighthouse prove a simple one without\nany secrets, and awful experiments like he earlier imaged are not\nexist. However for the second watching, I understood that he is\nconvinced. Secret pills, cigarettes, woman's note \"run out\" and a\nfascinating logic intellect can't belong to a crazy man. May be...\nWell, I was surprised after culmination. Who could imagine the end like\nthis? I think none of us. We amazed by this plot, idea and then we\nbegin to adore this film. This is an achievement of a director and\nfantasy which reflect interesting motions in Teddy's head. The secret\nof successful film- surprise, shock and our wish to see it one more\ntime exactly with the same actors. People want to find some new, fresh\nand unusual belong boring and not good movies. And if you a person like\nthis, you need watch Shutter Island. In conclusion, I'd want to say\nthat we must watch films like one in order to being surprised and\nexited about opportunities of our mind. We must have wide open eyes on\nour usual world:)\n"},

{"review": "\n'Shutter Island' is a Martin Scorsese film about a federal officer,\nplayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, who visits a high-security hospital for\nthe criminally insane, and this facility is located on a remote island.\nThis setting immediately establishes a feeling of bleakness, isolation\nand dystopia, which amplifies greatly as 'Shutter Island' progresses. I\nthink that Scorsese's maintenance of the grim atmosphere is one of the\nstrongest qualities of the film, but this hard exterior belies the\nhollow psychology of 'Shutter Island'. The dark exploration of the mind\ndoesn't hold a candle to 'Taxi Driver', nor do the twists live up to\n'The Departed'. I felt as though the portrayal of insanity in 'Shutter\nIsland' was a little too cartoonlike, seeming to resemble something\nyou'd find in Gotham City. This discredits the film, in my opinion, and\nmakes 'Shutter Island' feel very hollow and superficial at times. There\nare one or two satisfying twists throughout the film, but I don't think\nthat they sufficiently compensate for the tedium of the first half.\nDiCaprio's objectives in the film seem ambiguous at times, and,\ncombined with the barrage of flashbacks and hallucinations, 'Shutter\nIsland' often feels like a video game played inattentively. The film\nisn't a disaster, though, as the editing is very enjoyable at times,\nand Scorsese's creation of the cold, dystopian landscape has to be\ncommended. I just wish that this film was a little more 'One Flew Over\nthe Cuckoo's Nest' or 'The Silence of the Lambs', and a little less\n'Batman: Arkham Asylum'.\n"},

The fantasy part is half-baked with some clumsy clues, and\nthen we get memories of the holocaust to illuminate the hero's past.\nWas that really necessary? I was thinking Jacob's Ladder, but I didn't\nlike that either and it was a better movie than this.<br><br>The figuring-out part is like an '80s Hercules Poirot episode - neither\nscary nor emotive, just flipping over the cards as it suits the dealer.\nOn top of his holocaust experience, the hero also had a mad homicidal\nwife.

Not only is the insanity plot much more interesting, the\nfilm becomes much more interesting once you watch it from this premise.\nFor example, the warden who drives Teddy back from the cliffs, who\nisn't buying into the doctors' tactics and gives him the \"you're\ndangerous and violent\" comments: great scene, but merely weird if you\nhaven't suspected the context.

One last note on\nthe history of psychiatry: the struggle between psychosurgery and\nmodern psychiatry devoted to the phenomenology of the patient's\nnarrative - that is a true fact, and it did begin in the fifties.\nFurthermore, going along with a patient's delusion at crtain points of\nthe therapeutic process: I'm appalled that many reviewers found this so\nabsurd.

{"review": "\nGrowing up I used to see Scorsese as magic. And he is only a director\nwho had the chance, and maybe some inspiration, to choose the box\noffice hits from all the projects he received. In the case of Shutter\nIsland, is the script that does the magic. Scorsese just directs people\naccording to the given script. DiCaprio? Well, it would have been much\nbetter if he could act. But, as usual, Leo DiCaprio only moves around\nthe set with a blank expression. Like any puppet he moves around, she\ncan open the mouth and tell the lines and that is about it. Actually,\nthanks to the demigod director, most actors are in the same state and\nunless for the realism, one might think this is an animation project.\nMax von Sydow is the only one acting, but that is maybe because he is\ntoo old to be directed by the mighty Scorsese. And the role is small.<br><br>It is also interesting to see the transformation of Scorsese in the\nlight of his exposure to the Asian film makers. He is trying color\nfilters and enhancers. It would have been nice to have these variations\nback in the days of Goodfellas. Still, it is only an experiment and it\nlooks like one as the color variations are cute, but add nothing to the\nstory itself.<br><br>So I have enjoyed the script and not much else.\n"},

DiCaprio and Ruffalo do an amazing job. Like in most their\nmovies, you feel the characters and go on a literal and mental journey\nwith them. This is a film that may at times appear slow if you do not\nget into it. You must be paying attention to detail and attempting to\nunderstand all the characters are trying to tell you.

{"review": "\nIt's always a delight to see directors have a variety of genres in\ntheir careers that's one of the reasons a love Shutter Island so much\nit's something completely different from Scorsese.

This became apparent in the dream sequences as they\ncould have come across as pretentious and melodramatic but they fit in\nperfectly.This is definitely a movie that's best experienced knowing as\nlittle as possible because this first and foremost is an investigation\nmovie and you want to be able to experience that investigation with the\ncharacters. Leonardo DiCaprio returns for his fourth collaboration with\nMartin Scorsese and he is fantastic in this movie not only is he a\ncharacter the audience can get behind he is also very complex and makes\nsure DiCaprio can give it everything. Mark Ruffalo was also very good\nin this movie he was likable and subtle. Ben Kingsley isn't in the\nmovie much but he definitely makes the most of that screen time.

This was supposed to be Scorsese's\nexperiment in B-movie thrills, but no mere B-movie director would go on\nfor two hours and 20 minutes.
