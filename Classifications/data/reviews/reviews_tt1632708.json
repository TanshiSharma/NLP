{"review": "\nI was able to see a sneak screening of this movie almost 1 month prior\nto it's official release. I honestly walked in simply thinking I was\nseeing another typical romantic comedy with my girlfriend. To my\nsurprise it was much more.<br><br>Timberlake plays an LA Blog Art Director who has just been recruited to\nwork for GQ in New York by Kunis who is a headhunter. The two had great\nchemistry through out the movie.<br><br>What's funny is that even though it does contain the usual Clich\u00e9\nscenes that most romantic adult comedies contain, it does tend to poke\nfun at them and have some sort of realism to the plot.<br><br>Both Timberlake and Kunis are likable and really funny. Woody Harrelson\nwas the best addition to support this younger cast. Harrelson plays a\nflamboyantly gay sports editor who goes from making sexual advances to\nJT, to offering him some pearls of wisdom with his love life.<br><br>I would have to say this movie was very enjoyable and if your skeptical\nabout seeing it in the theaters, definitely put it on your \"must rent\"\nlist.\n"},

Timberlake and Kunis have a lot of chemistry\non camera ... It's shot primarily in new york so expect the clich\u00e9d new\nyork locations ... <br><br>The complexity of Timberlake's character is slowly revealed through the\nshow as opposed to being revealed in the first 3 minutes like most\nother movies.<br><br>A good watch ... not slap your knee funny but certainly entertaining to\nthe end ... clich\u00e9s and all\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was all things clich\u00e9 and predictable. Even though you know\nwhat is coming, the honesty with life's little quirks and human\nbehavior was incredibly well done. <br><br>Timberlake is an okay actor. I found him to be a fresh breath in this\nmovie. The dialogue and scenario fit his charm quite well. <br><br>I found Mila Kunis to be quite funny, and she pulled off that cute,\ncharming, awkwardly damaged woman, perfectly. She was chic, yet easy to\nrelate too. Down to earth, but an air of success and confidence, hidden\nin all the girly dreams and fairy-tales. <br><br>If you want something original and never done before, this is the wrong\nmovie to watch. If you wish to appreciate a good spin on an old concept\nwith stellar humor and humanity, it is worth the watch..\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Friends with Benefits\" has a predictable and unoriginal rom-com\nstoryline and its ending is pretty lame. Yet this movie coasts on the\ncharisma of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis and a lot of sharp and\nwitty dialogue. As long as these two actors are talking to each other\nor having sex, there is hardly ever a dull moment. And the reason for\nthis seems to be simple enough. In most rom-coms, the actors play\npretty dim-witted, boring and superficial people and therefore there is\nno reason to take interest in anything they may say or do. In this\nrom-com, \"Friends with Benefits,\" Timberlake and Kunis play fresh,\nindependent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in\nthe lives they lead and what they say to each other. So \"Friends with\nBenefits\" does not have much of a plot, but that does seem to matter\nbecause on this rare occasion we are happily distracted by the\nmagnetism of two capable on screen actors who are playing two\nwell-craft parts.\n"},

Honestly,\nTimberlake surprised me a bit with his performance.<br><br>Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 6* - There is a lot of great\nscenery of LA and New York in the film. The movie also has a great\npace, which can be attributed to the directing.<br><br>Plot/Characters: 6* - Nothing new in the storyline with this movie, but\nit is done fairly well. Guy and girl are friends and decide to have no\nstrings attached sex, but of course that is hard to do.<br><br>Entertainment Value: 7* - As mentioned, this movie is appealing to both\ngenders and is fast paced and entertaining.

This movie didn't even have the bright\nside of good actors, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis may be easy on\nthe eye but are mediocre actors at best, you only have to watch MK in\nOz: The Great And Powerful to see what I mean. It's just so boring and\npredictable and as the movie goes on it gets more and more cheesy.

{"review": "\nWhat a waste of time. Same boring script we've seen time and time\nagain. Might have been a better movie if Timberlake and Harrelson\nexchanged roles. Horrible. Way overboard with the sexual situations and\nlanguage. Couple of narcissistic persons with a complete lack of\nmorality try to hook up. You know every move before it happens. I\nwonder if they have run out of ideas in Hollywood. The background music\nwas way too distracting. I wasn't sure if they were showing a movie or\npromoting a music CD. Timberlake is completely unbelievable in his\nrole. I thought I was watching \"That Seventies Show\" with the cast they\nhad. Forget this one and rent another movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was actually embarrassed for the headline actors, Justin Timberlake\nand Mila Kunis. The material was not good nor were the jokes. Justin\nTimberlake was bad enough to begin, as usual. Mila Kunis is normally\nbetter than this. I guess she was playing down to her material and\nco-star. Either way the acting was horrible as was the plot and the\ndirection. A negative trifecta. If there were any redeeming factors to\nthe film it was the supporting actors. All of which I felt did an\nexcellent job with the material they had to work. Patricia Clarkson,\nWoody Harrelson, Richard Jenkins and even Jenna Elfman, respectively.\nThe film was predictable which is OK in this genre. Just a sloppy\nproject in every facet. Save your time and bypass this one.\n"},

{"review": "\nDon't waste your time on this one. A weak, predictable plot highly\ndependent on simulated sex scenes between the two main characters to\nmaintain viewer interest. Of course, if you're into that kind of thing,\nyou'd probably think this was the movie of the year. If you're looking\nfor some depth or acting quality, you've come to the wrong film.<br><br>And what's with Justin Timberlake? Is he gay or putting a little too\nmuch glitter on his speech to give it a gay twist? I'm not trying to be\nfunny here because one of the running gags is that people keep asking\nhim if he is gay. I suppose this is supposed to have us all convulsed\nwith laughter, otherwise I don't have any idea why they are beating us\nto death with this angle. I suspect Mila Kunis did her best with the\nunderdeveloped character she was given, and its the reason I rated the\nfilm so highly.

{"review": "\nThis was a very 21st century movie. It seemed like it was trying too\nhard to avoid being clich\u00e9, but it just ended up being clich\u00e9 with a\ntwist.

The good thing about this movie that stands out\nagainst the rest of its kind is that there's more to it than the title\nimplies. Most people have to learn the hard way in life; few save\nthemselves in time. The ending credits were so much fun that I had to\nsit until the very end. They did a great job on this movie.

And that he will be around for a long time with the right kind\nof roles he is playing.<br><br>His character and Mila Kunis character are dumped in the form of Emma\nStone and Andy Samberg respectively. As Kunis character is NY based and\nTimberlake's character is LA based. As both at first hit it off.<br><br>Timberlake is trying to land a job. With Kunis as his guide. But they\nhave sexual tension too hot to bear. But the catch is they want to\nremain friends, and nothing beyond that.<br><br>Well easier said than done! As it seems to be the case. Can they remain\nthat way without having their sexual desires get in the way? Really\nfunny and both actors have chemistry!\n"},
{"review": "\nA film which should suit any age. Romance and comedy which is the\nperfect combination. Most people in live have attempted to have a\nfriend with benefit, and this film tells you why its difficult to keep\nit. With the sexy actor Justin Timberlake and beautiful Mila Kunis, you\nwatch two people who start of having a bit of fun, end up falling for\neach other. It's not all about the sex, a part of Dylan's (Timberlake)\nlive has a secret which can relate to those who are also struggling\nwith someone Alzheimer's. I loved the film and it suits anyone weather\nor not you haven't had a friend with benefit as it just makes you laugh\nthroughout. All my friends have loved this film as it relates to\neveryone so you should watch it too, I highly recommend it.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film is about a top magazine executive and a beautiful headhunter\nbeing best friends, with added benefits of being purely physical\nwithout being emotional.<br><br>\"Friends with Benefits\" looks promising in the beginning. It's fast\npaced and does not drag around. It has loads of eye candies from the\ntwo attractive leads. However, things start to deteriorate in the\nmiddle of the film. It descends into being just another forgettably\nformulaic romantic comedy. It drags on and on, trying to get serious\nwith the emotional side and worst of all it delivers no eye candy. I\njust got bored. Woody Harrelson's attempt of acting a gay character is\nnot so convincing either. I keep thinking that it is a role perfect for\nStanley Tucci.\n"},

{"review": "\nIMDb had a 6.7 rating for this movie which is usually represents a\nmovie worthy of watching at least once, so I decided to give this a\nshot even though I don't care for JT or his acting at all. Huge\nmistake. The movie was raunchy and totally predictable, it wasn't the\nleast bit funny, and there was no chemistry at all between the lead\nactors (due in part to the fact that JT doesn't talk or act like a\nheterosexual).<br><br>Seriously, is this what passes for a romantic comedy nowadays?. I\nwanted to kick myself for wasting 2 hours watching this garbage, when I\nwould've MUCH rather watched When Harry Met Sally for the 7th or 8th\ntime. But hey, if you liked Forgetting Sarah Marshall (garbage), or\nGood Luck Chuck (garbage except for Jessica Alba in itty bitty Penguin\nunderwear ;)), then maybe this movie is for you. A word to the wise\nthough, don't watch it with your children, regardless of age.\n"},
{"review": "\nI thought this movie was really good fun and found myself giggling a\nlot while watching it. Especially all the lines relating to multimedia\ntrends, 2011 lifestyle and all that hit right home and were really\nwitty (\"Bible App\"...).<br><br>Timberlake and Kunis have a very good chemistry together and a\nscrewball comedy feel to them. Justin will somehow always be the little\nguy from N'Sync to me, but he managed to parody himself by singing at\nall occasion during this movie. And ... not a bad actor, no.<br><br>Okay, it was crystal clear where the plot was heading, when Justin and\nMila met at the Airport, but still enjoyable and fun movie and one of\nthe better romcoms I'd say.\n"},
{"review": "\nI want to start by saying that this movie has nothing to do with the\nmovie No Strings Attached even though the plot has some similarities\nit's way better.<br><br>First the script was wonderful written and cinematography i have to say\nwas quite great and thats because cinematographer Michael Grady choose\nsome great lovely,romantic places of New York to shoot the film.<br><br>And also Justin Timberlake for me it was just the right guy for the\nrole because of his young looking fresh style.But we can't forget Mila\nKunis who she was perfect playing that emotonialy damaged girl and also\nher out of the teeth manners and her bizarre sexieness really makes you\nlove the characters and the movie of course.<br><br>So,if you like to see a young fresh comedy i'll recommend this movie\nfor sure.\n"},
{"review": "\nSexy, smart, and hilarious, FWB is a great romantic comedy for adults!\nThis outrageous film staring the spunky and beautiful Mila Kunis and\nJustin Timberlake will have you smiling throughout the whole movie! It\ngives you all of what a romantic comedy would. Even though it is the\nsame old \"romantic/comedy\" genre it is still enjoyable to watch! FWB\nreally defines true love as well, it teaches you a valuable lesson,\ndon't ever lose your first love! The whole concept of the movie is very\nrelated to a lot of people! Of you love those romantic comedies that\nmake you laugh and cry as well, FWB is the way to go! Even though,\n(like all romantic comedies), it gets serious at the end, it is still a\ngood film to watch! FWB is the way to go if you are craving for a good\nromantic comedy that you haven't seen in a while!\n"},
{"review": "\nBoth Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake do fine jobs and their chemistry\nand timing carries the movie. Their back and forth banter is delightful\nand both of their characters are genuinely likable. We all know where\nthe plot is heading but somehow they manage to deliver an intelligent\nand fresh take on the concept. Unlike so many of these type of films\nand comedies, both leads feel real and are normal people. The\nsupporting cast is great except for Woody Harrelson's character who\nliterally can't go 2 seconds without remind everyone he's gay and/or\nbeing obnoxious to the max. Overall, this is a surprisingly strong\neffort with heart. Plus, Mila sexes up the screen in the most pleasant\nof ways even though there is no nudity.\n"},
{"review": "\nHmmm...so, I had hopes for this one. Justin and Mila are both hot and\nthey have great chemistry...when they're not on screen. <br><br>I actually liked \"No Strings Attached\" more, though not by much more,\nbut it was more believable. A better movie, in my opinion, is actually\n\"Love &amp; Other Drugs\" which I thought would be like watching a poodle\ncrap through a window while I eat my lunch. However, it surprised me.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, the movie was fun...but it got caught in that last\nweek's Velveeta (not even respectable cheese) crap.<br><br>See this movie if you:<br><br>1. Genuinely want to compare it with \"No Strings Attached\"<br><br>2. Can appreciate the long-term benefit in seeing Mila Kunis exposed<br><br>3. Really don't want a relationship with the guy you're dating<br><br>Also men...avoid this movie like the plague if the girl you're hoping\nto sleep with imposes a \"5-Date Rule\" on you. Let her watch it after\nyou've made it to date 5 and then stop calling her.<br><br>(5/10 stars) Self-Stimulation has more benefits, but this'll do.\n"},
{"review": "\nthis film was magnificent. after first reading the reviews on IMDb i\nwas skeptical upon going down to my local movie theater to watch this\nbut i am so glad i did for starters i have only seen justin timberlake\nin bad teacher and i didn't think he played much of a good role there.\nmila kunis however i have seen her in forgetting sarah marshill and she\nis one of the most beautiful actress in the world and on screen these\ntoo main actors make a very convincing story.<br><br>friends with benefits is a sexy funny and an all together good romantic\ncomedy i think the film should of focused more on there relationship\nwith each other towards the end and maybe that could of been slightly\nbetter because you don't want the film to end but all together 9.5/10\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie was entirely predictable since it was, after all, a formulaic\nchick flick (Boy meets girl, good moments, bad moments, almost break up\nand then patch up leading to Happily ever after). But it was funny at\ntimes and had some poignant moments thrown in for good measure. Justin\nTimberlake, though he's getting typecast in fast talking smooth\noperator type roles, was good. Mila Kunis was better and they had\npretty nice chemistry together. I like how they broke couple of\nstereotypes (art director, sports editor, who was probably the\nfunniest, BTW). Her mom's character was funny as well. It won't stick\nwith you, but it won't bore you while you're in there either. Good one\nto watch w/ your SO. <br><br>6/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI went to the movie with no expectations, and was thoroughly\nentertained. A laugh riot from the get go! A very funny movie that\ndeals with dating, friends, relationships, and sex.<br><br>The audience broke into laughter several times throughout the\nmovie--clearly bits and pieces of the movie resonated with one and all.<br><br>Performances by the actors was great--there was spontaneity, chemistry,\nand awesome screen presence. And of course, NYC is at its best. One\ncannot help but fall in love with the characters as they walk in\nCentral Park or gush through Times Square.<br><br>It is a light hearted movie that makes you feel good about life!\n"},
{"review": "\nBefore to go, thought it was a cheesy movie and was not really \r\ninterested since the trailer is not good at all and doesn't really \r\nbrought out how funny the movie is since it promotes a regular topic. \r\nBut, Still gave it a chance and just came back and i was not \r\ndisappointed at all. It was really funny and i really enjoyed this \r\nmovie, laugh a lot and enjoyed it for the jokes and how reality kicks \r\nin.\r\n\r\nI think the advertisement was of bad quality and don't show the quality \r\nof the movie and i misleading.\r\n\r\nOverall the movie was really good and funny. Also i love Mila Kunis but \r\nthought that Timberlake would be a joke but he was really good as well. \r\nWorth watching !!!

{"review": "\nThis is an unconscionably smug movie. Smug characters. Smug tone. Smug\nsubject matter, and smug condescension towards its audience. It's\ninfatuated with its own cleverness, staring adoringly at the rampant\ncynicism that propels it. Certainly, there's nothing wrong with\ncynicism, but every single character seems like an annoying caricature.\nAfter the first hour, it really starts to grate on the nerves. Sure,\nthe leads are pleasant to look at for each of the sexes but Milia's\npart is all tease for the viewer. It's a sex comedy without the T &amp; A\npayoff and that only adds to the frustration and my contempt for this\nhorrible horrible movie going experience. No one else needs waste money\non this film to experience what I had to endure.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had the opportunity to go see this movie as a sneak preview, and I\nmust say that I was pleasantly surprised.

{"review": "\nI LOVED this movie! Saw a free preview of it last night and was\npleasantly surprised. I was not expecting much because I'm not a huge\nfan of Justin's but it turned out great and Mila was perfect and\ngorgeous! Very sarcastic, funny, and reminded me of some friends of\nmine. I laughed the whole way through! Only a couple of small corny\nparts that slightly threw it off but you had to expect it because it's\na chic flick. I would actually pay to see this again! I tie it with the\nmovie The Ugly Truth. Wish they had more of Mila's mom and Justin's gay\ncoworker and the ending could have been more like the movie-\nchill/funny/not so mushy. Also, the sexy scenes could have been a\nlittle more... sexxxy ;)\n"}
