{"review": "\nI thoroughly enjoyed Chappie. I usually don't write reviews, but after\nseeing the brutal rating this movie is getting I felt compelled to\nwrite this review.<br><br>Chappie is a funny, entertaining, and surprisingly sentimental movie\nabout a sentient robot being raised by gangsters in Johannesburg. Most\nof the criticisms I've seen about one- dimensional characters and\nillogical character choices are valid, but Chappie's character, the\nCGI, the humor, and the overall aesthetic of the movie more than make\nup for these shortcomings.<br><br>Please go see this movie and make up your own mind. I almost didn't go\nlast night because of the negative reviews, but I'm so happy I did. I'm\nvery excited to see this movie again. You leave this movie feeling like\nyou've become friends with Chappie, and I hope the bad reviews don't\nprevent the sequels from being made.<br><br>If you like Neill Blomkamp's directing and style you will love this\nmovie.\n"},
{"review": "\nDon't let the critics who can't seem to get past comparing Chappie with\nother sci-fi titles put you off of going to see this film. <br><br>This story is about a lot more than just robot police officers it is a\nthought provoking social commentary on many modern day issues and what\nit is like to bring life into the modern world.<br><br>I very much enjoyed District 9 but I would even go as far to say I\nenjoyed Chappie much, much more.<br><br>There were so many aspects to this film that could have went wrong but\nhave been nailed on the head by the director. The effect once again\nvisually striking and a very well paced and intricate development of\ncharacters as well as interesting set design helps keep chappie fresh\nand not just another reboot of any other sci fi film as critics will\nhave you believe.<br><br>I would also say I enjoyed this film much, much more than the likes of\nrobo-cop.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is not just an excellent and entertaining movie, i found many\nelements as real/istic and present, it is just touched some (maybe)\nfuture elements. Neil pulled the maximum out of this story and made it\nunforgettable as District 9 was.<br><br>How ever, my stomach turns upside down when i see the Metacritic or\nRotten Tomatoes score, these pathetic sites and their brainless people\n(called themselves \"critics\") live amongst us with their nonsense and\nempty headed, braintumored criticism - sure, this movie has no Beverly\nHills and it's \"amazing\" crowd, no lemonade punch as story, no muscle\ncars and no muscle people, no worldwide threat to the USA and such. It\nhas something else to say and this is the core of this amazing movie.<br><br>Afterall, Chappie has Everything that needs for a unique and must-see\nmovie, sure, it is a target for all those (disgusting) critics who\nexpect the everyday boring lemonade with everyday boring actors and\nactress.<br><br>Shame on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, you guys are not more, than\njust rotten and brainless second level scribblers.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhy all the hate for this movie? I understand not liking something, but\neveryone seems to just TRASH it. Did I see the same movie? I saw an\nemotional film about innocence and loss. I REALLY don't understand.\nSure, maybe the film didn't have the best dialogue or the best acting\nin the world, but it hit home for me. The VFX were phenomenal, Chappie\nis the best CGI motion capture I have seen in a long time, the 100%\nelectronic musical score by Hans Zimmer was really unique and fresh,\nand it has a really great ending. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. If you like\nBlomkamp's previous films or are remotely interested, please watch it\nyourself. I think the critics are wrong on this one. I have been\nthinking for a while about why the reviews are so out there. First off,\nthe trailers are AWFUL. The first to come out was this philosophical\n\"What does it mean to be human?\" kinda movie. The TV trailers were\n\"GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, ROBOTS!!!\" and it is neither. Think \"Little Miss\nSunshine\" with a robot, that is a more accurate representation.\nBlomkamp's most underrated film.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a great movie definitely in the style of Niell Blomkamp.\nHowever, some people might consider this a fault, as Elysium was a\nlittle off the mark. What is great about the movie is its style. They\nreally went all out with Yolandi and Ninja (the main characters part of\nthe musical group Die Antwoord). Hugh Jackman is pretty hilarious as a\nbloodthirsty war vet, selling his role pretty well. The technology in\nthis movie is fantastic, as usual coming from Blomkamp, leaving plenty\nof ideas for the imagination to wonder about for the future. Of course,\nChappie really makes this movie; taking something so technical and\nrobotic, making it human in action. He really gets the feels going. I\nhaven't laughed like that in a movie theater in a long time. Add to\nthat the oddness of the characters influencing the development of\nChappie, this movie is gangster. <br><br>Still, 9/10, super great movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI liked District 9 and Elysium, so I was really looking forward to\nChappie, especially for the special effects that I'd seen in those\nprevious films. I felt like Chappie needed to be at least another hour\nlonger to convey the director's message properly. There are way too\nmany holes in the story to lead to such a thought-provoking ending.\nI'll say there was sufficient delivery on the special effects, but the\nstory was not extensive enough. One - there's no explanation as to why\n\"Ninja\" and his mates owe some master criminal millions of dollars; two\n- one minute Chappie's being bullied by thugs and the next we're to\nexpect they're loving foster parents; and three - why would\ntransferring one's \"consciousness\" to another being also carry their\nvoice and accent over? I expect a movie to suspend my beliefs for a\ncouple of hours, but a story that flows well makes for $ better spent.\n"},
{"review": "\nI went into Chappie as a huge fan of the gritty action and social\ncommentary of District 9. I expected that this would be more of the\nsame. Both are still present, but surprisingly, with laughs.<br><br>This is one of the more entertaining movies from every angle that I've\nseen in awhile. I described it as I left as funny, sad, uplifting,\ndark, light, silly, and tense.<br><br>The center of the story is Chappie. He is a hero you want to shelter,\neven though you want him to learn. But even as you love his curiosity,\nyou fear his naivet\u00e9. He is the most complex character, and gives a\nfascinating paradigm into how children must receive and process human\nsociety and contradiction. There are some inconsistencies in Chappie's\ncharacter (is he already programmed to raise his voice if he's scared,\nor did he learn that?), but he still succeeds as a dynamic, independent\nbeing.<br><br>Yes, the humans characters are flat. They are merely roles. The Maker.\nThe Villain. Mommy and Daddy. The friend. But as Chappie begins to\nlearn, you see why they have to be flat. They are trying to exert\ninfluence on a (robotic) child. Therefore, they must simplify their own\nmotivations and desires into the most basic explanations possible for\nChappie to understand. This leads to hilarious imitation and\nthought-provoking perspectives.<br><br>Chappie's curiosity was once ours. Chappie's confusion was once ours.\nWatching Chappie is like watching a sped-up version of childhood social\nand moral development, with all of the Hollywood tension, explosions,\nand naughty words to keep you interested, too. There are parts to laugh\nat because it's funny, parts to laugh at because the costuming and set\ndesign is ridiculous, but you still end up thinking seriously the whole\ntime.<br><br>Give it a chance. You might love it. I did.\n"},
{"review": "\nChappie is exuberant, playful, funny and perhaps one of the most human\ncharacters to grace the screen in years. He's an unwilling action hero\nthat one can both identify with and admire. His story is gripping and\nwill keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately some of Chappie's\nbrilliance comes at the expense of the world around him. Plot holes and\nlogical fallacies abound, and although some of it can be written off to\nthe imperfection of humanity (a central theme in the movie) there are\nenough \"Wait, why the would he/she/they do X.\"\" moments to be a\nsignificant distraction.<br><br>Many reviewers have complained that Chappie Clich\u00e9. In an era where the\nmajority of box office darlings with &gt;8 star reviews are remakes,\nreboots or result of the Disney/Pixar/Marvel equation the majority of\nthose reviewers are clearly either hypocrites or they don't know what\nclich\u00e9 means. Chappie is soaked in the Blomkamp style and while that\nstyle was new and fresh with District 9, its unreasonable to expect a\ndirector's primary product to be novelty.<br><br>Overall it's a good movie, certainly more interesting than most of the\nbox-office-safe fare out that's been out there.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe big problem with this movie is that none of the characters are\nlikable. Chappie's \"family\" is made up of criminals who raise him to be\na \"gangsta\" / \"pimp\" complete with bling. I don't know if this was\nsupposed to come off as heartwarming, but it's just stupid and corny as\nhell. I kept hoping they would die the entire movie.<br><br>Chappie himself is like an annoying little kid who does stupid things\nand lacks common sense. The worst part is the accent. I don't know if\nthat's how real South Africans talk, but it just did not fit a robot at\nall and was really obnoxious to listen to. It was like the movie tried\ntoo hard to be cool.<br><br>Combine all this with a plot that is nonsense. For example:<br><br>Chappie's maker is like the next Steve Jobs, yet he works in a cubicle\nin what resembles a run down warehouse.<br><br>The computers look like they came from the 80's, complete with DOS.\nSeriously? Did South Africa not get Windows?<br><br>The gangsters let Chappie's maker go free repeatedly for no apparent\nreason when he could obviously have gone to the police at any point.\nAre these the dumbest criminals in the world?<br><br>These are just a few examples of the idiotic script.<br><br>Another thing is people keep mentioning how great the director is. I\nhonestly don't care what he directed in the past. This movie sucks.\n"},
{"review": "\nI don't usually write reviews on here, but I have to get this off my\nchest. This is more of a warning than a review.<br><br>I saw the high rating on IMDb and gave this movie a shot. The trailer\nlooked decent and reminded me of good action scenes in District 9. I\nwanted to leave while watching the movie so many times. I kept waiting\nfor it to get better, but it never did... I had my hopes up when the\nthugs were teaching Chappie how to stab people that he'd stab them, I'd\nhave a laugh, and we'd move on to some other characters and a better\nmovie! But I was let down on that one. The movie doesn't go anywhere.\nYou just hang out with the obnoxious Die Antwoord members the whole\ntime. Others have mentioned the movie being like Short Circuit and\nRobocop, but the movie even adds a flare of Transcendence towards the\nend -- Chappie figures out how to transfer consciousness to save his\nmaker, himself and even \"mommy.\" Ninja keeps going on about a heist he\nwants Chappie to help him with the whole movie. The heist was my ticket\nprice and 2 hours. I felt frustrated and let down after watching this\nmovie. I don't get how other people seem to like it? Must be Die\nAntwoord fans. I wish I never saw the film.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe trailer of the movie talks about the black sheep, that is being\ndifferent, So I would say this one was the black sheep in the world of\nsci-fi movies.<br><br>The story of a robot, which is being depicted in unbiased manner( not\nrobot-as-a-monster or robot-as-an-angel movie) is quiet refreshing. The\nrobot Chappie not just marvels you but make you emotional at times. So\nbe prepared to get your eyes drenched at times. I think these are some\nof those moments when you feel this is not a sci-fi or action\nstereotype, but that is what makes it wonderful.<br><br>Action cuts are great(very less of them), actor have done wonderful job\n(especially the lady who acts as Chappies \"mommie\")<br><br>Loved it.<br><br>P.S.

{"review": "\nI found the movie highly entertaining and thought-provoking, funny and\ndistressing at the same time.<br><br>Couldn't help but think about how true this story is: your child\nassociates with the \"wrong crowd\" and no matter how much you try, what\nyou say, s/he is going down a bad path. All you can hope for is that\nthey'll find their real self before it's too late...<br><br>I usually don't like violent movies, or films about gangsters,\ndruggies, and such.

{"review": "\nThis movie has so many holes that I cannot even cover them all. I love\nhow movie makers think of Artificial Intelligence as Artificial\nFeeling. It was really ridiculous that the robot immediately started\nacting like a child as soon as it had AI. A machine will act like a\nchild only if it's programmed to behave like one. Not just by giving it\nself awareness. It was also stupid that the movie tried to make heroes\nout of the stupid vicious criminals. And implanting the consciousness\nto new body to achieve immortality, this has been used in the movie The\n6th day with Arnold Schwartzenegger. Implant memory to new cloned body\nto live forever. But is this real immortality? If your body die as soon\nas you transfer your consciousness, it may seem like immortality but\nwhat if your body doesn't die? And this clone with your memory is\nstanding in front of you. Is that clone really you?

{"review": "\nI was going into this movie the other day expecting a quite decent\nsci-fi action movie with a bit of a story but the end result wasn't\npretty. Some of the reasons why this is bad include every time the\nSouth African duo Die Antwoord was on screen, I had never heard of them\nbefore and never hope to hear of them again as I found their acting to\nbe woeful, probably the worst I've bore witness too, the story being\nborderline ridiculous at times, the dialog was at times hard to\nunderstand and the whole gangsta talk really isn't my cup of tea in\nthis sort of movie and hopefully last but not least, Dev Patel as a\nleading man. Patel, in my opinion, could improve as an actor after\ngetting his lucky break in Slumdog Millionaire as it is now two below\npar roles in the one year, after the Second Best Marigold Hotel and is\nin definite need of improvement. One of the only positives I can glean\nfrom this mess of a movie is Hugh Jackman's performance as he tries his\nbest in a villainous type role which I don't think I have seen from him\nbefore. Anyway, all involved must, and should be shaking their heads\nfuriously at what they had done. This is the first Neill Blomkamp film\nI have watched and I will go back and watch his other two but if he\nkeeps making movies like Chappie, his career will be over before it\nbegins.

The plot of\nChappie, his creator and the creator of the whole U.I. program Deon\nWilson and the villainous character played by Hugh Jackman, Vincent\nMoore. Vincent Moore basically had created his own program of these\ngiant two legged robots which are run by humans controlling them with\nthese helmets that link to their minds. The only confusing part is they\nare run by human mind but he still has to sit in this chair and have\nthis giant joystick to control his robots. If they lest the stupidity\nof the Gangsters and left it to Vincent Moore and his robot vs Deon\nWilson and his robot army and Chappie this movie would be one of the\nbest of all time. Yo-landi is just creepy and can't act period, Ninja\njust can't act and looks like an idiot through the whole movie. They\nmake Ninja look smart by how he controls Chappie but at other times\nthey make him look idiotic which again is illogical. Then Hippo is just\nan angry meathead.

{"review": "\nSouth African director Neill Blomkamp's debut movie, DISTRICT 9,\nremains a masterpiece, and his follow-up ELYSIUM is a very good piece\nof action spectacle. Sadly, the magic isn't repeated for this, his\nthird film, an odd concoction of rehashes of old material and\ndisappointing new elements.<br><br>The first thing you notice about CHAPPIE is its familiarity. The whole\nrobot cop thing is heavily derived from ROBOCOP and the presence of an\nED-209 style robot makes it even more obvious. Secondly, the idea of a\nsentient, learning robot brings to mind the glory days of the SHORT\nCIRCUIT film in the 1980s; they were childhood favourites of mine. Plus\nthe social milieu and gangster type stuff is familiar from the\ndirector's previous films.<br><br>Sadly, CHAPPIE makes the crucial error of failing to have the\nprotagonist be sympathetic at all. The reliable Sharlto Copley does his\nbest with the voice and mo-cap work, but Chappie is just a mildly\nannoying robot, nothing more. Attempts to turn him into a gangster take\nup much of the running time, but the non-actors who play the gangsters\noveract for the most part and are very annoying.<br><br>It's a pity that this film feels so directionless, because there's good\nstuff here. The CGI effects are exemplary, as you'd expect from a\nBlomkamp movie. There's not much action, but the big set-piece climax\nis very well staged. A supporting turn from Hugh Jackman is one of the\nbest performances in the whole thing, although Sigourney Weaver is\nwasted in an extraneous part. When you sit down and watch CHAPPIE, you\nsee the framework of a part-decent movie buried beneath a lumbering and\nuneven execution, and I think that's a real shame. Let's hope Blomkamp\ncan pick it up again for his forthcoming ALIENS movie...\n"},

In a time of Marvel juggernauts and assorted sagas to\nsave the world it manages to stand out ever so slightly.<br><br>I like for example how we start with one of those dystopian near-\nfutures but quickly pare it down to one robot, its maker and a few\ngangsters who kidnap it to be part of a scheme.

A simple structure here:\nsomething that absorbs and imitates its surroundings, in our case a\nmechanism (a robot) but more pertinently a self, a consciousness in the\nmidst of images. It is enough to think of it with a Dickensian orphan\nin mind to quickly know it is contrived drama but it creates an\nunderstanding of consciousness, not dutiful - solid - reproduction but\nan impromptu jam that capriciously occupies the room set for it.<br><br>And this is what the filmmaker does, he absorbs Robocop complete with\nits world and conundrums, imitates it enough to acknowledge that he\ndoes - in the rival cyborg, in the grueling scene of torment - but\nflies off in his own way.

For me this gives his films far more\ngravitas than the other vacuous tripe Hollywood churns out.<br><br>On the face of it, \"Chappie\" is a great action movie, with elements of\n\"Robocop,\" \"Short-Circuit,\" and \"Blade Runner,\" but it also ponders\ncontemporary issues such as our increasing reliance on Artificial\nIntelligence and robots, corporate corruption, militarization of the\npolice, and the negative influences on our easily impressionable youth.\nIt was a movie about compassion, and the great loss society suffers\nwhen it can't save its children from poisonous familial and social\nenvironments. But it also had loads of awesomely directed action, and a\ngood amount of humor.<br><br>I'm definitely not saying Blomkamp is subtle or overly poetic in his\napproach or style in relaying his philosophical themes, but, for me,\nit's entertaining; close in thudding style to Paul Verhoeven.<br><br>Overall \"Chappie\" is an extremely sweet movie with a ton of heart. I\njust hope it's lack of financial and critical success doesn't\nnegatively affect Blomkamp's career, as I think he's an important\nfilmmaker with a lot to say. And he says it within the framework of\neasily digestible and entertaining sci-fi action flicks, which I love.\n"},

But all in all it is a\ngreat movie. With a good ending, Although I find that the M.O.O.S.E\nwhich Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) tries to promote is a great waste of\ntime.

{"review": "\nWhen I first learned of this movie coming to theaters, I was excited\nabout it, seeing that I had admired director Neil Blomkamp's \"District\n9\". Then the largely negative and brutal reviews came out, and that\ncancelled my plans to see it in theaters or to pay any money to rent it\non video. But when I came across a DVD copy of it at my local library,\nI decided to give it a look, seeing that I would be able to watch it\nfor free.<br><br>After watching it, I am kind of puzzled by why the movie got an\nextremely hostile response. Yes, the movie is not perfect; it has some\nflaws, some severe. The script steals some ideas from other movies,\nmost notably \"Robocop\" but even Blomkamp's \"District 9\". The various\nhuman characters are those that we have seen many times before, from\nthe cold-hearted female executive to the soft-hearted girlfriend of the\nmain criminal character. However, the biggest problem with the movie is\nthe character of the robot Chappie. When he starts to speak and commit\nactions, he often comes across as a robotic version of Jar Jar Binks -\nannoying, in other words. I know that Blomkamp was trying to show\nChappie was a learning and easily manipulative artificial life form,\nbut I think he could have portrayed this in a less sledgehammer style.<br><br>Despite flaws like those, the movie does deliver in some areas. The\nspecial effects are very good for the most part; you'll really feel\nthat Chappie is a true mechanical yet living object. The action\nsequences have some genuine excitement. And while the movie runs two\nhours in length, there are no slow or boring parts; the movie really\nzips along.<br><br>The verdict? Well, as I said, there are some severe flaws in the movie,\nbut I don't think it's downright terrible. I would recommend you wait\nto watch the movie when you are in an uncritical mood and have the\nopportunity to see it for free, as I did.\n"},
