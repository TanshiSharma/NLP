{"review": "\nAs I write this review, there are around 200 reviews posted. As far as\nI can tell, fewer than 10 of them rate this film at 7 stars or above,\nyet its average rating is slightly more than 7 stars. In fact, while\nthe vast majority of reviews on the first five pages give it only 1\nstar, the ratings summary says that only 1.2% of those rating it gave\nit just 1 star.<br><br>This is a long way of saying that it's now inescapable fact that\ntrolls, spoofers, and studio shills dominate the site. A system is only\nuseful until enough people figure out how to game it, and this is\n(sadly) now the case for this site.<br><br>On to the review: Neighbors had a big challenge to overcome with me, as\nI just don't normally find Seth R. and his \"Seth Pack\" to be very\nfunny. Unfortunately, this film fails on every level to provide either\nhumor or entertainment. It's a rare film that can depict all characters\nas totally unsympathetic and get away with it. After all, the viewer\nneeds to be able to identify with SOMEONE in a story or film, even if\nit's the third-party narrator. This movie has absolutely no sympathetic\ncharacters in it at all. It's the essence of comedic nihilism. I didn't\nlike any of the characters, none of them said anything that was vaguely\nfunny, and I didn't identify with any point of view expressed in the\nfilm. To make matters worse, the director relied solely on profanity\nand T&amp;A for shock value.<br><br>Totally worthless movie. Don't waste your time.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you are looking for a great comedy movie,this film is certainly not\nfor you. It is an awful R-rated movie with sex and without comedy. It\nwill remind you of Jackass because you will see graphic nudity (sexual\nintercourse between a man and a woman,a man was forced to suck a\ndildo,people reveal their butts and throw fire works by means of their\nbutts). Honestly,I did not find this movie worth watching at\nall,because it lacks 90 % of comedy and it tries to tempt the audience\nto see it through cheesy and explicit sex. Take my advice and save your\nmoney and time and see a better movie. Do not believe the hyperbolic\nrating!. Neighbors(2014) is an awful sex movie that disguises as a\ncomedy movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI didn't laugh once during the entire movie. The writing was lame and\nthe acting was horrible. The movie was probably geared to 16 year old\nboys.

Are you sure you\nwant to do it? Yes let's do it. OK I will do it to them. You go baby\nand do it to them. OK, here I go. I wanted to puke the writing was so\nbad.

{"review": "\nMy distaste for \"Neighbors\" has little to do with the overall poorness\nof its quality. What gets me is the film's basic opinion of what is, or\nshould be considered, funny - an opinion that disgusts and depresses\nme, and doesn't speak well of who we are as people. Seth Rogen (moping\naround without a hint of comic energy or skill) plays a loser who gets\ndrenched with a deluge of filthy butt gags. Now comes the depressing\npart: The movie (just like several Will Ferrel films) can't think of\nanything for the \"hero\" to do with himself except to hurt and humiliate\nthe people who interfere with with desire to get what he wants. And\nwe're supposed to LIKE it. We're supposed to be CHEERING for these\nbabyish acts of sadism. Cruelty and amorality CAN, in fact, be a source\nof humor (I consider \"Ruthless People\" one of the greatest comedies\never), and \"Neighbors\" does provide one character (an ego maniacal\nMe-generation yype) who's a fit target for the audience to enjoy a\nlittle slap-down. But this overall assumption that there's an inherent\njoy in seeing innocent people get injured or embarrassed (also\ncharacteristic of Adam Sandler movies) leaves me asking, \"What kind of\nworld am I living in? What's WRONG with people?\"\n"},
{"review": "\nI like comedies, and was looking forward to an experience in the same\nalley as the \"Hangover\"-movies. But \"Bad Neighbours\" was probably an\nall time low for me. This film probably sets a new record in using the\nwords sh*t, fu*k and d*ck. Together with other kinds of swearing.\nNormally swearing doesn't bother me at all, but this time it just gets\nboring. The whole movie is a repeat of itself. Parties and \"can you\nkeep it down, please?\" If that sounds fun, go ahead and watch it! What\nis the punchline? Is there really a punchline? I couldn't fine any.\nZach Efron is, as always, quite handsome and a quite talented actor.\nUnfortunately that doesn't help much. The storyline is too thin. A\ntotal waste of money for me.\n"},

{"review": "\nDear Seth,<br><br>I just watched your latest effort in the \"Neighbors\". Here are a few\ntips for you, your current and future directors, writers, producers and\nmovie execs, to help you to not make another movie that my somewhat\nintoxicated adult friends turn off less than half way through.<br><br>1. Saying \"F*ck\" in every sentence does not give you street cred, nor\nis it particularly humorous after about 5 seconds. 2. You are in crappy\nphysical shape. Quit having your writers put in sex scenes with you and\nthe obviously unattainable women you are cast with. The sexual\nchemistry between you and Rose Byrne was about as believable as the\nchemistry between a swan and a water buffalo. 3. Watching a nearly\nmiddle-aged man-child get f'd up on shrooms, pot, etc. is about as\nentertaining as watching a dog lick its b*lls. It is mildly\nentertaining for about 10 seconds, and then is simply disgusting and\nannoying. 4. You are NOT a modern Jimmy Stewart \"everyman\" character.\nYou are in fact the very antithesis of that. Overweight, pot smoking,\nvideo game playing D'bags that refuse to grow up have very little in\ncommon with folks that have to work for a living, raise a family and\nmuddle through. 5. You are a middling character actor that, through\nsome Faustian bargain, has become a quasi-leading man in romantic,\nraunchy comedies. Grow the F up, learn a little more range of emotion\nthan \"Holy F*ck Man\" and \"I'm so F*cked up\", and maybe you can keep you\nsoul (if you indeed ever had one).<br><br>Sincerely, Raynjuls\n"},

They simply don't care. No one older than a four\nyear old (or someone profoundly retarded) would mistake this swill for\nhumor.<br><br>I didn't expect much, of course. Who would? But I at least thought\nthere would be a coherent storyline or plot structure. Not that it's\nneeded if you have a bunch of ace improv'ers. But Rogan has never been\nin that league. He can be amusing on occasion but he tends to rise or\nfall with the quality of the film, director, and other actors he's\nsharing screen time with. Many times he's just the weakest link. There\nare points in \"Neighbors\" when the flat chemistry between Rogan and\nByrne threatens to deafen you even more than the soundtrack (which is\nactually quite good). Neither seems to know what to say next but,\nreally, what *does* one say after you're forced to spray breast milk\ninto the face of your co-thespian? The desperation here is\nexcruciatingly palpable.<br><br>And how about those mostly stellar mainstream media reviews? The Rotten\nTomato average is 73% with many huge outlets loving this piece of crap.\nIt just proves how much Universal obviously threw around promoting this\nwonderful flagship for their 100th anniversary. They should be so\nproud. One for the box set, I bet (sadly true - most of the films in\nmany of the big studio's 100th anniversary boxes this decade focus on\nsales over quality --- only exception taken if the film's a big Oscar\nwinner.

This film actually made a lot of\nmoney which is another horrifying gauge of the cultural devolution of\nour society towards single celled life that will ultimately function\nwith no brain, apparently only having a mouth to eat &amp; eyes to watch\nflickering images of mediocre talents who have somehow been relegated\nto star status by accident or via satanic contracts. The premise of\nthis movie is simplistic enough and continues to remain unsalvaged by\nany further indication of creativity as it progresses and I use that\nterm in its chronological sense only. It's probably even dumber than\nthe half baked idea for a movie you wrote one afternoon on the\npartially used napkin you stuffed in your coat pocket after lunch\nexcept you had the good sense to realize later upon further reflection\nthat it was as tainted as the stain left by the remnant of the salad\ndressing adjoining it. I laughed one time in this movie although\ntechnically it was probably more of a chortle or a snigger rather than\na guffaw. Rogen's brilliant specialty appears to be jokes about naughty\nbody parts ( penises are emphasized in this flick with boobs placing a\ndistant second ) and pot. These concepts may in fact work if ever\ninjected with any actual humorous aspects but no such consideration\nremotely exists in this script. I gave it 2 stars because any movie\ngets one star for simply existing although I could be tempted give it 5\nstars if we could go back in time and delete it meaning that I wouldn't\nbe subjected to viewing it in the first place and that's a potentially\ncontradictory comedic premise that this crew could clog with dick and\nreefer jokes.\n"},

Obviously, the humour will definitely not be for everyone and is\ntargeted to a specific group of people.<br><br>Best Part: The airbags...<br><br>MVP: Seth Rogen as Mac Radner<br><br>7/10\n"},
{"review": "\nFor what this is, this is just fine. The whole gambit, which is the\ndifference between Appatow stuff that work and those that don't, is to\nhave skits that mask themselves out by spontaneity and characters that\nyou can buy as people who are troubled by real stuff before they have\nto morph for the cartoon. They do it here mostly. A lot of it is down\nto Rogen and Byrne conveying a great vexation.<br><br>It's about this couple of 30 year olds who have ushered into proper\nadulthood, bought their first house in the suburbs and just had a baby.\nThe film begins with the notion that maybe they would like to party\nonce in a while but this new life is too hectic. What do you know, a\nsorority moves next-door, reminder of crazy youth they have to leave\nbehind and are probably better off for it.<br><br>Enjoyable to watch overall and more of a breeze than not, which is what\nI expect to get out of a night with this.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe basic idea of the plot had comedic potential, and the beginning was\nokay. As the movie went on, however, it stopped being funny and I\nfast-forwarded through most of the second half. Characters lacked depth\nand were unrelatable, jokes were either really predictable or crude in\na bad way, and I didn't laugh the entire time (and I'm not a tough\naudience for comedies). <br><br>By the end of the movie I felt like I had lost some faith in humanity\n(because of its high rating.) Thankfully I read other reviews on here\nthough, and it seems like most people found this movie terrible. I'm\nreally not sure why \"professional\" review sites had such good things to\nsay- I'm guessing they were payed?<br><br>Anyways, 2 stars for the beginning which was okay, and because some of\nthe party scenes were cool to watch.\n"},
{"review": "\nA truly awful attempt at comedy. Not sure that there a single line or\nscene that had even the slightest chance of generating laughter. <br><br>Roughly set - the fraternity (led by Zac Efron, looking more and more\nlike John Stamos) moves in next door and causes too much noise for the\nfamily (Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne) raising a baby. First, the neighbors\nattempt to win the boys over by being cool. Being cool meaning spending\nall-night at the frat party and watching the baby through the use of a\nbaby- monitor. Good parenting at its best, but the premise can be\noverlooked in the pursuit of comedy.<br><br>When the boys have another party and do not respond to phone calls to\nkeep it down, the neighbors call the cops who are as unsympathetic to\ntheir plight as could be imagined. And so, taking matters into their\nown hands, begins the ever-escalating attempts to get the frat boys to\nleave or to be banned by the school, and the counterattacks to make the\nneighbors truly miserable.<br><br>Nothing original. All over the top. Not grounded in any semblance of\nreality. The writers and director should rewatch Animal House to see\nhow this genre was meant to be made.<br><br>And the \"good news\" - this movie made so much money that a sequel has\njust been announced. I cannot wait.<br><br>To see my other movie reviews, please visit:<br><br>https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a silly movie. With this theme of course it would be, but at\nleast it could have some funny moments. But I didn't laugh or even\nsmiled at one single thing. Seth is really starting to be more than\nrepetitive in every part his on. Its just the same character all the\ntime. The only one that has some kind of funny bone in this movie is\nRose Byrne when she tries to be the \"cool\" person. <br><br>This movie does not work. The youngster in the party house ain't funny\nat all and are only annoying. When the couple and the college kids\nparty together and start to become friends its so bad that its beyond\nbad, I actually feel bad for the script that has to have this\ncombination of words put together. And the actors suck and surprisingly\nmake it even worse, and thats an achievement in itself. The inescapable\nconflict between the two houses could have some funny moments. But its\nmore like a background environment for Seths bad lines.<br><br>If you want to watch comedies, there are a lot better than this around.\nEven in the silly party movies category.\n"},
{"review": "\nMy My, what an awful movie. Made no sense except for excuses to talk\ndirty and have lots of sex. The best part was the end. IT ENDED. Most\nmovies nowadays, and this is no exception. are made for the young\ncrowd, like 18- 29. When will screenwriters write real stories with\nREAL characters use real actors. This movie was atrocious garbage. I\nknow its only a movie and not supposed to make sense, but wouldn't the\nother neighbors have complained, even if they were 'helped' a bit by\nthe kooks that infiltrated the house? No matter how you look at this\nmovie, it stinks. Why did I finish it? Only to see if there were some\nredeeming values. None. So if you're looking for an ill-conceived,\ndirty, filthy, rotten mean spirited, terrible acted and inane movie. DO\nSEE THIS ONE\n"},
{"review": "\nA couple with a young baby are tormented by a group of students who\nmove into the house next door. Despite a promising premise and a good\nfirst 15 minutes this quickly degenerates into a lame lowbrow comedy\nwith absolutely no class. <br><br>I'm not a massive Seth Rogen fan as he just plays the same character in\nevery film. His wife is played by Rose Byrne who brings nothing to the\ntable apart from the ability to be irritating. Strangely enough the\nacting honours are taken by Zak Effron which I think says it all about\nthis film. <br><br>The toilet humour wears thin quickly and has been done better in many\nfilms before it. The film meanders aimlessly from one unfunny situation\nto another aided only by more witless moronic dialogue. The only thing\nI'll remember this for is the young baby (probably the cutest baby yet\ncommitted to celluloid) who also happens to raise the only laughs in\nthe film. <br><br>Unless you are a massive Seth Rogen fan there is little to recommend\nthis very poor comedy and it must be watched with the lowest possible\nexpectations.\n"},
{"review": "\nSeriously, I think Seth Rogan is a good actor to make some parts as\n'the dumb person', but this sex jokes are getting annoying. In the\nfirst scene I already get a bad feeling about the movie. The first joke\nis about the baby won't notice what they are doing, she only gets\nbouncy balls and that she will see Mac balls bouncing. And it is just\nall about that stuff. Plastic dildo's made out of the boys penis, and\nthe big one gets Kenny's ex-wife, a 'fight' that one guy hold the other\nballs(?!) and he gets a hard one? I don't know what's the fun nowadays\nto laugh at this anymore. I really encourage that these kind of jokes\ncould be changed, or even taken down a notch; or maybe two; how about\n5. Kids can also laugh at other situations without recurring to sex\nreferences and all that. Besides, that 'Ass Juice' pledge, seriously?!\n"}
