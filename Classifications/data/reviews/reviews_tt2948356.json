She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is\nsmall and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer.<br><br>She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for\nher,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already\ncommitted a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to\navoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding\nthe missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends\nand because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she\ncleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to\nrefrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this\nyummy bunny Judy.<br><br>Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular\ncinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and stunning acting.\n"},

{"review": "\nPlot: In a city of anthropomorphic animals, a rookie bunny cop and a\ncynical con artist fox must work together to uncover a conspiracy.<br><br>This was a film that I was hoping would be good, since most trailers\ncan trick you these days but this film surpassed my expectations. Each\nof the voice actors do a wonderful job playing their characters, the\nstandouts are Ginnifer Goodwin who plays a really likable and relatable\ncharacter and Jason Bateman who plays a character that is at fist\nunlikable but manages to improve throughout the film. This is not your\ntypical kids film, it doesn't have the bathroom jokes like in most kids\nfilms. The script is smartly written and uses the message effectively\nunlike others which beats you over the head with theirs.<br><br>Zootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen\nit, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I\nlike, I just wish more of them were like this.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's rare to find a movie that fails in one category but pulls itself\nup in another, only to cycle through this pattern many times over.\nZootopia feels like it's trying to pull itself up until it adds another\nplot point into the film.<br><br>So my main issue with the movie is that it ties up it's plot-points too\nquickly near the end. Like, it resolves the mystery, Weaselton, Mr.\nBig, and Nick and Judy hating each other in about 10 minutes.<br><br>The action scenes were all good, the train scene being a genius scene.\nThe issue is the movie feels it needs to add something to the plot\nwhich doesn't do much to the film to put in another scene, like how we\nhave to have a panther go savage just so we get a chase scene in the\njungle.<br><br>The issue holds true for not any other area of the film. There's also\nthe villain's motivation, and if you haven't seen YMS, that motivation\nis \"I'm really really racist\". It would have been nice for Bellwether\nto be developed on more instead of coming in and having no reason\nexcept being racist for being evil.<br><br>All in all, Zootopia does have a lot of good things. The music is good,\nthe action scenes are fluid, the characters are great, I loved the\nworld, but the villain killed the movie for me. I can find enjoyment in\nthis, but it's not the best. Watch it with some friends, or alone if\nyou just love Disney. It's a good film, but it could be better.\n"},
{"review": "\nStupidity took this movie down while the premise still had some allure\nas being somewhat of a modern-day \"animal farm\"but sadly that wasn't\nthe case here.<br><br>It is certainly not a classic because it's build to much in to today's\nstandards and contains the same elements as a lot of today's movies\nlike feminism,racism and sexism.<br><br>Other factors that are connected to theses elements are not so much\nhighlighted like religion or social structures within this society. It\nwants to preach diversity but gives a one-sided view to the story and\ngives all kinds of awkward messages doing so.<br><br>All the focus was on the bunny and the rest of the characters seem to\ntag a long to make sure everyone is better in the end by meeting her\nbecause she is such an inspiration.It reminded me a little of the\n'Rey\"character in\" the forge awakens\"but than to a lesser extent.A\n\"close to Mary Sue\" character basically.<br><br>I wanted more entertainment out this and also a story that served all\nthe people and not the few \"hot topics\"that are only important for a\ncouple of years.I think that with the passing of time the movie will\nloose momentum<br><br>and that it is not the timeless piece that people said it was.<br><br>The Shakira song was terrible and did not fit the movie at all and the\nanimation was \"acceptable\".I had a few laughs but not nearly as many as\ni get from watching a 20 minute episode of Southpark.<br><br>I was disappointed by it but by looking at the raving reviews realized\nI pretty much stand alone in this.<br><br>It's not bad.....just blatant PC.<br><br>Nice bunny,but no bugs!<br><br>Fox this!\n"},
{"review": "\nA cute female rabbit becomes a police officer and is instantly the best\nofficer the world has ever seen - surpassing all of her dumb male co-\nworkers who belittle her for being just a cute dumb bunny. The film\nthen descends into a commentary on racial issues as the rabbit says\nthat a bunch of predators may be attacking people as \"its in their DNA\"\nand the media and politicians whip up mass hysteria to control the\npeople (ok, that part is pretty valid). The rabbit then learns her\nlesson about how it's wrong to call out dangerous criminals if they're\nall from the same race, and that it was really the government\nmanipulating the predators into being evil.<br><br>The sloths were pretty funny, though.\n"},
{"review": "\nI enjoyed this movie far more than i expected to.<br><br>Things i liked.<br><br>The relationship between judy hopps and nick wilde was really special\nand i enjoyed watching their interaction and growing friendship, they\nare both as heroic and smart as one another and although judy is this\nadventurous and outgoing go getter type of character for a few brief\nscenes she also had an emotional side i think it was delivered with\ngreat balance. I take zero pleasure admitting tears were in my eyes\nthroughout this movie.<br><br>The humour although present throughout was never shoved down your\nthroat which lead to a nice upbeat and colourful atmosphere and that's\nnot to mention all the great design decisions behind the world created\nhere. For example Ergonomics with giraffes in mind e.g a funnel to\ndeliver a drink from ground level to giraffe height and small doors for\nmice. People should watch this movie for the world alone.<br><br>I could continue to shower this gem with praise but instead i'll list\nthe things that bothered me about this film, the first thing is that\nthe film was too short like no really i wish this film lasted an hour\nor so longer, the plot seems incredibly rushed at the end i never saw\nthe plot twist coming and didn't predict the direction the film would\ngo down but i feel it's because the culprit behind it all has come and\ngone within 5 minutes is arrested there's no build up or tension in the\nuncovering of the secrets behind the commotion which is a shame. I also\nfeel like the chief of police was a relatively poor character and most\nof the characters in the film could do with more fleshing out.<br><br>All things said and done go watch this it is great.\n"},
{"review": "\nZootopia is Disney's latest propaganda piece for the fascist police\nstate. They don't even bother to be subtle any more; nothing is left to\nthe imagination. It's all here - the 99 percent vs the one percent,\ncops who just want to serve and protect you (and BTW they're definitely\nNOT serving the one percent), and ubiquitous public cameras that help\nsolve crimes. And the punch line? The one percent are really your\nfriends - it's those ingrate 99-percenters who are the real criminals.<br><br>This film is wonderful way to encourage impressionable young children\nto conform into little statist robots who will gladly empty their minds\nand hearts to serve as a cog in the machine of the modern lie.<br><br>And now, a message from your master...\n"},
{"review": "\nBright, bubbly, breakneck: all defining characteristics of Disney's\nlatest animated adventure. Sanctimonious, serious, seldom funny: other\nkey traits that suffocate this family film until there's very little\nleft to enjoy. With multiple ecosystems and a plethora of cultural\nsubsets \u0096 mirroring our own society wouldn't you know \u0096 the\nanthropomorphic animal-world is conceptually interesting and\nbeautifully animated, but the story told within this universe is\ndisappointingly dull. The simple predators-and-prey-living-together\nplot device should've been ripe for subtle metaphors amongst zippy\naction and constant laughs, yet the film's themes \u0096 breaking down\nstereotypes, looking past race, being inclusive \u0096 are hammered home so\nheavy-handedly it feels like you're getting in trouble. A major issue\nis the lack of humour (or more accurately: successful humour) which,\nsave for a truly hilarious sloth-centred sequence that had me in tears,\nis woefully misjudged and/or drowned out by the persistence of shoving\na point down our throat. The muddled tone makes for a confusing viewing\ntoo; the unapologetic innocent nature of proceedings suggests this is\naimed squarely at the toddler demographic, yet the Godfather and\n'Breaking Bad' references are directly at odds with this. The\ninfectiously optimistic bunny at the movie's heart, Judy Hopps\n(Ginnifer Goodwin), is a sweet and likable protagonist, however the\nmischievous fox who partners with Hopps, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman),\nhas more depth and charisma. A lower-rung Disney effort with a\ngratingly obvious agenda, Zootopia hints at brilliance but\nfrustratingly falls way short.\n"},
{"review": "\nA great example of how didactism bores rather than inspires,\nregurgitates rather than re-imagines. There's a clear political\nmessage, and the unabashed way which it is presented won't change any\nminds, but at the least may spark political debate. Though its singular\ntreatment preaching the current \"hip\" left-wing social platforms\nwithout nuance does nothing to elucidate any new ideas or attempt to\nshed new truths on issues that allow people to re-evaluate their\ncurrent ideological stances. As such, its effect is similar to that of\nthe person talking politics at the cocktail party who relies on volume\nrather than substance in order to bolster their (or more accurately\ntheir party's) talking points.<br><br>All in all, though there are some witty scenes and stereotypical\nromance &amp; coming of age story lines, the overpowering pedantic verbal\ndiarrhea exposes it as a thinly veiled political commercial rather than\na great piece of art. The ratings, therefore, represent the extent to\nwhich the audience agrees with its sermon rather than recognizes its\ndegree of unbiased (with respect to 21st century American politics)\naesthetic merit.\n"},
{"review": "\nI thought that Disney couldn't get any better, but with Zootopia, yeah.\nThe characters were awesome from Nick Wilde to Judy Hopps (etc.). It\ngave this movie a more fun and positive charm. This movie also had good\nvoice acting like Jason Bateman as Nick, I couldn't see anybody be\nvoice acting Nick. This movie had some negative vibes like racism.<br><br>And Disney hid those messages very limited but well. The animation was\ngreat and you can tell it's advancing. This movie was good and that's\nit. This movie could be the start of the evolution of the modern\nDisney. And it's amazing definitely recommend seeing this in a theater\nor rent on Hulu or Redbox.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis was an average movie. The plot of the movie was clever and took\nseveral turns that kept the movie from becoming too predictable.\nHowever, there were a slew of underlying messages throughout this\nmovie. The biggest subliminal message that I noticed in the movie was\nthrough the character of the fox. He was depicted as someone who could\nnot help the situation that he was in because of something that\nhappened to him when he was younger. I question this message and I\nwonder, besides American culture pushing this idea, if there is any\nreason to why this has become a prevalent idea of our culture. I also\nwonder what effect this message has on the young viewers who watch this\nmovie.\n"},

{"review": "\nZootopia is an easy movie to describe. That's neither a compliment nor\na criticism, but for the most part this is a pretty straight forward\nmovie. It's about an underdog who rises up to the top (after facing\nmany difficulties, of course); we follow this underdog - Hopper - as\nshe investigates the case of a missing person - a case which get larger\nand larger as the movie goes on. It follows a very standard formula\n(the storytelling technique is nothing more than the cop finds the\nfirst clue, which leads to second clue, which leads to third clue, etc,\nuntil eventually they find the big bad villain). It probably sounds\nfamiliar as this is the basic storyline to most detective movies,\nespecially animated ones. But instead of conforming to complete\nconventionality as you might it would, Zootopia boosts itself by adding\nin some refreshingly new ideas for such a movie. It's a movie with a\nvaluable message laid out throughout, about not stereotyping or\nlabelling people, and looking past outward appearances. Although it\ndebatable gets a little too preachy at times, you still have to commend\nthe movie for trying to teach the younger end of the audience a very\nvaluable lesson.<br><br>The movie never quite hits any of those belly-laugh moments that you\noften find in a Pixar movie (although one particular scene with a sloth\nis hilarious), but the humour is good enough to keep older audiences\nentertained, although most of the humour would certainly work better\nwith a child. The voicing casting is on-point and the movie never\nreally gets dull, so this is sure to entertain all of the family - just\nas an animated movie should do.\n"},

In this movie everything is good as always as\nexpected from Disney except songs I think this movie songs are not as\ngood as in other Disney movies. So, besides this everything is great.\nIn the movie they tried to show whatever humans do that are doing by\nanimal means human are not there only animals and animals are\npretending to be human. So they very nicely put everything all together\nand show it as what they are. As giraffe, rat, lion, sheep, rabbit\netc., predators, non-predators working together that the best part for\nme and I really think that director also take too much time how to put\nall of them together. The movie starts with rabbit want to become\npolice officer before this no one in rabbit ever become police officer\nso they showed it as challenge. So, after she cleared the police\nacademy exam she joined the police force as in police force they also\nunderestimated her and her boss did not give her the job what she like\ninstead she got the meter maid job. So, in the city some people are\nmissing somehow she got the job for finding those people. Then real\nstory of the movie starts and you have to watch this movie.

There are some\npretty big plot holes, like how did they not hear the wolves howling in\nthe panther scene? How did they cut in front of the entire DMV? Also\ntowards the end the movie seems to give up and just give away all the\nremaining mysteries as easily as it can in the narratively weakest way\npossible.

On other occasions, however, the experience can\nbe joyful. I went into this film with low expectations, and\nunexpectedly had a ball. I honestly found it laugh-out-loud funny, and\nso did my kids. Moreover, we often laughed at the same scene for\ndifferent reasons. My kids have never seen the Godfather, for instance,\nand neither have they (yet) had to deal with a government department\nwhose speed of service would be improved by replacing everyone with\nsloths - but there were elements in these scenes which worked for them\nas well as the bits that worked for me.

The only thing they could have done without was all the\nheavy handed social satire in reference to marginalized races or\ncultures (in this case, the predators) being grouped together based on\njust a few instances. This movie does contain and even hinge on some\nmature themes for a kids movie. For instance, officer Hopps gets Nick\nWilde to help her because of \"fellony tax evasion.\" I'm sure every 8\nyear old who went to see this with there parents understood fully why\nNick went along with Hopps.

{"review": "\nZootopia promises to entertain you right from the beginning till the\nend. This is probably one of those rare times when Disney has taken a\nshot on suspense and it has done brilliantly well on it. <br><br>Story (10/10): Full marks to the story which is probably the most\nprofound story I have seen after Inside Out. Zootopia talks about the\nstruggles of the only bunny cop - Judy Hopps - town has, and the\nchallenges she faces while performing her duties due to various\nstereotypes. It is very hard to stay put against the disgust and\nbullying of everyone, which is beautifully depicted through Judy Hopps\ncharacterization. The writer has created a complete contrast character,\nNick Wilde, a fox, who gives up against those same stereotypes. He,\nironically, helps her in solving the case involving mysterious turn of\nevents in the city. The story has very interesting twists and turns\nalmost every now and then which keeps you wondering what will happen\nnext. The other characters like Chief Bogo, Bellweather, Bonnie and Stu\nHopps are very well conceptualized where they all are bound by their\npreconceived notions, ambitions and greed that pretty much is a\nmicrocosm of what Zootopia town has been. <br><br>Animation (8/10): The level of animation has been good. The creativity\nthat went behind projecting the city and its various facets is\noutstanding. Although Hollywood has moved slightly ahead but Zootopia\nstay puts. <br><br>Direction (9/10): The trio of Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush\nhave done a great job in keeping the story moving and bringing in\ntwists and turns all the time which keeps the audience glued to their\nseats. Bringing in Shakira for the song, \"Try Everything\" and the\nnovelty in the end credits is simply brilliant. <br><br>Overall (9/10): Overall, it is a very refreshing movie which brings in\nsomething brand new from Disney. A must watch for everyone.\n"},

{"review": "\n'ZOOTOPIA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br><br>The 55th feature film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. This one\nrevolves around a world of anthropomorphic animals; where a cop bunny\nteams with a con artist fox, to solve a missing animal case. It was\ndirected by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, and co-directed by Jared Bush\n(the trio also co-wrote the movie, with 5 other writers). The film\nstars the voice talents of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba,\nJ.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Octavia Spencer and Tommy\nChong. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and I\nhave to agree; it's one of the best films of the year (so far)!<br><br>Judy Hopps (Goodwin) had always dreamed of becoming the first rabbit\npolice officer (since childhood). When her dreams finally come true,\nshe's assigned to work at the Zootopia police department. Zootopia is a\nlarge metropolis; of all kinds of different mammals. Judy is (of\ncourse) initially met with a lot of skepticism (and prejudice). She\ntries to prove herself, by solving a missing otter case. She teams up\nwith a clever con artist fox, named Nick Wilde (Bateman), in order to\ndo so. <br><br>The film is beautifully animated, and full of colorful (likable)\ncharacters. It's both funny and surprisingly touching; but what's most\nbeautiful about the movie, is it's insightful message about bigotry.\nYou can never judge anyone by their appearance, or social background,\nand what better way to illustrate that message to kids; than with a\nworld full of various types of animals. I love this movie, because of\nthat message (it's one that means a lot to me), and I don't usually\nlove Disney animated films. This one is pretty important.<br><br>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:\nhttps://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U\n"},

So we\ndid last night and this is the second good film I have seen this year.\nNotice I didn't use the words \"good cartoon\"?<br><br>The world of Zootopia is so meticulously designed with its own logic\nthat mirrors our societies. I came out feeling that it is a world that\nis built on metaphors and it is a real place. The emotional beats are\nspot on and pitch perfect. Thematically, this is strong. Its themes of\nempowerment and the dangers of stereotyping so timely and so\neffortlessly delivered. Unlike all the other typical Disney cartoons,\nthis latest outing is never preachy and laden with so many rapid\nspitfire puns. We laughed ourselves silly at so many inventive scenes\nand the unlikely friendship moved us. <br><br>This one has more layers than a rainbow cake.

{"review": "\nBasic story summary badly written by me: A rabbit named Judy Hopps has\ndreamed her whole life of becoming a police officer in the city of\nZootopia. Part of her dream of working in Zootopia is for her to live\nin a place where she isn't judged based on what animal she is, which is\nwhat she had experienced in her childhood on the countryside. After\nbeing excluded from a case involving missing animals at her job and\nassigned to parking duty instead she soon realizes that things were not\nquite as she imagined in the city. In her own investigation into the\ncase of the missing animals, Judy herself starts to question if there\nis some legitimacy or not to whether different animals are inherently\ndifferent from each other.<br><br>Disney movies are good movies. It is as simple as that. Zootopis does\nhowever NOT do anything groundbreaking, and not even anything\nparticularly new. Using animals as a way to portray differences between\ncharacters is nothing new, using animals as characters is nothing new,\nthe humour is GOOD but nothing extraordinary, the story itself is\nnothing special, and the moral of the story is, again- nothing new.<br><br>The movie doesn't do anything bad, the movie is overall good and fine.\nThe characters are good and many of them pretty funny. The story is\ngood even if it is nothing new, and it is mostly catered to children.<br><br>If anything, i would say that the whole moral message about peoples\nequal value (or whatever) often feels a bit too forced, and that the\nfilmmakers at times tried too hard with it.<br><br>I don't really understand how this has gotten almost perfect scores\nfrom critics. There is nothing groundbreaking here, but it is a solid\nmovie.

{"review": "\nThe movie is well animated and there were a few lines that made me\nlaugh but overall the movie fails to deliver on it's liberal and\nmulticulturalist message.

There is a reason they segregate the animals at real zoos, if\nyou mixed them together you would have zoopocalyspe not zootopia. So\nthe metaphor fails in that it is promoting values that are unnatural.<br><br>The fox character lives up to his stereotype but then the movie comes\nup with a very contrived reason for this that isn't very believable.\nThe explanation in why the predators \"revert back to their nature\" is\neven more absurd rather than just to accept the truth, that they are\npredators and it's in their nature to behave that way.<br><br>The funniest part of the movie is the sloths in the DMV. Here the movie\ngoes off it's message and comes up with a great metaphor for anybody\nwho has had to deal with idiots promoted into jobs via affirmative\naction.<br><br>The movie would have been hilarious if they would have changed a few\nthings and made it a parody.\n"},

{"review": "\nZootopia is among if not the most notable animated film to be released\nthis year. For actually analyzing it critically, it continues Disney's\ntrend of selling us non-sleazy animation that gives us messages and\nthings to give thought in addition to simple comedy. The comedy is\nrather blowout and, despite seeming like it contradicts its message,\nends up giving us more perspectives on the matter. The plot, in\naddition to the comedy, is not only organized, but provides\nnon-preached messages that would be unheard of in most family animation\ntoday for its maturity. Among these are anti- discrimination and\nanti-prejudice, with hints of anti-corruption by our \"protagonist\",\nJudy Hopps. Besides Hopps, the characters are ones that can be\ncherished by all audiences, from little children to their grandparents.\nThey either provide wonderful comedy or have us think about what is\noccurring in our world. I am writing this just as the United States is\ngetting over the election of Donald Trump, whose campaign has been\nmarred by the very same things this movie speaks out against. I am\nstill hopeful that we can preserve our more-than-great nation with\nmessages like the ones in Zootopia.

{"review": "\nThe animated film, Zootopia, is a heartwarming tale made to teach young\naudiences about the importance of acceptance, perseverance, and\nfriendship in our society.

The film is a much needed break if you are searching for an\nentertaining yet appropriate movie for both you and kids, then Zootopia\nwould be a perfect choice for you. At first, the plot line of Zootopia\nmay just like many other children's movies that have already been\nreleased. 'Two unlikely animals defy social stereotypes and become\nfriends anyway' is something that both you and I have probably seen a\nmillion times before. But, when watching Zootopia, the plot is somehow\ncompletely different than things that I have seen before. Firstly,\nthere are subtle references to popular culture, that most kids would\ngenerally not understand. The character Walter White, from Breaking\nBad, was probably the most obvious one, probably included in order to\nkeep adults and teenage generations interested. Secondly, the plot line\nis a bit more complex than many other children's movie, and the plot\nhas much more to it than the relationship between the two friends. Plot\ntwist, after plot twist, this movie has you thinking constantly, making\nthe ending far from predictable. Overall, Zootopia is a great,\ninspiring movie that, although aimed toward younger generations, can be\nthoroughly enjoyed by people of all ages.\n"},

After the first few minutes I was intrigued.\nSome of my favorite parts were the reference to the classic 1972 film\n\"The Godfather\". I also like how this movie is packed with life\nlessons. This is usually the norm for Disney movies but this one brings\nan interesting point considering its only animals. Without giving to\nmuch away, this film basically teaches you to chase your dreams no\nmatter who tells you its unattainable. To live your life free and to be\nopen to different cultures and experiences. This movie has a great\ntheme and story line. Its easy to stay with and an overall enjoyable\nfilm for the entire family. If there was one thing in this movie that I\ncould change, it would most likely be giving the main character Judy\nHopps at least one person that believed in her. She had not a single\nperson in her corner until the movie progresses.<br><br>Some significant cinematography were close ups and aerial shots when\nJudy begins to spy on her witness. Scenes that start behind the\nshoulder just as seen in the godfather. Some Diegetic sound is\nincorporated, especially in the opening credits and the scene where the\nanimal citizens get of the train in Zootopia.\n"},
{"review": "\nIn a large city of animals, one would expect many problems to arise,\nseeing as they have stark differences about them. The huge metropolis\nbeing divided into sections, the tundra, rain-forest, desert etc.\nallows animals to live where they need in order to survive, however\nthere are two themes presented throughout the entirety of the movie.\nThe first being a predator-prey relationship they strive to put behind\nthem, Zootopia also presents the issue that if you were born a certain\nanimal, you were expected to behave in a certain way/pursue a certain\npath in life. This is presented head on when Bunny Judy Hopps is\nintroduced. Although she is expected to be a carrot farmer, she\ndedicates her life to being a police officer. She is then presented\nwith the challenging question that seems to be taking everyone by\nstorm. Does being a predator truly make an animal a more\nviolent/untrustworthy citizen? With a sly predator by her side, will\nshe be able to debunk this question? The film Zootopia has a positive\nmessage as it pushes the idea that no matter who you are, you can\nachieve whatever you want as long as you have the passion for it.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's a really nice movie, kids like it, and if you're a little older.\nyou could see some life lessons in this movie. Parents should watch\nthis movie with their kids I really loved the concept of a bunny that\nfinds her sort as good as other animals, because i've never seen that\nbefore. Even though the rest of the animals think that a bunny can't do\nanything good as a police officer, she will prove it. i just love that.\nIt's cool that a bunny and a fox can be friends after the fox had stole\nsomething and she was a police officer. Disney did a great job once\nagain. You should give it a try, i bet you will like it and see the\nlife lessons of the movie.\n"},

{"review": "\nI'll admit that a spunky hero pursuing her dreams in spite of the odds\nis pretty much half of the cartoons out there. And yet, this one seemed\nto do more with the story. I was engaged by Judy's seemingly ridiculous\ndetermination to overcome prejudice and biology to follow her dream.\nUsing a world of animals to call out racism and suspicion of \"the\nother\" was ingenious and well handled. And the central mystery was\ngenuinely intriguing. Often spunky heroines and clue solving feel like\nsimply a hanger off of which to hang the jokes, but it feels like more\nthan that here.<br><br>And the same time, the movie does have those jokes and clever concepts.\nThere is in particularly a fabulous use of scale involved in a world in\nwhich giant giraffes and elephants life in the same city as mice, with\ndifferent neighborhoods built for their occupants.<br><br>I found this movie funny, touching, and intelligent, and yet there is\nalso something rather slight about it. <br><br>There is something about this movie that makes me somewhat articulate.\nI can't quite explain why I was more affected by the story than that of\ndozens of other overcoming-the-odds movies, and I also can't quite\nexplain what subtle something was missing that prevents me from giving\nit a higher score (I was torn between 8 &amp; 9). But it's a terrific\nmovie.\n"},
{"review": "\nZootopia is a revolutionary and meaningful animation blockbuster from\nDisney. the story line follows bouncy Judy Hopps (see what I did\nthere)on her journey to animal mega-city Zootopia where she teams up\nwith the sly and cunning nick Wilde, together they help each other\novercome their challenges and solve the Night Howler Case.<br><br>I found this movie inspiration due to its reflection to its real world\nviews covering racism, Drug troubles and sexism. the movie marks\nDisney's first use of applying their revolutionary new hair engine\nwhich allows the movies characters to be seen in a more unique and\ndetailed way then ever before. the plot could have been extended but\nconsidering this the story line was still gripping and I am sure has\ninspired many furries and has turned many people into furries\nthemselves (including me) I highly recommend this movie to any Disney\nfan or anyone looking for a brilliant movie to sit down and fall in\nlove with.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe best animation I've seen in s long time. Brilliant plot twists and\nturn. Brilliant characters Virtually no sex, violence etc Only one\nslightly slightly scary scene but it was well suited and helped to keep\nthe attention of its audience. The overall tale is unusual and is\nbrilliant even for teen and adults. I've rated it a 9/10. Can't wait\nfor number 2 to appear! Come on Disney- try and top this one! This is\none of the best animations for the whole family to watch. My family has\ntwo males and both enjoyed , they said, and I quote \" Was quite good,\ninteresting plots!\" So honestly, I definitely recommend for anyone\nwanting a family animation to watch for a change. Wou.d say that this\nis. A comedy/Very Slight Crime/ Very Slight Action. \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\n"},
{"review": "\nZootopia is a great surprise this year for me , I expected more\nliveliest for a good laugh and so , the more this film is more than\nthat , it has a great message , the characters are great , I enjoyed\nthe Hopps , one of the best character of the year, the rabbit , the\nvoice cast is very good, Ginnifer Goodwin , Jason Bateman , Idris Elba\n, Jenny Slate, JK Simmons , Nate Torrance, Bonnie Hunt , Tommy Chong\nand etc , the script is good , the film is full of great characters ,\nplus some are kind of boring , I do not really liked Nick Wilde fox ,\nthe film has funny moments , the scene of laziness is really fun , the\nsoundtrack is good, and the last are really cool , just like the movie\nall , Zootopia is one of the best films of the year , surely will\ncompete for the Oscar for best Animated Feature of the year. Note 8.6\n"},
{"review": "\nI am absolutely sure Zootopia Will Be Number 1 In All Countries Of The\nWorld Without Any Exaggeration.<br><br>Walt Disney Pictures clearly delivers a useful moral of\nlove,unity,integrity and peace of mind.<br><br>since Judy is brainy and has a strong will to be a successful cop,she\nmade a deal with a sly fox to get what she wants.<br><br>When the genius and the yummy bunny Judy became a policewoman,she was\nso just and confident in dealing with other animals and soon she\nreceives all the estimation from all the animals including the\npreviously prejudiced animals who underestimated it.\n"}
