{"review": "\nDespite an initial action scene full of CGI that you can also\nexperience in the trailer, this movie hasn't got too much to offer.<br><br>The main problem is the bad script and dialogs and the pretentious\nstyle which tries to keep the tradition of older Bond films\nincorporating some not-so-witty and clich\u00e9 humor and ludicrous action\nsequences with nothing new to offer. Planes, helicopters, cars...Well\nwe've seen it all before and in much better executions.<br><br>Also Blofeld (or should I say BLOWfeld), despite the fact he is the\nKing of all previous villains, seems quite harmless.<br><br>Casino Royale (2006) is far more entertaining (I've watched it again\nrecently) and engaging. Spectre is \"Meh!\" in almost every department\nincluding (unfortunately) the ladies.<br><br>Thomas Newman who serves as the composer of the film, is proved to be a\nbad decision too. At the beginning he tries to revive the good-old 007\ntheme in almost every scene and the outcome is sub-par to say the\nleast. Later he replaces the music with the same note again and again\n(da-da-da-da-da-da-da). David Arnold did a great job in C.R. and should\nhave been the composer in this too (although I doubt that he could save\nthis movie).<br><br>And what's the deal with this lame song? Unsuitable for a Bond movie or\nany movie out there. Same goes for the same-o same-o intro sequence.\nThe combination of these 2 makes it look like it was made by Liberace.<br><br>Overall: The whole movie is pale like the Pale King it mentions.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is the worst Bond movie ever, filled with emotionless characters\nthat I couldn't care less about. The pace of this film after a\npredictably exciting start is slow and boring. Unlike his fellow\nactors, Ben Whishaw as Q manages to portray the only believable human\nin this whole fake production. Why couldn't JB have been given a touch\nof Q's wit, humour or vulnerability? No wonder Daniel Craig wants out\nof this franchise - it's beneath his talent. Such a cacophony of\ntotally forgettable dialogue, people and silly stunts is hard to\nimagine in a single movie and yet here it is. During one of the\n'action' fights when James was being hammered by the evil assassin I\nnoticed the person next to me had fallen asleep and was snoring. That\nperson was an exceedingly eloquent critic.\n"},

We all know this is not a documentary, but when Bond / Craig get\npummeled by the bad guy on the train and his tie stays in place and he\nsuffers not a scratch or a black eye where is the realism...The\nIslander aircraft flying with its wings clipped outboard of the\nengines?????.Come on Broccoli team - is this the best you can do? Sean\nConnery is rolling his eyes and chuckling at the new low in Bond\nmovies. Wasted evening, could have snoozed on a couch instead of a\nmovie theater.

{"review": "\nReviewers notes humbly submitted: <br><br>1. This reviewer not only watched all the Sean Connery movies in\ntheatres but read all the novels too. Does that date me? <br><br>2. The Biography Channel Special on Ian Fleming portrayed him as an\nageing indolent frat boy who wrote his novels using a typewriter on the\nbeach using the two finger method while cavorting. Hard to believe such\ninnocent beginnings led to a franchise that just will not die.<br><br>3. Speaking of franchises, Hollywood is running out. Which is why\nStallone was able to raise the cash to turn his C-rated Expendables\nseries into an A level franchise. And why Fast and Furious -- which\nstarted out as a drama script not a special effects gimmick -- is the\nnew Mission Impossible. So, against this backdrop, if you are going to\ndo Bond, you do it big. At least that is what the producers thought. At\n2 and half hours, however, the audience starts to wonder if .. maybe\n... less is more? <br><br>4. Craig is good. Probably the best Bond since Sean. If only the\nwriters and producers could support him the way he deserves.<br><br>5. The first reboot with Craig was the best, remains the best. The\nsecond was horrid. The bizarre entry which took place in his childhood\nhome in the English countryside -- the one where a classic car was\ngratuitously machine-gunned for no obvious reason -- almost killed the\nfranchise completely. This entry -- essentially a mishmash of Dr. No\nand the old Mannix TV show with a dollop of modern political\ncorrectness thrown in -- is OK, but will never make it to brilliant.<br><br>6. Times change, years pass. The gold standard for this sort of movie\nis the Damon/Bourne series, even more ironic because (so far) that\nfranchise remains in limbo. The first reboot here was a close\ncompetitor. So far, no other instalment in this series has even come\nclose.\n"},

In the previous Craig films, they did a good\njob of using ancillary characters like M, Q and Moneypenny to augment\nhis character so that that his missions seemed logically paced and not\nsolely center on his prowess alone. They deviated from the traditional\nBond by allowing him to have Blonde hair, who had a an experience worn\nface and body that did break down from wear and tear, who was detail\noriented and mission driven. <br><br>While this film still tried to keep to it's current trend, it reverted\nback to just stupid unrealistic scenes, like Bond shooting SMG's with\none hand from 200 yards out and saying clever one liners like \"You're\nbluffing,\" I lost track of how many helicopters were used in this film.\nHow many times was bond apprehended and somehow able to break his\n'bonds' from his captors and escape the villain's carefully planned\nexotic methods of execution? And it was 2.5 hours long; plus the\nediting made no sense of how they got from point A to point B. They\ncould've at least had the villains die in extreme and weird ways, but\nno, a total let down even on that point. <br><br>This is a first time I've written a review and encouraged the audience\nmembers not to see this film. It reminds me the Die Another Day film\nwith Pierce Bronson which was terrible, but they squeezed it in because\nhe only had one film left on his contract. Forgivable, Yes, but I hope\nthe producers have something better for the next Bond film seeing as\nthey are pacing these releases 2.5 years apart, which a tight deadline.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is the first James Bond film I have seen with Craig in it. I liked\nsome of the old classics, but did not think that Bond brand should\ncontinue forever.

And I was not disappointed, just these scenes alone were worth the\nprice of admission for me. I have to admit that I hate to watch\nviolence, so I spent quite some time in the movie not watching. But I\nalso laughed on several occasions, some of the Bond brand is so retro\nand it took me back a few decades. I enjoyed the trip around the world\nand was entertained, but for the fight scenes. Obviously they cannot\ncome up with new ideas to improve the Aston Martin, so this time the\ncar was mainly good for a long and sometimes spectacular chase.\nSpectacular were also the helicopter stunts.

{"review": "\nI was finding it incredibly hard to stay awake through this movie. Even\nthe action scenes were quite lacklustre.

In between the\naction scenes there were intense periods of nothingness. It's not\nsurprising really as there was no real plot. I just cannot watch a\nmindless film about fighting, explosions and getting laid when there's\nno passion.<br><br>Speaking of passion the \"bond girls\" were a big disappointment and had\nno connection with Bond.

Craig, with his\ntremendous physicality, and almost sociopathic detachment:\nbrutal,clever, doggedly following all the leads, was frigging awesome.\nJust watch the first scene, shot in black and white, tilted frame,\nbeautifully paced, and a great script, to see what Bond could be.

I flinched when i heard\nhim sing \"How do i live, how do i breathe.\" This is James Bond we are\ntalking about!!!<br><br>2) James Bond falls in love, again. This time the characters had\nabsolutely no chemistry to one another.<br><br>3) The car chase scene was nothing more than shots of the Aston Martin\ndriving through the beautiful lights of Rome. <br><br>4) After the opening credits the movie just fell completely flat. <br><br>5) Daniel Craig looked as though he was half asleep playing Bond; and\nthat he was only doing this for his large paycheck. (he even stated in\nan interview that he needed a break from playing 007)<br><br>6) With such a special cast they completely underused Monica Bellucci\nand Christoph Waltz. <br><br>7) Sam Mendes is an amazing director who has won an Oscar from\ndirecting \"American Beauty.\" But clearly he does not know how to direct\nan action film. (That's right, i also think that the action in Skyfall\nsucked) - my conclusion, get Martin Campbell back who directed two of\nthe most entertaining Bond Films \"Casino Royale\" and \"GoldenEye\".<br><br>Conclusion: Get a new actor to play James Bond who has the fire and\nenthusiasm to take the role into another level. Bring Martin Campbell\nback or another Director who understands the 007 formula.\n"},

It isn't just nice\nsuits, and cars with beautiful woman surrounded by flying bullets in\nfront of the canvas of a massive explosion (even if this film does\nboast the record for the largest stunt explosion in movie history). No,\nthis movie gives us some nice character development. With a nod to the\nmany years of Bond that has preceded Craig.

The only\ndownside I could see anyone pointing out with this film is maybe the\nlength of the film. This film could be reviewed as a rather long one,\nespecially to those who might lose interest trying to involve\nthemselves in a story that started back in the days of Connery.

He did it again.<br><br>'Spectre' will definitely appeal more to those who were fans of the\nearly films in the franchise, most notably 'You Only Live Twice' whose\ninspiration brings back one of the finest villains to ever face Bond.\nMendes has since seemed to take a new direction on Craig's series of\nfilms and led away from the gritty, thriller aspect that 'Casino\nRoyale' and 'Skyfall' had and instead propelled the film as an action\nspectacle, full of beautifully orchestrated stunts, stunning\ncinematography and non-stop explosive action. The locations are\nstunning, the score is exhilarating and the cinematography from Hoyte\nVan Hoytema is dazzling.<br><br>Christoph Waltz and Dave Bautista, whoever the casting director was on\nthis film, you deserve a huge pat on the back, this film stars two of\nthe most perfect actors to plays villains ever. The much-loved Austrian\nWaltz whose Colonel Hans Landa has earned him recognition as a\nfantastic and plausible villain, and ex-wrestler Bautista proving that\nhe is one person not to screw with.<br><br>'Spectre' manages to reflect back upon its predecessors in the\nfranchise with references to prior villains, allies and lovers, further\ndrawing upon a story that was in need of a conclusion, a conclusion all\nfans just couldn't wait for. But... will 'Spectre' be the conclusion we\nexpected? Or will there be more to follow from Daniel Craig and 007?<br><br>Obviously you don't have to take my word for it, I'm just a mega- Bond\nfan, but allow me to shed some light upon it if you are having a hard\ntime deciding whether to see it or not? I went and saw this in IMAX - I\nwas blown away. This is the ultimate British action film and one of the\nfinest instalments!\n"},
{"review": "\nSpectre follows James Bond after the events of Skyfall as he hunts down\nyet another villain. Meanwhile the 00 agent program is being\nthreatened. <br><br>As expected, Daniel Craig is a great James Bond. L\u00e9a Seydoux, who plays\nthe latest Bond lady, does a great job as well. <br><br>The action was also solid. While it wasn't horribly realistic, it was\nfun. And that's what action should be. <br><br>However, the movie does have it's flaws. Christoph Waltz as the main\nvillain sounds great, right? Everyone remembers him in Inglourious\nBasterds right? He was great. Not so much in this movie. He really only\nhad a handful of scenes, but he just played Christoph Waltz in those\nscenes, he wasn't really the villain. He didn't pull off a great\nperformance, he was just fine. Furthermore, him as a villain was kind\nof anti-climatic. He just popped in once in a while, but didn't really\ndo anything. <br><br>All the other Daniel Craig Bond movies have taken an original twist on\nthe secret agent genre, but this one really didn't. It was classic\nBond, and while that isn't a bad thing it isn't a good thing either. It\nnever strayed too far from the formula, so it kind of stands out from\nthe rest of the series as less exceptional. Going back to the villain,\nhe was just another classic Bond villain. Maybe Waltz just didn't have\nenough to work with, I don't know. <br><br>On top of that, Bond and his love interest didn't have a lot of\nrelationship development or chemistry, yet they still fell in love. It\nwas treated like this big deal, but I just didn't buying it. <br><br>Overall Spectre was, despite all the negativity I expressed, still\ngood. I had a good time, everything was in place for the most part,\nsome stuff just didn't work as well as it could have. Yes, it was a\ndisappointment, but that doesn't make it bad. In the end I'd recommend\nthis movie to fans of the Daniel Craig Bond movies. Although you might\nas well watch it anyway if you've seen the others.\n"},

{"review": "\nSpectre is an amazing film.Daniel Craig once more is a fantastic 007 in\nhis fourth appearance.Sam Mendes has directed a thrilling film and\ndeserves a huge amount of credit because his target was to better\nSkyfall and he has succeeded without doubt.Dr Madeleine Swann is a\nmagnificent Bond girl as she is highly intelligent and very\nattractive.Dave Bautista is an extremely physical henchman and the\ntrain fight is brutal,bringing back memories of the train fight in From\nRussia With Love(1963).Franz Oberhauser who is portrayed by Christoph\nWaltz is unbelievable in the film and is no doubt my favorite Bond\nvillain.It's very clever how Sam Mendes has tied together the previous\nthree films in to the film.Also the films ties together memories from\nthe earlier films which is brilliant.The beginning of the film is\nextremely entertaining and is also throughout.The countries that are\nused in the film are very exotic and fantastic.M,Q,Tanner &amp; Moneypenny\nalso deserve credit for their appearances.The theme song makes sense\nonce you've seen the film.The beginning of the film in Mexico is very\nentertaining.The ending is also fantastic.I can't wait for the 25th\nBond to come out in the future.In my opinion this is the best Bond film\nin history.I hope Daniel Craig will once more portray 007 and that Sam\nMendes will direct it.A truly excellent film - 10/10.\n"},

{"review": "\nIn \"Spectre\" Craig ends after his previous work as \"Bond\", absorbing\nand fun. If \"Skyfall\" was sober and serious, \"Spectre\" is the opposite\nbrother: fun, entertaining, absurd and glorious in its purposes. More\ntraditional with the classic Bond scheme and Daniel Craig giving a new\ndimension in character: one that can continue playing as only he knows,\nbut also giving it an air of relaxation, accommodation in the role and\nadventure. He looks mature and adult, changed after all these years,\nand their missions. They are no longer so dirty and rough as at the\nbeginning, but elegant and tidy.<br><br>The story does not have the groundbreaking surprise \"Royale\" or\ndepression dirty \"Solace\", nor the depth of \"Skyfall\". But it has the\nenjoyment that there was in all of them. Bond has the experienced and\ngallant who was not in those. It has the classic James Bond was not\nthere.<br><br>The pace is very good, the action never exceeds the sequence of Mexico\nDF but still stellar, music accompanies very well and even the\ndiscourse on (perhaps the deepest part of it) hovers monitoring the\nfilm. \"Spectre\" is the most dynamic and fun Craig as Bond film.\n"},

We had a film based around one of the best\nknown criminal organisations in the form of Spectre and one of Bond's\nmost iconic villains in the form of Blofeld. Here is my first problem;\nI felt Waltz was a good choice to play Blofeld but he is seriously\nunderused. Dave Bautista actually gets more screen time, or at least it\nfeels like he does.<br><br>What I feel really let down by is the premise that the previous three\nfilms are somehow tied together but in order for that to happen the\naudience needs to be able to look back and go 'Oh, yes'. Instead we\nhave a standalone film with very little, if anything, that made me\nthink back to the earlier films. For me this was a lazy film, albeit\nwith some nice action sequences but if I want a brainless action film I\nwill go back and watch an old JCVD or Steven Segal movie.<br><br>In fairness this film is better than Quantum of Solace but it spends a\nlot of time building up the plot and very little time resolving a lot\nof issues.\n"},

This film explains the entire series and shows\nBond accepting a change in life path. There is no need for continuance\nafter this wonderful film.<br><br>The Three Acts:<br><br>The initial tableaux: The film starts in Mexico City in a grand public\nDay of the Dead celebration. Bond seems to be enjoying himself, but\nsoon is in direct pursuit of an enemy. When he returns to London, M\nlets him know that his actions were not appreciated, that he will be\nunder observation, and that the double oh section is in danger of being\nshut down.<br><br>Delineation of conflicts: C (head of the new organization Centre of\nNational Security) wants to shut down the double oh section; M wants to\nkeep it open. Bond wants to honor the postmortem wishes of the previous\nM. SPECTRE wants strong control of almost all information flow in the\nworld, so as to have more power and to make more money. C wants that\nflow to be available to UK intelligence to replace older methodology,\nlike MI6. Q, M, Tanner, Moneypenny, and Bond would like to preserve\neach other as well as some traditional British approaches to\ncivilization and intelligence. C and SPECTRE are clearly opposed, and\nseem to have the upper hand during most of the film. Bond's foster\nbrother wants to make Bond fully aware of how much he hates him.<br><br>Resolution: Bond has an opportunity to be his better self; does he take\nit?\n"},
{"review": "\nIt must have been easy for all the actors involved to learn their\nlines, there weren't that many, it was all action and very little\ndialogue.<br><br>James Bond was a product of the fifties, stories written by a man who\nhad lived the spy life in the forties so knew what he was talking\nabout. The Connery years were without doubt the best as they were set\nint the time of the novels, I've read them, in the sixties, all by the\nway. The character of this a the most recent films is not a of that\nperiod so the only connection to James Bond is his name, M and Q\notherwise it could be any spy movie.<br><br>Now they are talking about having a black Bond or even worst a female,\nWhaaaaat? Bond is a naval commander of the 40's/50's and would have\nbeen neither. This just PC gone mad.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, the film is very entertaining, fab special effects\nbut little story or good dialogue. Some good performances, especially\nRalph Finnes and Rory Kinnear, the females being instantly forgettable,\nespecially the now PC Miss Moneypenny. Daniel Craig is Daniel Craig,\nneither good or bad, just average.<br><br>So if they want to make a fab Bond movie go back and read the Flemming\nnovels and set it in the 50's or 60's when there was a cold war. Write\na good story, and there have been some books, eg, Colonel Sun by the\nwonderful Kingsley Amis would be perfect. And get someone with the sex\nappeal and humour of Connery.\n"},
{"review": "\nI love the Bond movies and I realize that it must be difficult to\nsupercede the previous films, but this may be the worst Bond film yet.\nPerhaps it is because they feel pressured to \"out do\" the previous film\nand they can't come up with good ideas. But I think the writing is very\nbad on this one. Daniel Craig is brilliant as Bond but here I think the\nwriting has him stepping out of character in a few places, making Bond\nappear stupid and incompetent. Even the special effects were a bit\nlame. This must have been a low budget production. There is no real\nclosure or viewer satisfaction provided. The producers, and especially\nthe writers, should be ashamed of what they have done to the legacy of\nJames Bond!\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat I liked from a couple of last Bond movies was they were off the\nregular 007 style, like not overly rely on spy's special gadgets. This\nchange has been since the day one of Daniel Craig as a famous British\nspy, James Bond. Anyway, he's the most fittest (muscular) Bond I've\never seen and he's celebrating 10 year anniversary with this film\nrelease. But the question is whether he to do another film or done with\nthe franchise. The doubt after the confusing end of this film.<br><br>The end was quite clear on the story perspective, so I kind of felt it\nwas a farewell for Craig. But, later I came to know that the official\nsource says Bond25 will be his fifth and so on till he opts out\nhimself. 'Spectre' was a very simple Bond movie I have ever seen, but I\ncan say the production quality was so good that you can't resist the\nenjoyment. The actors, they were also good, but not as I anticipated.\nMaybe many scenes were very ordinary for a Bond movie, that's\ncomparable with the nowadays action movies, otherwise it was not as bad\nas critics expressing their disappointment.<br><br>You can't believe what I was disappointed, you know when they say what\nthe C stands for - is that the best word they come up with against the\nM for Moron? Anyway, James Bond movies have always had ups and downs,\nthe last film 'Skyfall' was a mega hit and now this has not stood up to\nthat standard. But very entertaining with all the actions and\nunexpected turns in the narration. As a spy movie, it was okay, but as\na Bond movie is what might upset you, so its upto you how you look at\nit. But to be honest, I enjoyed it.<br><br>7/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI really didn't want to have to write this review on Spectre (2015)\nbecause I am a massive Bond fan and strictly talking about Daniel Craig\nin comparison to his other films, I relished his other efforts in\nCasino Royale (2006) and Skyfall (2008). But here I am. I remain after\nits finishing, unconvinced. And with a certain bitter taste too. <br><br>I am uncertain as to what I just watched because to me it seemed to be\nan weak, overly emotional and no where near hard hitting enough theme\nsong, a sudden and seemingly intense relationship which no one was\nconvinced by (she ain't no Vespa) a somewhat jaded Craig, a highly\nridiculous plot and far too much of the old car chase, helicopter\nchase, explosion and action scenes on overdrive to make it reasonable.\nWhen you strip Bond of some of his basic foundations, cars, gadgets,\none liners and women...I don't know that you are left with Bond\nanymore. Shoving extra action and more story line in doesn't fill that\nvoid. Challenging whether his job and section are still relevant in\ncontemporary society does little but highlight that real life is going\non alongside this overblown attempt. Such a shame, Craig is an awesome\nactor, Sam Mendes is a talented director. How did it all go wrong. Me\nthinks it tried to tie up all the loose ends neatly, but naturally that\nwill bring about criticism- it seems an easy way out! A new James Bond\nfilm should not be a reminder of how great the previous ones were in\ncomparison it should be unique it its own way but familiar enough for\nus all to smile when the burst of trumpets come in.\n"},

{"review": "\nCasino Royale was definitely the Bond film that made Bond interesting\nagain. Great plot, some awesome action scenes, and actors who chew up\nthe scenery, and a back to the basics Bond. Unfortunately, Quantum of\nSolace went south, but I thought that there was room for recovery.\nUnfortunately, did not see Skyfall, but got an idea of what happened.<br><br>That leads us to Spectre. I will cut to the chase: this is reminiscent\nof the loony Roger Moore Bond films, but with more crazy action scenes,\nand a plot akin to Moonraker. While there are some great performances\nfrom the supporting cast like Ralph Fiennes, Naomi Harris, Ben Whishaw,\nand even Andrew Scott, the main cast is half-baked at best. Daniel\nCraig looks tired of playing Bond, while Lea Seydoux is more eye candy,\nand doesn't add any substance to the film. Waltz as Blofeld basically\nis a different version of Hans Landa from \"Inglorious Basterds\".\nPlotwise, it basically is Bond infiltrating Spectre. The relationship\nbetween Bond and Blofeld starts out interestingly enough, but instead\nof fleshing it out, it is left to languish. Coupled with continued\nappearances from the mean looking David Bautista (who is a mix of Odd\nJob and Jaws), this Bond film basically languishes into obscurity.\nBeautiful scenery, and lots of action, but very silly at points. You\ncan check it out if you want to waste some time, but I will leave my\ngood memories with Casino Royale.\n"},
{"review": "\nMaybe I am getting crankier by the minute but I've got to say that I am\ndisappointed with this latest Bond film.

Out of the four films, I'd rank Casino Royale as my favourite\nfollowed by Skyfall, then Quantum of Solace and finally Spectre which I\nfound to be ultimately rather silly.<br><br>The first act of Spectre was admittedly stunning. The first 5 or so\nminutes was a single, continuous tracking shot - absolutely spot on.\nBut the truth is that this is really all that I can vividly remember\nabout this film. A lot happens but the script was so clumsily cobbled\ntogether and so left what could have been a brilliant story line as a\npointless set of great action scenes interspersed with lame and\npainfully slow moments. In short the pace wasn't right which gave me\nthe feeling that this 'series' may have run out of steam.<br><br>Also from a point of aesthetics, Daniel Craig really hasn't aged that\nwell. There was a particularly awkward shot of Bond from behind and you\nknow, he has a pudgy bum. You read correctly. James Bond with a pudgy\nbum.<br><br>Silly film but with great action scenes, Not impressed overall.\n"},

{"review": "\nJames Bond is one of my favourite movie franchises and I adored Skyfall\nit's one of my favourites of the series and I was excited out of my\nmind for this movie and it was my most anticipated movie of 2015 this\nfilm literally had every thing going for it but learned nothing from\nthe major success of Skyfall. Like I said this is not a bad movie for\none the opening sequence before the credits is amazing possibly the\nbest of the series. Daniel Craig continues to shine as bond and\nperfectly portrays the character as Ian Fleming wrote him and gave a\ngreat performance in this movie as did the whole cast. I think few can\nargue that this movie is extremely well made and shot amazingly. When\nChristoph Waltz was cast in this movie I was pumped out of my mind to\nsee him as the villain and looked absolutely terrifying from the\ntrailers and he was a fantastic villain in this movie but he is barely\nin it and that is frankly a stupid choice not to have him in the movie\nthat much. The movie is also far to long and should have been cut by\nabout 40 minutes. The MI6 subplot in Spectre is dull and boring which\nis a shame as they set up all the supporting characters where set up so\nwell in Skyfall so it seemed like they could have a part of the movie\nto themselves. The action set pieces in Spectre are overlong and don't\nthrill enough and drag on Marjory. Spectre has a lot going for it but\ndidn't live up to expectations and didn't build on the events of\nSkyfall and seemed to regress back to the Rogor Moore movies in some\nways. 6.7/10 B-\n"},
{"review": "\nJames Bond. The apple of her majesty's service's eye. Tried to find a\nman because somebody told him to.

{"review": "\nThe worst Bond movie I have ever seen! - and there have been some\ndoozies! Although I am probably slightly biased because I just never\nliked Daniel Craig in this role. I've seen him in other roles and\nthought he was a pretty good actor but he is just not James Bond - in\nany way, shape or form. To make matters worse the plot is mercilessly\ncontrived and clich\u00e9d - even the masterful Ralph Fiennes couldn't pull\nthis one from the doldrums. It did not only lack any classical 'Bond'\nflavour that could at least draw an audience in through nostalgia but\nit also had nothing new to offer - wooden characters and weak\nrelationships - simply too long and stiflingly boring. Aside from a\nheroic attempt from Christoph Waltz who inhabits his character with his\nusual flair and finesse, I cannot find any redeeming quality in this\nmovie.

{"review": "\nBefore you read my review you have to know I have never been a big\nJames Bond fan. But I do occasionally watch them. When it was with Sean\nConnery or Roger Moore I had more fun watching them honestly. Daniel\nCraig doesn't do it to me as OO7. In Spectre he constantly bugs me,\nlike the whole story bugs me as well. What bugs me the most about James\nBond is that he never has a scratch or anything. I occasionally box\nevery now and then and the amount of bruises and black eyes I had are\nnumerous. And I don't fight monster gorillas like James does. Well\nagain in this movie he has a building collapsing on him twice, he's\nbeen in a terrible plane crash, has countless fights and hits against\nwell trained fighters, he has been tortured etc... and guess what? Not\none single scratch, not one drop of blood. Now if he had super powers\nlike any comic hero I could live with that fact but he's not. He's a\nhuman, like you and me, and that annoys me so much. And after a brutal\nfight we of course have to watch him make out with the local bimbo from\nwhom he could be the father, the bimbo that first hated him so much\netc... It's all so clich\u00e9 that it makes me want to barf. The story\nitself isn't good either, it's always the same crap. I really don't get\nwhy people are thrilled about movies like that.

The most serious flaw (a flaw that many movies have\ntbh) is in it's villain. I admit the introduction leading up to him was\ninteresting but then it just...stagnates. He spends so much time\ntalking about what he's done but never actually does anything. Not to\nmention the fail that was Andrew Scott.

Let's not even talk about the uselessness\nthat was Bautista's character. There was no need for the dramatics of\nhis introduction. In fact, there was so much that could have been cut\nout and that time used instead to introduce more by way of character\ndepth to the main villain.<br><br>It's so sad when so many great actors get together to make what could\nhave been a great movie but had a shoddy script to work with.<br><br>The gold in this film lies not with anything Bond does with his Bond\ngirls or M getting down into the trenches or even Andrew Scott's subtle\ninterest in all the men in this movie, but in the Bond/Q relationship.\nShipping aside, their chemistry is absolutely wonderful and I wish\ndesperately that they had focused more on that than with their sad\nexcuse for a romance.
