{"review": "\nTo put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this\nis the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will\nbe beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I\nacknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable\nscene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it\nfor the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has\nto remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context-\nit followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a\nchase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written\nthose films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience\nwith intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie\nincorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious.\nIt also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and\nhighlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films\nnow that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but\nthis is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never\nwill.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nIf you think \"Pulp Fiction\" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that.\nIt's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But\nwhy? Because of the many \"f\" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull\npieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point\n(unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get\nit).\nTarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action,\ngangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the\nmovie is \"cool\", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes\nit by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot\nof irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he\ngave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another\naction heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human\nbeings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series\nand a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or\nselling drugs.\nWhat else is so great about \"Pulp Fiction\"? It's the acting, the directing,\nthe cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest.\nIn my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A\nmasterpiece.\n"},
{"review": "\nPulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite\nappropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time,\nQuentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition\nof pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever\nassembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John\nTravolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken.\nThe dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think\nthat's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many\nOscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of\nthe 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie\n(although Kill Bill came close).

From\nthe story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date\nbetween a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot\nof care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the\norder it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such\nas what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a\nband-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie\nredefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John\nTravolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan\nof film.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nMy oh my.  \"Pulp Fiction\" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is\nboth a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and\nunforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem\noutdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. \nMiramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before\nthis film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they\nknew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making\nbecame the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated\nBest Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and\ndirection by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. \nJohn Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. \nBruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman\n(both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make\nappearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna\nArquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin\nTarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L.\nJackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may\nhave cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved\ndeserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.\n   \n"},
{"review": "\n\nTarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and\nmaybe\nthe best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and\nclaustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even\nthough Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage\nto the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my\nfavourite.<br><br>It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe\nthat it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because\nForrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but\ncome on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much\nmore.<br><br>Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second\nchapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's\nfinest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a\ngreat job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right\nafter having read the script. I like the way his character gives a \"tough\nguy\" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and\ntender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his\nsecond encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene\nwhere\nhe dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest\npoint.<br><br>The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that\nobviously knows how to handle situations. \"And I will strike down upon thee\nwith great vengeance and furious anger...\" is my favourite\nquote.<br><br>Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who\nis at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.\n\n"},
{"review": "\nQuentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets\nbetter with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a\nbig theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and\nmore detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these\nyears? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action,\ngreat and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also,\nthe acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward,\nover the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The\ndirecting is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he\nmakes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never\nin a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has\nbeen copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. <br><br>The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has\nloyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad\nand not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of\nparody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say\nafter seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as\nit had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the\nfirst time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look\nfor the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you\nhead off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you.\n"},
{"review": "\n\n*********Spoiler Warning**********<br><br>When this movie came out a lot of people I knew were making a big deal about\nit because it was made by a guy from Knoxville who even talked about K-town\nin the movie---and guess where I lived at the time?  Most people overlooked\nthat Tarantino was only born there and lived most of his life somewhere\nelse, and both Tarantino and Knoxville are highly overrated.  Trust\nme.<br><br>I can't see why this movie is regarded as highly as it is; it seems the key\nto Tarantino's storytelling is to mix together story elements kind of like a\nblender.  So we get things like the cab driver who's a sexy latin woman\nwho'd look more at home in a luxury restaurant than a grungy cab, or the\nvery seventies looking Samuel L. Jackson running around with the nineties\nlooking John Travolta.  The result is the average person goes \"that's kind\nof strange,\" while the intelligentsia go \"yes, the man is a\nGENIUS!\"<br><br>I put off seeing this movie for several years because of the supposed\nextreme violence and the notorious rape scene.  When I finally broke down\nand watched it I was surprised how tame it was, even the rape scene was\nmostly people shouting behind a closed door.  It was nowhere near as scary\nor unnerving as the one in \"Deliverance.\"  In the end the violence was\nmainly psychological or limited, although the guy getting shot in the car\nand bits of you-know getting everywhere was a real turn-off.<br><br>But really what did the movie in for me was the plot, or lack thereof. \nSupposedly we're getting an homage to film noir and hardboiled fiction\nnovels of the forties, done up in a modern story theme.  What we see on the\nscreen is a confused mess of people running around and doing the most stupid\nthings.  It's not a horrid movie, but there's a lot better ways to spend a\nfew hours.\n\n"},

{"review": "\nSo there is a lot of hype surrounding Pulp Fiction. It won Original\nScreenplay. It was nominated for six other Oscars including Best\nPicture and Best Director.

Pulp Fiction did not really\nmake a whole lot of sense. I can not remember if it was nominated for\nediting or not. If they wanted to be in that category or have a better\nchance at winning then obviously more editing should have happened. I\ndo not see the point of Vince and Mia's date.

Couldn't Bruce and his woman just talk about it? Aside from\nbeing disappointing and boring Pulp Fiction was confusing. Bruce shoots\nJohn Travolta. And kills him.

{"review": "\nPulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is\nthe most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its\nhodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an\nassault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However,\ndespite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance\nput forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an\nOscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner\nthat year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the\nmost commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting,\ngodfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still\nsends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors\nof a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating\naround lately.

The glorification of smut is worse than the smut, and\nthat is exactly what this movie is. The sad thing is, I don't believe\nthat some of these actors were acting at all. They were just being\nthemselves. Travolta and Jackson in wigs??? That was scary! The only\ninteresting thing about the movie was the sequence of events. I like\nthe way that it started at one point and ended in the same, but dislike\neverything in between. The problem with this film is that it tricks the\naudience into giving it great reviews. It uses the \"peer pressure\"\nmethod. You know, \"this movie is for intelligent and cool people\"\nCRAP!! Well, I'll gladly stand among those who know that this was\nnothing more than a \"shock flick\". It was produced to see if the letter\ncould be pushed a little further. Unfortunately, it drags what little\nrespect that Hollywood has with it. I'm afraid that this is one of the\nmajor stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films\nfor vulgar lust.<br><br>There's my two pennies, don't spend them all in one place!\n"},

You know the type: these college kids who just\nlove Pulp Fiction and Fight Club, probably jerk off to Bukowski's\npoetry, think Kubrick is THE GREATEST DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME, absolutely\nLOVE to bash religion and make sure everyone knows they're an atheist,\nand yet still manage to think they're better than you. The sad thing\nabout Pulp Fiction is that I used to enjoy it when I was younger,\nwasn't my favorite movie of all time, but was definitely on the top 10.\nWatching it now, having endured thousands of these guys and their egos,\nleft me bitter and annoyed.

Originality on its own is no virtue. There\nneeds to be purpose, meaning, a particular sense of coherence and\noverall an intelligence to it. All things this movie surely lacks. The\nscript is quite awful and tries hard at being edgy and memorable for\nhow random and 'original' it is. This film is constantly patted on its\nback for being structurally and cinematographically complex and\n'original', but that never makes up for how skin-deep and hollow inside\nit so clearly, evidently is.

Making\nhimself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved\nwith heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked\nby his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia\nWallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster\nhowever not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook\nup but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince's heroin\nfor cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he\ntakes her to Lance's house where he normally buys his drugs and gives\nMia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been\nmessy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a\ngood movie although sometimes hard to follow.

Why was the boxer called Wilson? In \"On the Waterfront\" Marlon\nBrando has a famous monologue in which he expains how his boxing career\nended: He went down intentionally against a boxer named Wilson because of\ngreedy mobsters. Wilson, therefore was the invisble antagonist against\nMarlon Brando. Tarantino, being a smart guy, knew that in the deep annals\nof\nthe film buff world, he could redeem Marlon Brando and all us film buffs\nthat hate Wilson more than anything by killing Wilson. If it wasn't for\nWilson, Marlon Brando \"coulda been a contender.\" So, by killing Wilson\nforty\nyears later, Tarantino effectively killed off the jerk that ruined\nBrando's\nBoxing career in \"On the Waterfront.\" I don't know if many people had\nalready realized this but I thought I would bring up to people's\nattention.<br><br>Also, for Tarantino fans, watch \"Kiss Me Deadly\" (1955) by Robert\nAldrich.\nIt has the answer to why the contents of the briefcase, when opened by\nTravolta, give a glowing lightbeam on Travolta's face and we never see\nwhat's inside.<br><br>\n"},

That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation,\nTarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives\nof the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its\ndark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold.

{"review": "\n\nA great, very enjoyable film from the auspicious Quentin Tarantino. The\nscript is one of the best in a 90's film, and the cast is full of huge\nstars\nwho actually give huge performances. Casting John Travolta as the lead was\nbrilliant, and would seem unusual if you haven't seen Pulp Fiction,\nbecause\nmost of Travolta's other work is, well, I'll say \"not good\". Although Pulp\nFiction deserves much praising, there are things in the film that keep it\nfrom being a masterpiece, ones that I'm sure you can find yourself and\ndon't\nneed my pointing out.<br><br>Watching Pulp Fiction is awesome. I can't wait to get the DVD (the one I\nhave now is terrible- no features!) with director's commentary. It'll be\nfantastic, I'm sure.<br><br>****/5\n"},
{"review": "\n\nPulp Fiction serves as an excellent social critique of the seeming\nglamorous\ndrug and crime world. Jackson and Travolta were excellent. I will always\nthink twice about pawn shops--seeing as how some may have the Gimp tied up\nin the basement. My only question is what was the glowing content(s) in\nthat\nall important briefcase Jules carried around? It is never shown\ndirectly--but appears to give off some form of hypnotic light as noted\nwhen\nit is displayed for the would-be diner robber at the end of the movie.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nQuentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is great! Tarantino wrote it, directed in\nit and starred in it. Top rate cast includes John Travolta, Samuel L.\nJackson, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Quentin himself,\nChristopher Walken and Bruce Willis! Every scene in this film is filled with\nhumorous, thought-provoking and sometimes very dramatic\ndialogue.<br><br>(SPOILER coming up!) Perhaps the most underrated scene is when Christopher\nWalken talks to Bruce Willis (as a child) and explains what his father's\nwatch went through to get to him.<br><br>A great, totally excellent film from a very good director.<br><br>****\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\n\"What country you from Bret? What! Well that ain't no country I've ever\nheard of. They speak English in what?\" <br><br>The character Jules makes this film for the classic it is. If Tarantino had\nthrown in Vince w/ a partner more like himself, then I'd have to say that\nthis would be perhaps the most boring movie I ever saw.<br><br>This is a movie, chartered by three separate but revealing short stories,\nabout the same characters. The first begins with a prologue in a coffee\nshop, then takes you to an apartment where some thugs get capped off by\nJules and Vince. Then the next stories' about Vince taking his bosses' wife\non a date, and then goes on to tell about a boxer who stiffs Marcelus of a\nbribe, and then graduates to explain the prologue. <br><br>Homophobes may not want to watch this one. There is a scene that will make\nyou cringe as I did the first time. <br><br>The dialogue is what makes this film unique, original, and funny as hell. It\nis also the masterpiece which had introduced me to crime/action films, which\nbefore I had been previously uninterested in. <br><br>\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI love this film, one of my all time favorites.  One thing bothers me\nthough.  Jules' mis-quoting the bible.  I haven't seen anything to\nhighlight\nhis embellishment of Ezekiel.  If you care, the verse goes like\nthis:<br><br>\"I shall perform frightful acts of vengeance &amp; inflict furious punishments\non them; &amp; they will know that I am Yahweh, when I exact my vengeance on\nthem.\"<br><br>Nice and simple. Nothing about the paths of righteous man beset by the\ninequities of good men.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nPulp Fiction is the absolute greatest film I have ever seen (and I have\nseen\na lot of films). Quentin Tarantino is just a genius. People think that I am\nstrange for select this film as my all time favorite. In today's high\npriced\nHollywood, when a director can put together the kind of talent that appears\nin a low budget film, and makes it work........he is one of a\nkind.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nQuentin Tarentino masterfully plays with the element of time in this\nOscar-winning black comedy. He weaves four seperate stories that brilliantly\ncome together. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the slightly overweight\nhitman that has to kill boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) who\ndoublecrossed his boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). In another story\nVincent and Julius, another hitman, played by Samuel L. Jackson, go on a\ntrip to recover a case of stolen money from a couple of small time gangsters\nand accidently kill their contact in their car. This is where the Wolfman\n(Harvey Keitel) comes in and saves the day. In between we see how boxer\nButch Coolidge and hitman Vega struggle in everyday life and how Jules is\nenlightened. This all starts with the robbery of the diner where Jules and\nVince discuss religion and saviour and where we meet robbers Tim Roth and\nAmanda Plummer who are taught a lesson by gangster Jules. Definately a movie\nto watch and well worth the Oscar \n"},
{"review": "\n\nIn Quentin Tarentino's masterpiece, Pulp Fiction, the story of two hit men,\na strugling boxer, a feared and reveared crime boss and two diner robbers,\nwe see what a great director can do.<br><br>This is a great film, on parr with Pink Flamingoes and train spotting, and\nvery entertaining. Anyone who enjoys a fun, but at some times twisted good\ntime, should check this out.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nQuentin Tarantino struck mega paydirt with this little diddy of a movie.\nAnd invented, or perhaps, re-invented a whole genre of film.  Tarantino is\nperhaps the most derivative filmmaker in history, but much like rap music,\nTarantino has taken the art of ripping off other people's ideas and making\nthem fresh and cool.<br><br>The shoots out and wiseguys in black suits with skinny ties?  That's\nstraight outta John Woo and Scorsese.  The pop culture references?  That's\nGodard.  The trippy way the film jumps back around in time?  Jim Jarmusch\nand Kurosawa did it first.  Despite all of this Tarantino has made a\nbrilliant film.  You don't just see 'Pulp Fiction'.  You drink it, eat it,\nbleed it, breathe it, savour it, spit it out and ask for more.  You can dig\nthat can'tcha?\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nA spectacular and surprising (original) three movies in one! Won the Golden\nPalm for best Movie (Cannes 1994) and was nominated for seven Oscars; got\nonly one... for original script. Brilliant plot, surprising scenes,\nterrific\ndialogs and great humor! My favorite scene is the one that Vincent Vega\n(Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are discussing French\nfries being served in The Netherlands; with loads of mayonnaise! (a true\nfact).\n"},
{"review": "\n\nPulp Fiction fascinates in many ways. Under it\u00b4s delusive external surface\nyou can find great irony. Tarantino shows us every possible kinds of\nrepulsive characters and ugly situations. Satire certainly isn\u00b4t an easy\ngenre: neither for creators nor for audience. Everything you see in this\nmarvellous film is opposite of the purpose. Where Tarantino aims to, is to\nmake fun of the vanity of violent action films. The movie treats current\nproblems in film-making: superficiality and distorted values. We are\nentitled to get a good laugh in Pulp Fiction many times, but why? Enjoying\nthe endless cruelties? No. Because of the discriminating critic against\nimmorality? Yes.         \n"},
{"review": "\n\nQuentin Tarantino movies  always seem obsessed with three  things, 1) a\nnonlineal structure, 2 hip language and  3) pop culture references.  While\nPF isn't really complex or deeply philosophical it is tremendously\nentertaining. The three stories involve two out law lovers ( Tim Roth and\nAmanda Plummer), a boxer ( Bruce Willis) and two philosophizing hitmen (\nJohn Travolta and Samuel L Jackson). The film is an endless recycle of\n50's\ncrime dramas, film noir, french new wave, action movies, b exploitation\nfare\netc. , but it is the unique spin that Tarantino puts on these old\nconventions and cliches which makes it so clever and inventive. Also\nTarantino's great use of music which sets the moods of his films\nperfectly.\nThe film has some memorably funny dialogue and quirky characters that\nleave\nan indelible mark on the viewer equaling two and half hours of\nentertainment\nwell spent.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie really gorges with characters view angle and the normal \"from\npoint A to point B\" is replaced with fickle sense of time; picture jumps\nround but in the same time gathers the plot in to one piece. Pulp is\ncult.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nIf you have read any of my other comments, I usually olny comment on the\nmovies I hate.  That is because they trigger emotional responses from me, in\nmost cases, dissapointment and hate.  But here, I am writing this review\nbecause I felt awe after seeing this movie.  I absolutely love this film. \nThe dialogue is hilarious and it provides great insight into the lives of\nthose involved in organized crime.  Fiction or not, it still is pretty\nrealistic.\n   There are several great things about this movie.  1)  Characters.  The\ncharacters portrayed by.....everyone in this movie are great.  These\ncharacters have depth, humor, and are colorful.\n    2)  Story.  This is not a movie for people who only half pay attention. \nA lot of laughs are caused during this movie because you think, \"So that's\nwhy that happened.\"  People complain that this movie has no plot.  If you\ncan't find a plot, look harder.  It is basically about the lives of 4 people\nover a course of 2-3 days.  Even though it is so simple, the situations\nthese people go through in these days are comical and interesting.\n   3)  Direction.  Tarantino is just plain great.  The camera angles and\nsets are colorful and cool.  The moods are dark and, well, moody and the\nmusic is incredibly well matched to the scenes and locations.  Good job,\namigo.\n   This may not be a movie for everyone.  But if you like movies like \"The\nUsual Suspects\" and \"Four Rooms,\"  don't pass this one\nup.\n   Final Thought:  Great, one of my top 10.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWhile I still think Reservoir Dogs is better, this film is definitely\nfunnier, and more engrossing. Divided up into three stories, my favorite\nbeing the first one, it is always spitting little surprises up for it's very\nshort 150 minutes. While the last story does lose a bit of the films\nsustained momentum, it gains it back quickly, giving way to an excellent\nconclusion. Not to mention on of those undeniably intriguing opening\nsequences.

The ingenious script written by the\nbest of the best, Quentin Tarantino, keeps you on the edge of your seat\nthroughout.
