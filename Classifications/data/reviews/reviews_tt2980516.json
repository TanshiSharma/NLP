{"review": "\nWhat a wonderful accomplishment of a film by James Marsh (Man on Wire)\nwho brings such depth and beauty to the life/love story of Stephen and\nJane Hawking. The film is adapted from her novel on their life and\nbrings forth much of the love and tenacity necessary to care for and\nlove someone going through great physical struggles over time. Eddie\nRedmayne and Felicity Jones give fantastic and intimate portrayals of\nStephen and Jane during their courtship and lives together. My vote for\nbest film at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. In Q&amp;A\nafter film James Marsh told a great story about Stephen Hawking's\nreaction to the film where he gave the response that it was in \"largely\ngenuine\"... and Eddie Redmayne said that Stephen Hawking after viewing\nthe film allowed them to use his actual \"voice\" instead of their\napproximation for the film that they had produced. The most touching\nwas that Hawking had tears to be wiped away after viewing which will\ngive to you a sense of how genuine this film is.\n"},
{"review": "\nWe are all familiar with the story and with Steven Hawking. His\ngroundbreaking work 'A brief History of Time' and devastating\ndisabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness\nand immortal fame.<br><br>But few of us could understand the complexities of his personal life\nand the shocking divorce in 1990 from his long sacrificing wife of more\nthan 25 years. Indeed that episode served to darken his reputation in\nthe minds of many, including myself, who felt ill at ease with anyone\nwho could leave a partner who had done so much for him just at the long\nawaited moment when international fame and recognition finally arrived.<br><br>This wonderful production, so well scripted and paced throughout,\nserves to explain that vital anomaly in Hawking's life. And it is made\nall the more poignant as it is based upon the account written by his\nwife who has borne so much.<br><br>But it is the breathtaking performance of Eddie Redmayne as Hawking\nthat simply blasted this film into an extraordinary level. It is\ndifficult enough to mimic so famous a person as Hawking and it is even\nmore difficult to portray so accurately the debilitating and gradually\nincreasing effects of Motor Neuron Disease. But to transmit so clearly\nthe profound emotions and inner suffering that Hawking must have\nexperienced in his agonizing journey was a performance that left me\nquite speechless and at times in uncontrollable tears.<br><br>It would be a travesty of the industry if Eddie Redmayne is not\nnominated for an Oscar after this performance. And to my mind it was a\nwork of art that simply cannot be equaled let alone beaten.<br><br>Have a good handkerchief ready to hand.\n"},
{"review": "\nBut it does tell an inspiring story about Stephen Hawking's personal\nstruggle with his illness that's very uplifting.<br><br>The story of Stephen Hawking and his then wife Jane, apparently based\non a book she wrote about it, which probability explains why there was\nnot much science in the movie, not that I'm complaining, as it was a\nwell played film about a difficult relationship.<br><br>I didn't known Stephen and his wife actually met around the same time\nas he began to suffer from Lou Gehrig's Disease. Makes the whole\nconcept that Hawking has three kids with this woman more interesting\n(something was working). Felicity Jones did a great job playing such a\nstrong, patient, and compassionate woman, all well narrated in this\nmovie. The difficulty Jane Hawking had being with a man getting trapped\nin his own body, played by Eddie Redmayne.I have herd of Hawking's\nsurprisingly positive personality, not because of his condition, but\nbecause I expected his condition would make it hard to express any\nemotion. Redmayne did his research to express the struggle of Hawking\non camera nicely (I keep forgetting The Hawking is a Brit).<br><br>This movie turned out to be a great one about the time span of a\nrelationship. Done more romantically than borderline soft-core flicks\nlike Blue is the warmest color and 9 songs, and it was not as\ndepressing as Blue Valentine. it was just a true take on a complex\nrelationship taking it's toll, well performed by some brilliant actors.<br><br>If your looking to watch this movie to hear some science talk, that's\nnot what the movie is really about, unless ironically convincing the\nworld of his theories on time was really as easy as the movie makes it\nout for Hawking. Overall very enjoyable.\n"},
{"review": "\nA biopic of Stephen Hawking, mostly focused on his relationship with\nhis first wife, Jane (the film is based on her own autobiography). It\nhas little interest in what Stephen Hawking is about, except for very\ncursorily. I guess that's not a huge problem, but, frankly, I don't\nknow that much about Hawking and wished I had gotten to learn more from\nthis movie. It does deal a lot with his disease and health struggles,\nwhich I suppose many are more interested in. The film will surely be\nmost notable for its two lead performances. Eddie Redmayne certainly\nnails the physical side of Hawking and projects a very clear character.\nFelicity Jones, though, does better work as the woman who has to work\nvery hard to make their lives work. No one else really registers much\n(though David Thewlis and Emma Watson, among many others, are\nfeatured), but that doesn't really matter. The filmmaking is competent\nbut not notable. James Marsh, best known for his documentaries Man on\nWire and Project Nim, has done good work in feature filmmaking before\nwith the underrated The King. Here he doesn't get much to register. My\nfavorite thing besides the lead performances was the very pleasant\nscore, by Johan Johansson. Probably worth seeing on video, but don't go\nout of your way.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie completely misses the mark. The world is interested in\nStephen Hawking for his scientific contributions to the world. The fact\nhe has a horrible illness is incidental. This movie drags the viewer\nthrough the weeds of Hawking's pain and suffering and never let's up\nuntil the final minutes of the movie. It was exhausting to watch and\nleaves the viewer with no real answers to the questions they came to\nbetter understand, explore and enjoy. <br><br>For example, questions like these never get addressed what exactly are\nHawking's contributions? How have they shaped thinking and helped\ndevelop a better understanding of the universe? Why was Hawking's PhD\nthought to be so magnificent and why did Hawking later seek to disprove\nhis original theory? Did he disprove the original theory? How has\nHawking been able to live so long despite a two year prognosis given in\n1963? What lead Hawking to consider the existence of god?<br><br>Hawking is played by Eddie Redmayne who does a fabulous job making you\nfeel as though you are watching Hawking himself.<br><br>This movie is about a man with a horrible illness who happens to be a\nmagnificent scientist. The story should have been told the other way\naround.\n"},
{"review": "\nI've read scientists are turned off by this film for its omissions,\nsimplifications, falsities, and other failures to explain Prof.\nHawking's theories. I can understand that, being a law specialist who\ncan't watch law dramas. But if you're not a cosmologist or a physicist\nyou should not be discouraged by the film's failure to give you enough\ndetail for a two credit course. It's a good drama of people, a bit\nschmaltzy as befits the facts, and in that regard I understand it's\npretty accurate, and is definitely well acted and directed. Also a nice\nglimpse of what Oxbridge life was like in the 1950s. As they say, the\nmale lead is Oscar bait.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis type of movie must be factually correct above everything else.\nInstead it is a hodgepodge of 50% theatrics, 49% personal life drama\nand 1% science and even that of questionable accuracy. <br><br>For example, it seems to imply that the theory of singularity was\ndeveloped by Hawking and it was immediately hailed by the scientific\nworld which is totally at odds with the account given by Hawking\nhimself in his own book. <br><br>The theory of stellar collapse was developed by Subrahmanyam\nChandrasekhar on board a ship on his way to England for higher studies\nat Cambridge. It was based on his flash of insight that while Pauli\nExclusion Principle is limited by Relativity, Gravity is not and\ntherefore when a star above a certain mass (later named Chandrasekhar\nLimit) begins to collapse, it completely disappears into a mathematical\nabstraction called singularity. This shockingly alien concept was hotly\ncontested by the scientific orthodoxy and ferociously attacked by his\nsupervisor Sir Arthur Eddington and opposed by Einstein himself even\nthough the mathematics was irrefutable (\"A Brief History of Time\", P.\n83-85). <br><br>In fact, Eddington's hostility was so vicious that Chandrasekhar had to\nswitch his field of study although it later formed the foundation of\nthe theory of Black Holes which was built upon by others like\nOppenheimer. Arthur I. Miller's \"Empire of the Stars\" gives a detailed\naccount of Chandrasekhar's scientific career and his rivalry with\nEddington.<br><br>Hawking is unquestionably one of the most brilliant minds of our time\nbut to credit him with the achievement of another brilliant mind and to\ntotally distort history does grave injustice to both of them and\nmisguides the viewers.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was hugely disappointed by this film after all the hype.<br><br>First niggle was seeing Jane Hawking played by a model actress. That\nmade her attraction to the awkward and frankly not very charming young\nversion of Stephen Hawking difficult to believe.<br><br>A major problem throughout was over use of soft focus, it made the\nwhole thing feel very unreal.<br><br>It hardly touched on Stephen's work at all. All it seemed to say was he\ngot praise for one idea and then got praise for another idea that\ncontradicted his first. Hardly portraying the work of a genius, which\nStephen undoubtedly is.<br><br>So OK it's supposed to be a love story then. What love story? I felt no\nreal chemistry between the two leads at all.<br><br>Then there is the chocolate box representation of middle England and\nthe stereotypical characters in it, again all in soft blinking focus.<br><br>As for Eddie Redmayne's performance it was OK but I did not find it at\nall engaging. It was a good physical impression of Stephen Hawking but\nwhere was the passion, where was the angst? Sadly missing for me.<br><br>One final niggle, there is a scene towards the end where Stephen is\nsupposed to be conversing with Jane and it is absolutely clear that\nthere is no way he could be creating the text on his computer in the\nspeed required to produce the conversation we see.<br><br>I watched it with my wife on Valentine's day eve and she was equally\nunimpressed. <br><br>How this film can be considered for any Oscars is a total mystery to\nme. Whiplash is so so so so much better.\n"},
{"review": "\nOur subject, Stephen Hawking, was on the verge of discovering THE\nTHEORY OF EVERYTHING, but the director obviously didn't realize before\na montage sequence shows two people getting married, and then their\nbabies growing into toddlers before our very eyes, we should know the\ncharacters just a bit.<br><br>The romantic setup at Cambridge University, bathed in an opulent\nnostalgic glow of academia, does look wonderful. And yet the meeting of\nStephen and his first wife Jean is so quick and easy, it's not one bit\ninteresting.<br><br>As an actor and probably the next Oscar winner, Eddie Redmayne\ntransforms from a quirky, ambitious student into the tortured,\nwheelchair-bound genius, but the performance shouldn't be compared to\nDaniel Day Lewis in MY LEFT FOOT since this particular vehicle seems\nmore like an actor's workshop than a fleshed-out biopic with a genuine\ncharacter arc.<br><br>It's as if the scriptwriter wanted Hawking's controversial philosophies\non Atheism, through the prism of discovering a powerful Black Hole, to\nhave a cinematic soundboard \u0096 with an intellectual date movie buried\nwithin the stardust. Yet after tedious bouts of soap opera diatribes we\nnever really know the man behind the suffering and brilliance, and how\nhe managed to bridge his personal life with his breakthrough in\nscience, and beyond.<br><br>Like an actual Black Hole, this particular THEORY has an intriguing\ndesign with absolutely nothing inside.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt was sad to see a film take such a wonderful subject as the life and\nambitions of Mr. Hawkins and attempt,dismally, to create it for nothing\nmore than a contender in the awards 'game'. This is the kind of tripe\nwhich is accepted all too readily as biopic material and offers little\nor nothing of the person or their skills other than to show off as a\nproffered mating ritual. Mr. Redmaynes painstaking efforts are the only\nreason I gave it any rating at all. With all the facts and wonder we\nhave have at our disposal about the man, why is it that there is little\nor nothing involving his deep, driving demand for 'the answer' and all\nthat is entailed in his studies. Rather we are given still another\nsexist portrayal of two people battling impossible odds to finally give\nin to their bases needs, with others. Not only old fare but out of\nplace and cheapening to the real story line. I could only try to\ndissuade others from subjecting themselves to this demeaning film.\n"},
{"review": "\nDay Two of Cinemark's Oscar Movie Week brought us the illustrious life\nstory of quantum theorist Stephen Hawking. His degeneration is\nunraveled with precision, but there's really not much else to make this\na memorable film.<br><br>Hawking is portrayed by Eddie Redmayne, an actor who's deserved his\nchance to shine for a long time now. His performance is nothing short\nof beauty, especially considering the movie was filmed out of sequence.\nHis ability to show the many stages of Hawking's illness is remarkably\nimpressive. Felicity Jones' performance as Hawking's wife Jane is\nequally impressive as we watch her struggle to maintain her husband's\ncondition.<br><br>Unfortunately, the rest of the film is not so adept. The film plays out\nlike the very mathematical equations in which its subject envelopes\nhimself. It almost feels like a TV movie in its formulaic sympathy.\nThat's not to say it isn't a tragic story, but its telling did little\nfor me.<br><br>For the first two-thirds or so, the film doesn't seem to know what it\nwants to be: A touching story of a seemingly doomed affair, or a bold\nstatement on Hawking's theories. Ultimately it succeeds at neither,\namounting to a light, safe, almost entirely forgettable romantic drama.\nEven the score, which has been winning countless awards this season, I\nfound indistinguishable from any number of films of the same ilk.<br><br>I really hate the term \"Oscar Bait,\" but if a movie were to define it,\nthis would be the one. Its only salvation is the performances of its\nleads, who seem to be the only ones giving the film any heart.\n"},
{"review": "\nI found this movie to be very thin.This is a quite boring and\ntraditionally made biopic of Steven Hawking.I was hoping it would be\nshowing us more of an insight into the brilliant mind of Steven.It does\nnot.It's subject is more or less: how to cope &amp; go on living with a\nvery disabled person as a spouse.I'v understood that the base of the\nfilm was the book by Jane hawking Stevens wife.Although one might say\nthat the main character gives us good acting....it brings us\nnothing.IMO.it's just a sentimental 13 in a dozen biopic and never\noriginal. a missed opportunity!It would be far more interesting if we\ngot more offered why Steven Hawking is such an immensely important\nscientist.\n"},
{"review": "\nHere are my reasons, in summary: <br><br>1) The film goes way too fast, we jump from one scene to another and\nthe events develop very quickly, not giving us time to assimilate what\nhappened. Examples: Stephen's and Jane's Romance, Stephen's theories\nabout time, children that appear out of nowhere and finally Stephen and\nJane's separation. <br><br>2)You're never sure what this film is really about. Is it about love?\nAbout the universe? About life in general? It's probably about all that\ntogether, but there is no balance with these topics for sure. <br><br>3)The last scene, where Hawking answers questions from the audience,\nseems way too forced. I believe the filmmakers wanted this too become a\nmemorable scene, but it doesn't really feel that way. There is no sense\nof a climax here, since SH only gets asked comfortable questions, so\nthere is no conflict. He is already world famous and very successful, I\nget that, but that just makes the audience not care too much about him,\nsince he has nothing to lose. <br><br>4) It's never explained how SH managed to live more than the expected\ntwo years. I'm sure there is an explanation for that, but it is never\ngiven in the film. <br><br>5) Finally, I have the feeling this movie never really takes off. It\njust seems to be at the same emotional level during the two hours,\nwhich makes it rather flat. This is very connected with #1, I felt like\nthe entire film was a giant trailer for a bigger film. Dunno how to\nexplain it better. <br><br>Those are my general impressions of the movie, maybe you agree with me,\nmaybe not. I agree that Redmayne's acting was great, but I wouldn't\ngive this movie more than 5 points out of then. Definitely not compare\nit to \"A Beautiful Mind\"\n"},

I rated it with a five only for them\nand the soundtrack (i love The Cinematic Orchestra, which Arrival of\nthe Birds and Transformation was PERFECT for that final scene that\nbrought lots of tears to my eyes)...but that's about it.<br><br>The movie focuses way too much on the romantic life of Hawking, his\nwife, his children (who suddenly disappear when it's convenient). I\nwanted to see more of Hawking's academic life, how his brilliance was\nacknowledge (you get only two fast paced scenes on this). I wanted to\nsee how his theories changed the way we view ourselves, the universe,\nand our place in the universe. I wanted to see how he contributed so\nmuch to science in general and cosmology. Of course i wasn't expecting\na documentary or i would see one, but i was expecting a film about\nHawking and not about how ELA destroys a person's ability to move and\nto be 100% dependent on others. I definitely wasn't expecting to see a\nmovie developing at the speed of light, where you can't really measure\nhis brilliance (i mean, that shot of Hawking's on a cover of a magazine\nto give us a glimpse of how famous he was becoming is atrocious).

Safe to say I was\nhooked from beginning to end - not even seconds of slight distraction.\nI don't find physics uninteresting, but I don't know enough about it to\nbe a great judge of that part - but given that this movie focuses on\nthe relationship between Jane and Stephen it shouldn't be a problem\n(it's pretty much a movie for everyone). I don't get how some people (a\nminority, of course) can low-rate this. Even if you're disappointed\nthat it's not mainly about Hawking's scientific work, this doesn't make\nit a bad movie. And the fact that it's based on Jane's book SHOULD be\nwarning enough. <br><br>I've watched Hawking's series 'Into the Universe' a while ago. It's\nmostly animations with a voice-over, but you do get to see him in the\nopening (and as far as I remember also the closing) sequence. I've also\ncome by him in interviews and articles and stuff a few times. Each time\nhe strikes me as a lovely man. You just know that he's funny and\nsympathetic, and that's quite amazing to me due to the fact that he has\nno facial mimics or body language to make use of. That in particular I\nthink is captured really well in this movie. Eddie Redmayne does an\namazing(!!!) job and the Oscar was fully deserved.<br><br>Another thing worth mentioning is how authentic it seems - of course\nbecause it's based on the biography by his former wife, Jane Wilde\nHawking - but it's not at all slushy at any time. Jonathan (played by\nCharlie Cox) would probably have been the antagonist had this been a\ntypical Hollywood production, but that's not how you feel. The\nantagonist is solely the disease and its after-effects. To witness the\nmisery it brings through this movie was simply heartbreaking and I was\nsobbing half the movie more or less. <br><br>I will undoubtedly recommend this movie. It is a must-watch.\n"},

{"review": "\nThe theory of everything is probably one of the best movies I've seen\nso far this year. Everything about and around it has its own right\nspace. The story is more about Jane (Felicity Jones) rather than\nprofessor Hawking - in fact it's an adaptation of the book \"Traveling\nto Infinity: my life with Stephen\" by Jane Hawking. It's her fight for\nher love for Stephen first, and then against his disease. She is the\nstrongest character, even though the public easily sympathizes with\neveryone. They are people who have encountered difficulties in their\nlives and they feel extremely pure. The script is well written: the\nfact that it is focused more on the personal life of Stephen Hawking\nmakes it easier to follow, although dealing a little more with his\nprofessional research would have made it deeper and maybe more\nphilosophical. The cast simply does a great job and Eddie Redmayne's\nperformance is superb and outstanding - hopefully it will bring him a\nBest Leading Actor Oscar.\n"},

That said the film often feels\nwarm and intimate, that you have been invited in, like a talk through\ntwo decades of a family's photo albums given by them in their sitting\nroom.<br><br>Jane and Stephen come across as absolute heroes and it is their example\nand the feeling of being invited into a life which made the film\nworthwhile for me.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's not a film full with science, massive actions and stunning visual\neffects, it's just a simple story narrating the life of a noble\nscientist. Not knowing of how true is the screenwriters adapting\nStephen Hawking's life to the big screen, but the moderate pacing does\nnot upset the audiences as it fills with a lot of interesting theoretic\ndialogues which some might be funny and the special yet specific\ncinematography has successfully crafted a beautiful life full of love.\nA big applause for Eddie Redmayne who has worked hard to portray a\ncharacter with motor neuron disease that looks extremely real, nature\nyet pitiful; while Felicity Jones is doing great to support by building\nup a charming and emotional chemistry. With amazing and calm scores\nfrom J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson to enhance the overall tone of the film, the\nbiopic inspires us that when there is life, there will be hope and so,\nto be courageous, to be strong in overcoming challenges, it will still\nbe successful in achieving dreams. It also ends impressively and\naudiences would have stunt for a moment thinking on what we have made\nso far in our life.\n"},
{"review": "\nI went into this film with quite a good knowledge of Hawking's life and\nworks from the book 'a brief history of time' and various\ndocumentaries. So I didn't think I'd learn anything new. But I was\nsurprised when I found out about the effect the disease had on Jane and\nthe rest of their family.This was due to the superb acting from Eddie\nRedmayne and Felicity Jones.<br><br>Jane (Jones) is a determined woman who wouldn't stop at anything to see\nStephen through the difficult times he endures; without Jane Stephen\nmay not be with us today (today being his 73rd birthday) and so we may\nhave been missing out on the expansion of knowledge in the Physics\nworld that he still offers.<br><br>I was also surprised that Jane had another love interest during her\nrelationship with Stephen. This was sad to see from all of the support\nshe had given him but I guess she thought it was time.<br><br>The only negative things about this inspiring film is the pacing and\nlack of science. I know it's the story of Stephen and Jane but surely\nthey could of added more. Anyway I did enjoy this uplifting story so I\ngive it a 7.8/10 recommended especially if your a fan of love stories\nand the brilliant professor!\n"},

{"review": "\nLet me state the good things about \"The Theory Of Everything\". First,\nEddie Redmayne does an excellent job of conveying the progressive\ndegeneration of Stephen Hawking's condition. Felicity Jones is good, if\na touch too saintly, as Jane Hawking. Secondly, the storyline of the\nfilm is formulaic but competent. This makes \"The Theory Of Everything\"\npleasant, occasionally funny and occasionally emotionally involving.<br><br>It is neither Redmayne's nor Jones' fault that that their parts bear\nonly a passing similarity to the people they are depicting. However, it\nis wholly the writers' fault that the story departs grossly from Jane\nHawking's book, upon which the film is said to be based, in several\nplaces. Characters are invented, scenes that never took place are\ninterpolated into the story and some real events are shifted in time\nfor purely dramatic effect in a way for which not even Stephen Hawking\ncould provide a proof! In short, \"The Theory Of Everything\" has to be\ntaken as mostly a fictional representation of the lives of the\nHawkings.<br><br>If you go to see this film simply to be entertained and don't mind\nwhether or not what you see is accurate, then you will be entertained.\nHowever, if like me you dislike wondering whether or not one scene is\nreasonably true to the facts but the next one is an invention - or vice\nversa, or that both are true, or that both are fictional - you may be\nirritated.<br><br>I find it troubling that so many films purporting to depict the lives\nof real people or historical events distort the truth with a total\ndisregard for the consequences of spreading what, in effect, are lies.\n\"The Theory Of Everything\" falls squarely into this unedifying\ncategory.\n"},

Still, the\nmovie glows with passion and sympathy for its characters, and it has a\nphenomenal performance by Eddie Redmayne (\"Les Mis\u00e9rables\"). The\nscreenplay is based on Jane's book \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life\nwith Stephen.\" <br><br>\"The Theory of Everything\" is a great parallel between Stephen\nHawking's declining health, his success as an author, lecturer, and\nscientist,and his marriage to Jane Wilde. <br><br>Eddie Redmayne, who has recently won an Oscar for his brilliance in\n\"The Theory of Everything\", from the beginning exhibits the early on\ncomings of ALS long before he is diagnosed formally. His ability to\nmimic and imitate these on comings enable Redmayne to display his\nincredible ability to portray such a brilliant mind such as Hawking. <br><br>\"The Theory of Everything\" has such a great parallelism, heart, and\nemotion as both Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones portray the brilliant\nmind of Stephen Hawking and his wife and caretaker, Jane Wilde.\n"},

{"review": "\nThe Theory of Everything is about the life of Stephen Hawking who is\narguably the greatest mind alive today. He came up with a black hole at\nthe center of the universe. This movie is the story of his life. From\nwhen he was in school to when he came up with his theory to when he\ngets Lou Gehrig's disease.It's also a pretty easy movie to follow when\nit comes to the science. The most impressive thing in this movie is\nEddie Redmayne's performance. Every phase of the disease was like a new\nperformance by Eddie Redmayne. He had to adapt to the circumstances and\nact a certain way for where he was at in the phases of the disease.\nWhether it be in appearance, movement, speech etc. The man gave it his\nall and definitely deserves his Oscar nomination. But Let's give credit\nwhere credit is due everyone's performances in this movie are out of\ncontrol This really in not a movie about his theories. It is more of\nhim as a person and his relationships, schooling, his disease. This is\na movie about his life and journey. Really my only gripe is it is a\nvery by the numbers biographical movie of a person. In all honestly\nthat doesn't really matter. In the end Theory of Everything is\ninteresting, engaging, your interested in the romance, your interested\nabout whats going on in his life. I definitely recommend you to go see\nthis.\n"},
{"review": "\nA biopic of Stephen Hawking, in my opinion, was always bound to be of\ngood quality due to his amazing achievements in the evolution of\nscience. This film, from it's inception, just pulled me in. The way in\nwhich the characters were professionally played, its touching on 1963\nCambridge, and its overall style was a real pleasure to witness. What\nfirmly sat my bottom to the seat though was how the film makers made\nthe film believable in almost all aspects of the movie; its characters,\ntheme, language, education, success and portrayal of Stephen's\nfailures, It felt as if each stage of the film was its own mini-series\ngradually developing into one complete element of great film making.\nWell Done!\n"},

{"review": "\nI really enjoyed the wonderful acting in this film. Both leads and a\ncouple of the supporting cast are top notch. What occurred to me after\nseeing it and reveling in the characterization is that while it's a\nnice love story, it could have been about almost any talented person\nwho hooks up with an amazing, loyal woman. What I am saying is it is\nmore a story of triumph than a story about Stephen Hawking and what he\ntruly is. We see his day to day existence and his conquest of strife,\nbut we know little of the professional man other than the rewards he\nreceives and the controversy he engenders. Of course, he is the\nrepresentation of modern physics and cosmology, but that is left for us\nto read for ourselves. There are documentaries exploring his life as a\nphysicist and some are superior to this. Nevertheless, the love story\nwhere one gives all one has for another is hard to dismiss. I found out\nthat Eddie Redmayne spent time with the great genius in order to\ncapture his essence. He spoke of Hawking's great sense of humor and\nwhat an incredible labor it is to be him. This will probably be\nnominated for some Oscars, but beyond the acting categories I don't see\nmuch else.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt took me a little while before I wanted to see this movie - a movie\nabout the genius Stephen Hawking suffering from ALS, but boy am I glad\nI did. We all know how this movie ends, after all, Hawking is still\nalive today. His journey, however, holds many surprising twists and\nturns which give one an even greater appreciation for this great man\nand his incredulous story. Eddie Redmayne (Hawking) will surely get an\nOscar nomination, and if he wins, it would be well-deserved. He was\nmagnificent; you never felt as though he was acting which made his\nperformance utterly heartbreaking. Felicity Jones, as his wife, Jane\nWilde, was also superb. If the actual Jane was anything like the one\nJones portrayed, then Ms. Wilde deserves the title \"Saint.\" This film\ncertainly gives a wikipedia type summary of Hawking's life, and there\nare some moments of slowness in the film (hence an 8 out of 10), but\nthe message of this film is 10+. What resonates the most is the theme\nof the movie, which for me, is that living a life filled with hope and\npositivity takes courage, sometimes to heroic heights. Perhaps\nHawking's genius goes even beyond his aptitude in science, but rather\nlies in his attitude toward life. The manner in which he's lived and\ncontinues to live sums up the Theory of absolutely Everything.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is based on the book written by Hawking's first wife Jane\nWilde. It covers the period from 1963 to 1997. If you are interested to\nhear about Stephen Hawking's theories in great detail you better watch\nThe 2013 BBC documentary/movie \"Hawking\" currently on Netflix. This\nmovie does take into account Hawking's theories but the focus is on his\npersonal and family life. <br><br>And it does a very good job at portraying his first marriage and the\nlove and devotion of his devout wife through the course of Hawking ALS\ndisease. Some have slighted this movie for not covering Hawking's\ntheories in too much detail, but there is already a good BBC film on\nthe scientific discoveries of Hawking, so a rehash of the same\nterritory would have been a waste of time and effort.<br><br>The movie focuses on Hawking's first marriage. It covers how he and\nJane Wilde fell in love and married despite Hawking ALS diagnosis and a\nprognosis of death within 2 years. It is presented with humor and grace\nand tenderness. It traces Hawking's gradual deterioration from walking\nwith difficulty with canes, to crawling up the stairs, to getting\nwheelchair bound, to losing his voice and yet surviving and not\nsuccumbing to the disease in 2 years as was the prognosis. The movie\nshows the toll the disease took on Hawking's wife that led finally to\nthe separation and finally divorce.<br><br>The acting in this movie is very good, played with understatement and\nsincerity. The humor is endearing. It is not the definitive film on\nHawking, but restores a balance that was missing in the BBC\ndocumentary/movie. So in that respect it is a different take on\nHawking's life and work.\n"},

I'm not quite sure why, but something\nabout the mix between horrendous tragedy and incredible inspiration\nwhich go hand in hand in this movie, and in Stephen Hawking's life, is\njust incredibly moving. It captures the essence of being human; the\nconstant tension between calamity and euphoria which touches all our\nlives in one way or another.

I realize that I need to cut to the chase, here: I'm torn because\n\"Everything\" is obviously a labor of love, and a paean to a\ncontemporary secular saint.

{"review": "\nFor many of us, Stephen Hawking is that old guy in the wheelchair, and\nhas always been that old guy in a wheelchair, but it turns out he was\nonce a young guy on a bicycle who fell in love and got married. And\nhe's British, which one never realizes from his computer voice. <br><br>Theory of Everything shows Hawking's brutal physical deterioration in\nthe context of his marriage. Eddie Redmayne is impressive in expressing\nthat deterioration while still showing the man trapped in an\nincreasingly uncooperative body. Eventually he has little to work with\nas an actor besides his eyes and lips, but he does a lot with those.<br><br>It's the sort of performance that always wins Oscars (Hollywood loves a\ngood disability acting job) but honestly I was more impressed by\nFelicity Jones, who expressed a steely, quiet determination and, as the\nmovie progressed, increasing frustration. Often she isn't given much\nmore to work with than Redmayne, being asked to tell the story with her\neyes, and she does so marvelously. Even though the movie is ostensibly\nabout Hawking, it feels like it's at least as much her story as his\n(not surprising, since much of it is based on her book).<br><br>While the story is often touching and absorbing, the writers ultimately\ncouldn't figure out how to end it. The movie has two scenes that feel\nlike endings, one at a Q&amp;A and the actual ending, but both feel like\nthey're struggling to create a profound moment out of fairly ordinary\nmoments. For me the lackluster ending lessens the overall impact of the\nmovie; a good ending would have made this an 8 instead of a 7. <br><br>After watching the movie I read an interesting article on Slate on how\naccurate this was.

His role was much\nmore physical, and he pulls it off perfectly. The Oscar he won was\ndefinitely very well-earned. <br><br>Overall The Theory of Everything was great. It's realistic and well-\npaced, and there isn't a whole lot that I can say against it (other\nthan inaccuracies in information, which don't really bother me at all).\nIn the end I'd certainly recommend this movie to pretty much anyone.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was always surprised to that as people with big problems with the\nhealth do something. \u0426hen I have watched the film about Stephen William\nHawking, I have understood why they do it. Life all this. Love all\nthis. The person surpasses all expectations. There are people who after\neach failure cease to do something and go towards the aim. But such\npeople as Stephen Hawking on the contrary keep optimism also aspire to\nthe purpose, overcome all difficulties of their life. I am ready to be\nproud of such people. When I look at them to me there is a wish to\nlive. I think that Eddie has played a leading role in the film\nperfectly, he has given to the audience all emotions, all feelings,\neverything that occurred on the screen. It deserves separate\nadmiration. I am the person who doesn't understand physics and\nastronomy, but when viewing I could understand many things so it is\nvery good when actors speak available language. Stephen's relation to\nthe family and to the friends is shown very brightly. We can understand\nas strongly he loves them and for the sake of what he lives .\n"},

{"review": "\nThe Theory of Everything, is an interesting film with some truly\nbrilliant acting especially on the part of Eddie Redmane who deserved\nhis Oscar for an amazing transformation, at times you think it is the\nreal Stephn Hawking. As it was with Jamie Foxx' portrayal of Ray\nCharles this is acting at it's very best. <br><br>Felicity Jones was also brilliant as Jane Hawking and all the\nsupporting cast were all very believable.<br><br>The film itself concentrates on the relationship between Hawking and\nhis wife and touches on the arrival of the Nurse Elaine Maso who in\nreal life he eventually married, although the controversy surrounding\nher is not covered in this film. A lot of the film touches on the\nrelationship between Jane and organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones although\nthere is some ambiguity over what actually happens. The conflict\nbetween Jane's religious views and Stephens views are also touched on.\nIt is a shame more was not made of Mr Hawkins brilliance as a Scientist\nbut then that might be hard to put over in a movie where human\nrelationships are easier to portray. Over all though this is a good\nfilm and worth a watch if only to witness the amazing acting of Mr\nRedmane.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Theory of Everything is a partial biopic of a physicist-cosmologist\nStephen Hawking. It dwells upon the part of his life when he meets his\nwife Jane and gets to suffer from a severe disease. The story begins\nwith his life in Cambrige, when he met his future wife on a party.\nAfter he was diagnosed Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which further led\nto paralysis, the doctors made a frustrating prognosis that he would\nhave only 2 years to live. But nevertheless Stephen and Jane never gave\nup hope and kept fighting the disease. Stephen develops a theory about\nthe visibility of black holes and becomes a world-renowned physicist.\nWatching this film, I was impressed by Jane's love for Stephen. In my\nopinion many girls would have left the disabled boyfriend. As a wife\nJane was a very responsible housekeeper. Moreover, she consequently had\nthree children with Stephen. That shows great devotion. She loved him\ndespite his disability. The movie earned several awards and nominations\nincluding the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film received four\nGolden Globe Award nominations. It was well received by critics and\nviewers who noted excellent acting of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity\nJones. In conclusion, I'd like to say that this movie shows that while\nyou live you have hope. I liked this movie very much and I would\nrecommend all my friends to watch it.\n"},
{"review": "\nIn 2014 a new film \"The theory of everything\" came out. It was directed\nby James Marsh and if only I didn't watch this film, maybe I haven't\never hear about him. The main roles were played by Eddie Redmayne as\nStephen Hawking and Felicity Jones as his wife Jane. This film is based\non the Jane's novel \"Traveling to Infinity:My life with Stephen\". You\nknow, Jane refused for three years to screen her book. In this film we\ncan see first Jane's and Stephen's meeting and evolution of their love.\nIn my opinion this film is full of feelings. Some people like to\ncompare this film and another with Benedict Cumberbutch, but I think it\nis silly, because \"Hawking\" (2004) is about science. I think, the main\npoint in this film is Stephen's discovery about black holes, little\ntime is allotted for Jane. And another situation in this film is that\nJane is the main character, after Stephen of course. James Marsh's\nmovie allows us to look at family life. Eddie Redmayen is a good actor.\nHis reincarnation into the famous physicist is worthy to see: his\nmimics, his actions. You must see this. The camera-work was sometimes\nfantastic, but another moment are not so good. In some scenes you can\nfeel the whole tragedy or importance of actions. Some moment were funny\nand some - sad. Also there are some minuses in this film. For example:\nthe camera-work or actors works, in some moments. In conclusion I want\nto say, that I like this film and I will watch it again. <br><br>P. S. Costumes are great! Time rules are complied.\n"},

{"review": "\nWhen you make a biopic of someone who is still alive, it is extra\nchallenging to keep the balance what is true, and what is glorified.\nAnd when you make a movie that cover a number of years, you're going to\nhave to make some shortcuts.<br><br>The scenes in this movie that were done for exposition or explaining\ndifficult concepts worked quite well, and while you know it's one of\nthose aforementioned shortcuts, they do not break the flow of the movie\nat all, or take you out of the realism.<br><br>The story is a great one, and one that needed to be told. Because of\nhis illness and his genius, it is difficult to understand Stephen\nHawking as \"just another guy\" - but this movie shows us how he\nstruggles with the same emotions as the rest of us. And he shows a\ndifficult relationship in a way that respects both parties.<br><br>That said, I do wish they could have explained Hawking's importance in\nthe world of physics a bit more, as the movie shows that he is\ntalented, but does not really delve into his talent.<br><br>The main attraction in this movie is the acting.

{"review": "\nTHE THEORY OF EVERYTHING has everything you'd expect from the typical\nHollywood biopic, and as such is rather predictable. Not only that, but\nits subject is still alive (and very famous) which robs it of a lot of\ndramatic tension. Still, Eddie Redmayne gives an extraordinary,\ntransformative performance as Stephen Hawking, as does Felicity Jones\nas his long-suffering first wife Jane. The story starts with Hawking's\nyears at Cambridge and up through the publication of \"A Brief History\nof Time.\" Instead of focusing on the accomplishments, the film is\nreally about the relationship between him and his first wife, as the\nbook is based on her memoir. The romance kind of comes out of nowhere,\nbut after spending two hours with them you really begin to feel for\nthem, especially Jane, who ended up having to put in overtime as her\nhusband's caregiver (until help was brought in). The scenes which show\nthe gradual progress of Hawking's condition (Motor Neuron Disease/ALS)\nwere quite moving as well, but only in the most general sense. It also\n\"helped\" that the score hinted at just the right moments when you were\nsupposed to be emotionally affected. So, while the film is sure to stir\nup emotion and possibly provoke tears at certain points, nothing the\nfilm does with those moments is that special in and of itself. What\nreally makes this film worth seeing is for Eddie Redmayne's\nperformance, which deservedly won him the Best Actor Oscar this year.\nOf course, the rest of the cast, which includes Emily Watson, Charlie\nCox and David Thewlis, does outstanding work as well. Overall, it's not\nparticularly groundbreaking in terms of the biopic and romance formula,\nor in its execution, but Eddie Redmayne takes it to another level with\nhis portrayal of one of the world's greatest living minds.\n"},
{"review": "\nI think Director James Marsh is successful in creating a drama out of\npure internalization. Not a scene is this film that emotions are so\nvisible. We do not see, but feel so much. This is why a film without so\nmuch plot can get away to become an art piece. What is best in this\nfilm is the sense of restraint, owing, I believe, to Mr. Marsh. He must\nhave directed Eddy Redmayne and the rest of the cast to feel first and\nact later. Probably an act is not necessary, if you feel so accurately.\nI am always marveled by the English school of acting. Big or small\nscreens. They do wonders with the mundane of lives in particular. While\nAmericans look for something extraordinary, English instead eye for the\nnormality, which always turns out to be not so normal. Professor\nHawking, as well as his beloved Jane, come alive in this film. They are\nactually alive, and this film will ensure that they are, even after\nthey no longer are. A scene of their breakup is amazing. Loving,\npainful, understanding, and heartbreaking. How can four feelings be\nincorporated into one scene, I still wonder? That's life, isn't it?\nBittersweet at best, and always conflictual at extremes. If there is a\ncaution for Eddy Redmayne, it is by way of being tied to the same or\nsimilar character. Felicity Jones, on the other hand, will continue to\nbe versatile and multi-purposed. The Oscar-winning brand can also be a\ncurse, one of which I wish all the best for our dear Mr. Redmayne.\n"},

Felicity Jones is fine as his\ngirlfriend who stands by him when his illness is diagnosed and becomes\nMrs Jane Hawking. <br><br>The story here starts in 1963 when Hawking is a new graduate student in\nPhysics and is having difficulty declaring a field of study for his\nPhD. But he finally gets inspired and writes a thesis on the origin of\nspace and time as a singularity that became the Big Bang. Of course\nlater in life he said his new theory goes against that earlier one.<br><br>The thing about this type of Physics, there is no good experimental\nevidence for most of them, making it difficult to know how valuable\ntheir contributions might be, aside from his best-selling book \"A Brief\nHistory of Time.\" <br><br>As the movie unfolds we don't get a good feel for the time but in the\nend there are Hawking children in their late teens so it must have been\nup to about 1990 or so.

The film really is first class and\ntells a story of Hawking's life (I say \"a story\" not \"the story\")\nextremely well. As a piece of story-telling it is an example to hold up\nto other film-makers. It is of course a crowd-pleaser and a\ntear-jerker, but what is wrong with that - it is what we expected after\nall.

A few close-up shots suffered from poor\nfocus and others from clumsy focus-pulling but in an average cinema I\ndoubt anyone would notice.
