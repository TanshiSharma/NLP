{"review": "\n\nBrilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old.  \"The Silence of the\nLambs\" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent\nto interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the\ngreatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer\n(Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they\ndie.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to\nthrow a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor\nof Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless\nto say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller\nthat has no equal.  At the heart of \"The Silence of the Lambs\" are the\nconfrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess\nmatch of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured\nfor the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately\n17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself around\nyou and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you\nhave seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5. \n\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for\nlittle more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't\nbored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing.\nSuch is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to\nforget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal\"The Cannibal\" Lecter, is a brutal\nkiller with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very\nintelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as\nyou like).A clich\u00e8 by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key\nelements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice\nStarling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is\na dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young,\nunexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent,\npsychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure\neveryone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had\nto be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be\nthe chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a\nnon-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a\nfilm's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for\nmore.<br><br>Best watched with a nice Chianti...<br><br>P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?\n"},

That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew\nthis movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an\nintense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this\nfilm would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.<br><br>Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch,\nespecially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer,\n\"Buffalo Bill.\" \"Bill\" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and\nprofane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant.\nThis movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes\ninvolving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is\nsome extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other\ninmates are held.<br><br>Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent \"Clarice Starling\" and Scott\nGlenn is low-key and effective as \"Jack Crawford.\" A major part of the\nfilm is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts\n\"Clarice,\" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a\ncase. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.<br><br>Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie.\nHis portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is\none viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the\nsequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with\nintelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.<br><br>\"Silence Of The Lambs\" has turned into a modern-day \"classic.\" If by\nsome odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark,\ndifficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off\nother things.\n"},

Taut\ndirection and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film's\npower, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performances\nof Hopkins and Foster.  Their interplay -- and remember, they only share a\nhandful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting. \n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWith Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror\ngenre.  It is a first-rate production all around.  It boasts a witty and\nsuspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. \nIt has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well\nthroughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of\nClarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two\nlead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is\nvery good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up\nthe screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins\ndoes the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and\nyet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He\nsays his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The\nrest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a\nunethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the\nother killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in all\naspects!\n"},
{"review": "\nThere is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of\nthe Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter.\nTaking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially\nmemorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly\nmakes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence\nof pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in\nthe interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a\ncredit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in\nstereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with\nroles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The\nRemains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any\nnumber of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling\nperformance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want\nto feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture\nof brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins,\nHannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend.\nHe is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided\none of the most quotable lines in recent film history with \"I ate his\nliver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\", which was followed by\nan inimitable slithering slurp.)\n"},
{"review": "\nSilence of the Lambs is a quintessence of a profound character study\nand a rare and vivid demonstration of an actor's subtle brilliance and\nhis improvisation in manifestation of a nebulous entity (Lecter),\nalmost single-handedly immortalizing it and in the process elevating\nhimself to a position of unqualified envy and ubiquitous acclaim. In\nfact, one is likely to suffer, either from inarticulacy or verbosity\nwhile describing Anthony Hopkins portrayal of sadistically\nsophisticated Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's trademark, his wide open\nglacial eyes, devoid of any emotion, not only makes him deviously\nequanimous, but also egregiously peculiar. The fast, slurping-type\nsound invented by Hopkins that Lecter does, is as fascinating as it is\nchilling and Lecter's infamous \"Good evening, Clarice\", is as\nenthralling as it is vicious. Anthony Hopkins's performance is the\nshortest ever and the most memorable to win an Oscar in the leading\ncategory. <br><br>Hopkins as Lecter, is incontrovertibly and incredibly at the top of his\ngame and it is his brilliance that gets the best out of the other\nactors, especially Jodie Foster. In fact, it won't be a hyperbole, that\nAnthony Hopkins's portrayal of cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter in Silence\nof the Lambs and more so in its sequel, Hannibal (which is my favorite\nof the series, as the story completely revolves around Lecter, giving\nhim more exposure), is one of the best, the world of cinema has ever\nseen or offered. In spite of having some of the most gruesomely\ndisturbing and viciously graphic sequences, Silence of the Lambs, is\none of the most decorated and enthralling movies of all time.

Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins's performances are absolutely\noutstanding, Foster is a very likable and believable police officer,\nand Anthony Hopkins completely becomes his character, Hannibal Lecter\ndidn't seem like an easy role to do, but he did it so naturally, with\nno hesitation. This film won five Academy Awards and is only the third\nfilm to win the Big Five, which it completely deserved, it isn't a\nmovie that you would expect to win Best Picture, but I am very happy it\ndid. Dramatic, terrifying at times and without a doubt, film gold, I\nwould recommend Silence of the Lambs to anyone looking for a good\nthriller or drama. <br><br>A young FBI agent must meet with a psychopathic serial killer in order\nto catch one who is still on the loose. <br><br>Best Performance: Anthony Hopkins\n"},
{"review": "\nArguably the best movie of all time. I understand that the Silence of\nthe Lambs gets a little discredited for being gory and at times\nhorrifying. I have never felt a rush more powerful and exhilarating\nthan when I watched this movie. I've seen it enough where I can now\nquote it line by line, but the very first time I saw the movie in its\nentirety, I was stunned. I was blown away. I continue to get that\nfeeling even now when I watch for the 25th time or so. As a whole, it\nis such a though provoking movie. Think of the plot of Se7en, the\nDeparted, Pulp Fiction, Inception - they all make you think and really\nunderstand the movie. To me, Silence of the Lambs does that better than\nany other film in history. Not to mention how great Jodie Foster as FBI\ntrainee Clarisse Starling and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal\nLector/Hannibal the Cannibal. When you watch this movie, don't take it\nfor its goryness and horror. You have to take it for its deep meaning.\nThe moth, the biggest symbol of the movie, as Dr. Lector says\n\"represents change\". As Clarisse hunts down on serial killer Buffalo\nBill (Ted Levine - excellent job as well), Dr. Lector is enlisted to\nhelp her while his genius lies alone in prison. One for the ages. No\ndoubt about it. MUST WATCH&gt;\n"},

{"review": "\nA tight-wound thriller, and sequel to Thomas Harris' 1981 novel Red\nDragon (though the movie Red Dragon came almost a decade later on this\nmovie's shoulders), this is quite simply one of the best novel to movie\nadaptations till date. It can be easily compared with great adaptations\nlike To Kill a Mocking Bird, One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest, Lord of the\nRings Trilogy among others. <br><br>Coming to the characters, 'Hannibal' played so dexterously and\nchillingly by Anthony Hopkins still gives me the creeps, with good all\nround performances by others. Jodie Foster as an FBI trainee plays her\nrole to perfection in finding a serial killer with Hannibal's help.\n'Buffalo Bill' played by Ted Levine has also done great job in his\nportrayal as a psychopath killer whom the FBI is searching for.<br><br>The plot is simple yet the viewer simply can not escape the tension\nthroughout the movie. There are enough twists and turns to keep the\nviewer glued to the movie. You wait for Hannibal to come on screen in\nthe same way you wait for dinosaurs to come in the Jurassic Park. The\ndirection is impeccable and editing is spot on. The suspense is\nbrilliantly maintained and the sound track adds to the atmosphere.<br><br>No wonders this movie won all the major academy awards for the year\nincluding best actor to Anthony Hopkins.<br><br>If you have not watched this movie and even if you are not a fan of\nhorror or suspense movies, you are certainly missing one of the best\ncreations in the history of cinema.

{"review": "\nBecause of The Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed\nidentification for the horror category. It is a first-rate production\nall around. It boasts a witty and dramatic script based on the Thomas\nHarris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from\nDemme. Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great\ndirectorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell\nand the FBI men breaking into a home. The two lead actors won Oscars\nfor their performances...each deserved. Foster is very good in her\nrole, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen\nwith his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer. Hopkins does the\nseemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet\nforbidden some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation. He\nsays his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.\nThe rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout\nas a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.

Hopkins picks away at Foster's inner demons, forcing her to open\nup her troubling past. In exchange, he reveals more and more\ninformation on the identity of a notorious serial killer.

He plays is straight, so to speak, never letting the plot\nbecome secondary.

Nothing that happens in this movie couldn't happen in real\nlife (and it does happen). This approach also harnesses the lead\nperformers. He never lets Foster get too melodramatic, and never lets\nHopkins become a flat Halloween mask. As frightening as the film is,\nthere is a moral core throughout that neither hides completely nor\nbrow-beats you.

{"review": "\nOver 20 years after I first saw this film I have now decided to put\n'pen to paper' so to speak and praise what I think is one of the most\ngripping murder movies made, with a host of actors from Jodie Foster,\nScott Glenn,Anthony Heald, Ted Levine - who was a relative newcomer\nthen - and of course Anthony Hopkins firmly at the top of their game.\nEveryone knows the story by now of how Clarice Starling(Foster) has not\nyet passed-out of the FBIs famous academy at Quantico when and where\nshe is under the close supervision of one of its chiefs Jack\nCrawford(Glenn)and they are on the hunt for a serial-killer 'Buffalo\nBill'. They or perhaps SHE seeks the assistance of Dr.Hannibal Lekter,\na brilliant but disturbed criminal killer himself and she has intimate\ntalks with him in his cell to garner information she hopes will help\nfind 'Bill' before he kills more innocent young women in his most\nderanged and brutal way mutilating them. The only criticism I saw\nthroughout the film was the plausibility of the situation Foster finds\nherself in towards the very end and whether that would be possible? I\ndon't know - I 'm NOT in the FBI and having read the 'Trivia' I think\nthis has been explained. Other than that, a brilliant film that just\nkeeps delivering and when I saw it recently on Spanish TV for about the\n5th time it was just as good as when I first saw it and there are very\nfew films that you can say THAT about!\n"},

Love the \"feel\" of this movie - dark,\ndingy and cold. Anthony Hopkins is amazing. Very chilling, but you\ncan't help but like him. Watching this as an adult still gives me the\ncreeps.

Even\nthe character of Buffalo Bill is very much creepy but Lekter wins for\nme. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal has delivered a stunning performance.\nJodie Foster has also done a good job. The psycho-thriller theme is\nwell established throughout the movie. Its creepy in a sense. The movie\nis nearly perfect in every aspect. Even the background score settles\nwell enhancing the environment.

{"review": "\nIt's hard to believe this film is twenty years old, having seen it when\nit first came out and not again till now. The movie lived up to it's\nopening hype as a masterful thriller bordering on horror. Anthony\nHopkins' portrayal of serial killer Hannibal Lecter defines the story,\nbut when all is said and done, his character doesn't appear in the\npicture very much at all. However when he does, one's attention is\nriveted to the screen, attempting to outguess director Jonathan Demme's\nnext move in a deadly cat and mouse game between Lecter and his\nadversary, be it FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), or hapless\nsecurity guards caught unaware by a scheming mad man.<br><br>The larger plot involves the chase after a serial killer known as\nBuffalo Bill, named after a penchant for skinning his female victims\nafter he murders them. To say that the picture has it's grisly moments\nwould be an understatement. There are more than one scene that require\ncaution for the faint hearted, visualizing grim aspects of brutality\nthat don't leave much to the imagination. Buffalo Bill himself (Ted\nLevine) is an inspired piece of work, a monster that could have stood\nalone as a title character if not part of this larger story.<br><br>Without giving it away entirely, I have to say that the hunt for\nBuffalo Bill gives rise to a clever gimmick that will catch you off\nguard for a moment, only to redirect itself very quickly to it's\nsuspenseful conclusion. This one's recommended for fans of\npsychological thrillers who'll try to guess the ending only to be set\nup for one more neat twist at the finale. Anyone for a glass of\nChianti?\n"},

{"review": "\nSilence of the Lambs is a horror/thriller film most notable for its\ncharacter of Hannibal Lector a cannibalistic psychopath played by\nAnthony Hopkins. Jodie Foster is one of my favorite actresses and she\nseems a little too vulnerable here to be an FBI agent. Anthony Hopkins,\nsurely one of the world's greatest actors, is suitably creepy as\npsychopathic Dr. Lector, however, I prefer his performance in Magic;\nhis role is much larger in that movie and he does more acting. Jonathan\nDemme, also one of my favorite directors, does a good job but, once\nagain, I prefer his Married to the Mob (1988) or Harold and Melvin\n(1980) over this film. Howard Shore's musical score is terrific. As far\nas violence goes, Silence of the Lambs might have been shocking when it\nwas release but, by today's standards, it is tame. There are no\nlingering closeups of violence. The CSI TV series shows much more\ngraphic images. I see why this film won Academy Awards, mainly because\nthe competition was not that stiff. Although it's a good film, it does\nnot deserve the high status that is has been accorded. But it is still\nwell worth seeing because of the tension it manages to build and for\nthe terrific performances of Hopkins and Foster.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had never seen Silence of the Lambs and decided to pick up the book\nby Thomas Harris recently. I was thrilled by the book and I read the\nentire thing in about a week.

The\ncinematography is awesome, Foster and Hopkins turn in A+++ performances\nand the story contains the book's intricacies while moving at a pace\nfast enough to satisfy. The only detail left out of the movie that was\nin the book was that of Crawford's wife's death and ongoing sickness. I\nthink this really made Crawford seem rather one dimensional in Silence\nof the Lambs and takes a lot away from his character in the book. My\ngirlfriend had only seen the movie and she described him as a bit of a\nsleaze which shocked me because he is such a genuine and honestly good\nman in the book that is simply in the middle of a massive internal\nconflict. However, this does not really detract from the movie at all,\nI simply felt that Crawford was an underdone character but understand\nthe need to simplify him.

As Dr. Lector questions Clarice of the lambs, her mental\nanguish is forced and she must relive memories of the murder of her\nfather, the town marshal, which could help fuel her search of Buffalo\nBill. As Lector educates Clarice on coveting, his face transforms into\na slightly evil glare that shows the brilliance and evil coinciding in\nDr. Lector's mind.

Jodie Foster is good in anything\nthat she chooses to take on and the casting was perfect for Buffalo\nBill. Ted Levine really fit that freaky hick part so well.<br><br>I thought the pacing of the movie was great to along with the\ncinematography which added to the suspense a great deal. Awesome\ndirection and execution throughout the whole movie. I would consider\nthis movie to be a must see for everyone interested in the thriller or\npsychological genres.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Silence of the lambs\" is one of the masterpieces of the last decade.\nAnd does it have its reasons. First of all, it's entirely dependant on\nthe terror that gnaws all the way to the mind of the viewer. The\ndecline of the Human Being is magnificently chiseled with one liners\nthat amusingly depict the killers and psychopaths state of mind and\napproach us carefully into a nature that is deformed, evil and sick of\nthe Man's putrefaction.<br><br>The main spectacle is drawn between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins.\nBoth entirely relevant to the movie, they produce a bright contrast and\nwith their performances they nail the feelings right and expose one of\nthe best duels on movie history. This duel, although, is not\nconventional. Clarice Starling (Foster) will use Hannibal Lecter's\n(Hopkins) profound knowledge of the criminal mind to capture the\ninfamous Buffalo Bill. But Hopkins will play a game in which their\npersonalities will engage in a retroactive combination, in a \"quid pro\nquo\" mind spar: she will have to expose her most profound, hidden\nsecrets to Lecter, so he can also dispatch on his pleasure of analyzing\nthe suffering of others. Both of them reveal all of their character's\nwhole personality with their eyes: Foster is in constant pressure,\nscared but facing the natural Hades with courage and Hopkins shows\nhuman emptiness in his eyes, windows to what is a world full of\ndepravations.<br><br>Ted Levine is truly scary. You get the impression that he is the true\nBuffalo Bill, twisted and perverse. He shows absolutely no human,\nrecognizable aspect. He is a terrible villain.<br><br>The movie will straightly envelop you in an obscure labyrinth where the\nhuman mind is retorted and rotten, with a depressing score and settings\nthat are grey, murky and never joyful. One has to see it to get a close\napproach on the dark side of the mind it or at least, to make their\nspirit shake and tremble.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt seems as though there is a serial killer out there who's grabbed the\ndaughter of a United States Senator and this guy has zoomed right to\nthe top of FBI's Most wanted. This man's modus operandi is to keep the\nvictims alive for a while before killing them so they're racing against\ntime to find him. Desperate situations call for desperate measures.<br><br>The desperate measure is, you want to catch a serial killer, bring in\none as a consultant. That's why FBI trainee Jodie Foster goes to visit\nAnthony Hopkins in prison. Hopkins is not just a killer who eats his\nvictims, he's a brilliant psychologist himself with insights maybe no\none else has.<br><br>Of course his price are some cheap insights into Jodie Foster's soul,\nthrills he probably got when he was in practice.<br><br>The Silence of the Lambs in less capable hands could have just been\nanother cheap slasher flick. Instead the leads who walked off with the\nAcademy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress give riveting\nperformances of a sick twisted psycho and a woman who became the\nbiggest feminist icon since Sigourney Weaver by confronting some demons\nof her own. It's the best work that Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster\nhave ever done and let's not forget the Oscars won by Director Jonathan\nDemme and the Picture itself for being the Best in 1991.<br><br>A couple of players who made their marks on television later on also\nscore well here. Anthony Heald who was Buffy the Vampire Slayer's\nhandler plays the psychiatrist in the institute where Hopkins is\nincarcerated and who Hopkins makes a fool of and says at the end he's\nfar from done with. Also Ted Levine who is Captain Stottlemeyer on Monk\nplays the serial killer the FBI is trying to catch. Also look for a\ngood performance by Brooke Smith as Levine's potential victim.<br><br>The Silence of the Lambs with its taut direction and riveting\nperformances has an appeal far beyond the horror genre. See it and\nyou'll know what I mean.\n"},
{"review": "\nSPOILERS<br><br>The Silence of the Lambs is the best movie ever created. It is based on\nthe book Silence of the Lambs and is about a FBI trainee seeking help\nfrom a cannibal to try to catch a man who skins his victims. This is a\nhorror film that won the top 5 Oscars. The acting of Anthony Hopkins,\nJodie Foster, and Ted Levine is superb. Howard Shore's music is great,\nand the cage scene and killing of the 2 officers is one of the best\ndeaths I've ever seen on film. Starling does get Buffalo Bill in a\nterrifying night-vision scene. Overall , this is my favorite film of\nall time and is a must-see for horror fans.<br><br>10/10!\n"},
{"review": "\nI think there is not much to say, all who like thrillers know this one.\nThis is just so brilliant movie, Brilliant Thriller, more of the mind\nthan action. With spot on cast for this kind of movie, especially the\nchemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster is great. And Jodie\nFoster was perfect choise in her role,as she is known to be very\nclever/genius and gifted, and was known this in her childhood.<br><br>Very good example how good movie can be made around few things, if\npeople doing it are the right one. Last line is of course for great\nDirector who made this all possible.<br><br>I hope there would be more like this, but todays lines in Hollywood is\nnot giving much a chance for that , its a shame.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat can I say about \"The Silence of the Lambs?\" Besides the fact that\nit's one of the greatest mystery films, great actors, and a great\nstoryline . . . . go and see it if you haven't.<br><br>Clarise Starling and Hannibal Lector make a great pair in the movie.\nAlthough some parts aren't for kids (as in Buffalo Bill and some\nblood), it's a good movie to see if you're home by yourself if you want\nto watch a mystery combined with adventure. Not many police films are\ngood to see, but this one wouldn't make you waste $10 or something like\nthat. Recommended to anyone who likes police/mystery films, Jodie\nFoster, and Anthony Hopkins.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe young FBI agent Clarice went to visit the in-jail horrible killer\nHannibal in order to solve the series-killer-case. Clarice was afraid\nof him. She also had the psychological problem that haunted her from\nthe childhood. Although Hannibal treated her with consideration, what\nhe had done was so cruel that nobody could imagine. The strange\nchemistry reaction happened between them since their first meeting.<br><br>Hannibal's action embodied the complexity of humanity. He was gentle to\nClarice. However he was so brutal to the other people. You cannot\nbelieve that was done by the same person. Sometimes we do know little\nabout ourselves.<br><br>It was rare to see that a movie won the best actor and actress (the\nacademy award) at the same time. It just proved that it was Anthony\nHopkins and Jodie Foster made the movie so outstanding. No one can deny\ntheir wonderful performance. The following Hannibal and Red dragon had\nlost the original idea and could not achieve the astonishing effect\nthat TSOTL brought us.<br><br>A thriller classic. 9/10\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you want a movie to watch in the dark, look no further than The\nSilence of the Lambs. Jonathan Demme's tense thriller combines\nexcellent actors and a wonderfully adapted screenplay to make, what\nseems to be one of the best, if not the best, thrillers of all time.<br><br>The film follows three main stories, those being that of rookie FBI\nagent, Clarice Starling, the psychopath murderer Buffalo Bill and\nimprisoned psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, imprisoned for murder and\ncannibalism. Clarice is sent to Dr. Lecter to attempt to gain\ninformation on Buffalo Bill, because he was a former patient of\nHannibal, however all Hannibal is interested in is getting inside\nClarice's head. As the film goes on Clarice becomes more deeply\ninvolved in the case, right up to the dramatic and excellent climax, as\nwell as Hannibal becoming more deeply involved in Clarice's mind.\nMeanwhile Buffalo Bill continues his murderous spree, killing and\nskinning women.<br><br>This movie is like no other. It combines tenses scenes with a cast like\nno other. Anthony Hopkins was born to be Hannibal, and why Michelle\nPfeiffer was originally suggested for the role of Clarice over Jodie\nFoster is bizarre, but because Jodie Foster got the role, it doesn't\nreally matter. When it comes to violence this film is very intense.\nThere are some graphically violent scenes, however the worst violence\nin the film is the mental violence. Hannibal's ability to destroy\nsomeone mentally, is incredibly disturbing, and the films motives are\npretty full on. However this contributes to the films overall feel of\nhorror, which is why The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most\nmentally frightening films of all time.<br><br>Stars: 10/10\n"},
{"review": "\nReasons this is so good:<br><br>It has some of the best characters ever created embedded in a storyline\nthat is so famously crisp, and clever that to watch it even after 100\nprevious viewings is still an absolute delight. <br><br>It is a film of sheer talent, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins play\neach others nemesis yet hide this in a tight net of trust and curiosity\nover each others character. and I think the unbelievable potency of\nHannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter is so strong that to actually merge him\ninto reality is totally feasible. <br><br>Jonathan Demme also pulls off such fantastic direction, that is\nshockingly vivid and imaginative, and the atmosphere created with eerie\nscores in the background and repulsive locations (such as Buffalo\nBill's house) is brilliance to a high degree. If you only ever watch\none film a year I suggest you watch this.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Silence of The Lambs explores the life and mind of Clarice\nStarling, a female FBI agent who has a lot of issues to deal with.\nSomehow by fate, she ends up meeting Hannibal Lector, and they strike\nup a very unusual relationship. The most interesting parts in the movie\ndeal with the 2 of them just talking.<br><br>The highlight of the movie is obviously Anthony Hopkins' performance.\nHe's delightfully creepy as Hannibal. The whole suspense of the\ncharacter is thinking he's about to do something violent, since\nthroughout the movie you only hear stories about the terrible things\nhe's done. When he finally does do something, it really pays off\nbecause it's one of the scariest and most memorable parts in the movie.<br><br>The Silence Of The Lambs appeals to many people. That's because it can\nbe viewed from so many angles, and that's why it's become a part of our\npop-culture. I'm not going to write any longer, because I'm having an\nold friend for dinner.<br><br>My rating: 10/10\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis film scared the crap out of me the first time I saw it, and\nconsidering\nhow many horror/suspense films I had seen by that point, that's no small\nmatter. At the same time I was giving my nervous system a workout, I was\nsitting there in awe of how well written the film was, how excellently\ndefined and sketched all the characters were, how intellectually\nchallenging\nthe piece was, and how unbelievably good Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins\nperformances were- thank God they both won Oscars. Frankly, I was\ndisappointed to learn that there would be a sequel, as I think this film,\nand its story, stand so well on their own and need no elaboration. As\nexcellent and terrifying as JAWS, only with people... which is somehow\neven\nscarier, once you really start to think about. I worry the sequels will\nrun\nthe way of JAWS 2, 3D, and THE REVENGE.  \n"},

Also Foster\n(who's Southern accent comes and goes at an alarming rate) is just OK.\nI'm really surprised that she won the Oscar for this. PLOT SPOILER\nAHEAD!!!!

{"review": "\nA serial killer, dubbed Buffalo Bill, has been murdering and skinning\nyoung women and the FBI are getting nowhere. Jack Crawford, the agent\nleading the investigation, decides to try something different; he sends\ntrainee agent Clarice Starling to talk to incarcerated serial killer\nHannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector hoping that he might provide some\ninsight; it won't be easy though; Lector likes to play mind games with\npeople and he is soon trying to get young Clarice to reveal some\npersonal secrets. Soon another body is discovered then Buffalo Bill\nkidnaps another victim; this time the daughter of a US Senator; with\nthe clock ticking before he kills her the FBI offer Lector a deal;\nunfortunately the doctor in charge of the facility housing Lector tells\nhim the deal isn't real\u0085 he then arranges another deal and Lector is\ntransferred to Tennessee. Here Clarice sees him one last time and,\nafter revealing details of a childhood trauma, is put on the trail of\nBill and into a potentially deadly situation.<br><br>This is an impressive thriller that is still effective after a quarter\nof a century and numerous spoofs of some of its most famous scenes.\nWhile the story is ostensibly about the hunt for Buffalo Bill it is as\nmuch about the growing relationship between Clarice and Lector as he\ngets her to open up about herself; something she has been warned about\ndoing but does to gain his trust. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are\nboth impressive in these roles. The rest of the cast, most notably\nScott Glenn as Crawford and Anthony Heald as Dr Chilton are pretty good\ntoo. While there aren't a lot of violent scenes those that there are\nare particularly brutal. As the story approaches its conclusion the\ntension rises until the conclusion that remains very tense even after\nseveral viewings of the film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to\nthose wanting a solid thriller; just be warned it isn't for the\nfaint-hearted.\n"}
