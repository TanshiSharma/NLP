{"review": "\nI can't really believe that I just finished watching a Ridley Scott\nscience fiction movie and feeling this low, this one never felt like\nanywhere close to any of his classics. This is just nothing but a\ntypical Hollywood s***. Matt did a poor performance as a character who\nis caught in a life and death situation. He is not scared or emotional\nbut instead he keeps throwing Hollywood typical punch dialogues on your\nface like an Avenger hero when you are expecting Science. A make-up\nartist or a sound engineer from the set of \"Big bang theory\" would have\nwritten better science script and dialogues. For me there are plenty of\n\"WTF\" or \"Seriously?\" moments in this movie and I wonder what happened\nto one of the favorite directors of all time. Also repetitive high\nfive/triumph scenes where we don't feel anything. To brief: Drag, bad\ndrama, insensitive emotional scenes, poor acting, very less science,\npredictable and not at all funny punch dialogues! Just YIFY it, don't\nbuy!\n"},
{"review": "\nSpoilers below. <br><br>The worst thing about about this movie was that everything is so hard\nto believe because it's such nonsense. It doesn't follow basic physic\nlaws. It doesn't take much to get me invested in a movie as a viewer,\nbut this just goes too far. The absolute worst flaw is not even all the\nfake science, nor I'd it the overuse of disco music or the fact that\nthe astronaut doesn't really get desperate and only makes cheesy\njokes... No, it's the fact that China's space program has some secret\nspaceship which they want to reveal and give up for the eyes of the\nworld to save one unknown American dude. That just doesn't make any\nsense. First of all, China could care less, also, why give up a rocket\non which you've been apparently working in secret, just to send food up\nto space? And if all this would happen for some strange reason...\nAmerica responds with 'ok. I see. Thank you'. Hangs up and goes '\nyessssssss.' Idiotic.\n"},

Too many stereotypes. Blatant\nsales and marketing, actor and story picks for the sake of selling more\ntickets.<br><br>I hope I will save my money and time, next movie like this comes out.\n"},
{"review": "\nI read some of the reviews and decided to review this title myself.\nThat's because I'd like you not to miss this lovely movie.<br><br>It got some very bad criticism (Reviews&amp;Ratings first page hosts at\nleast 4 reviewers rating this title '1', lowest possible value on\nIMDb), most of which deals with Physics laws bended to screenwriter's\ndesire. <br><br>Well I just want to reassure you that even though I am among the\nnerdiest guys on the Internet, I didn't get annoyed from what I saw.\nNot once. And if you weren't annoyed by Tom Hanks and his boys killing\nalmost an entire German Division before giving up in 'Save Private\nRyan' you won't be annoyed too.<br><br>It's a movie, not a documentary.

{"review": "\nThe story about Mark Watney, an astronaut in the future that is left on\nMars, when his crew mistakingly leave him behind. I had expected huge\nthings from this movie, it started very well, but then it came quite\nboring, there is only so much solo time one man can do on the film. The\nother characters were not too interesting, except for Vincent and\nBruce, the only two likable. Matt Damon is a very good actor, much\nbetter news that he is doing another Jason Bourne film. The Martian is\nwatchable but what is the problem is the ending, it was really badly\ndone, the film was credible up to then. Best thing about the movie were\nthe special effects, the film looks good.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe decadence of Ridley Scott in my opinion. The one who offered us\nsome great movies (\"Allien\" is enough I believe to make the comparison\nand point out the importance of a good scenario and small budget to\ncreate a \"great\" movie). The whole movie hasn't created, to me at\nleast, the feeling of agony and suspense that was meant to create and I\ncannot understand the dithyrambic critics (8.2 IMDb score?).<br><br>More it was a movie like \"Indepedence Day\", where the \"good guys\" win\nnomatter what.....<br><br>A great disappointment from Ridley Scott and a movie that did not offer\nanything new, from a director that has created collosal movies in the\npast (what to count first: Blade Runner, Allien, Gladiator..... 0.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this film on it's opening night, with a group of friends from\nwork. The film's beginning drew me in, and Matt Damon's lighthearted\nhumor was quite amusing.<br><br>That being said, the formulaic plot, lack of character development\noutside of Matt Damon's character, and eventually tiring jokes wore me\nout by the end of the movie. It must've been a decent film, since I did\nfind myself laughing now and then, and I also found myself rooting for\nMatt Damon. That said, it's a highly forgettable flick, and I don't\nunderstand why it's so beloved.<br><br>Watch it if you have the chance, but don't expect an incredible film.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Martian, based on the novel of the same name written by author Andy\nWeir, is an eventful movie that serves both as an epic sci-fi\nadventure, but also provides viewers with some smart laughs. Those are\nwho not that interested in sci-fi will probably end up liking the\nmovie, because it is not unrealistic. Acting wise, Matt Damon puts in\nan excellent performance as the lead, and supporting actors such as\nJessica Chastain, also put in solid performances. Probably one of the\nbest aspects of the film, is that the mood of the movie is quite\noptimistic, considering that the situation of being stuck on mars, is\nquite a scary one, that requires a lot of panic. In Conclusion, The\nmartian is a fun, smart movie, that is likely to be enjoyed by most\naudiences who watch it.\n"},
{"review": "\nUnderwhelming and boring movie, can't understand how it gets so much\nacclaim and good reviews in general. The theme of man overcoming\nchallenges through \"science\" sprinkled with disco music here and there\nto awaken viewers along the way and raise their spirits felt clich\u00e9 and\ndidn't make it for me. The film just felt somewhat void and\nforeseeable. I think it lacked suspense and if I may \"planetary or\nspace awesomeness\", but of course that is not the mood the film aims\nat, so you can blame me for judging it from my expectations rather than\nthan considering the movie in itself. However, to me it seems almost\nlike a movie about Mars had to be made and this is what we got.<br><br>You would expect something special coming from Ridley Scott, or maybe\nnot after the disappointment of Prometheus (for me that film deflated\nat about the equator and contained some odd script and dialogue\nnonsense) What happened to old good space movies?\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm a big Ridley Scott fan and was terribly disappointed. Heard so much\nhype. As other reviewers have written, everything is too convenient.\nDamon's character finds a \"solution\" for everything, or NASA finds\none.Out food? Grow potatoes. Need interstellar communication? Find\nPathfinder. Door blown off pod? Tarp it. It should hold up fine, even\nthough the first spacecraft almost tipped over in a major storm. Tarp\nshould be great.<br><br>Damon is just a series of smug, cutesy lines - amazing how he kept such\na light-hearted attitude left to die on Mars. If that wasn't bad\nenough, add disco music. And so many situations seemed ridiculously\nunbelievable. That's just the tip of the iceberg. For more insight to\nthis lackluster, high-gloss, no soul movie, read the 1 to 5 star\nreviews. The Martian is a loser.\n"},
{"review": "\nOK, this is really a very very bad movie. And on several levels. Matt\nDamon plays awfully bad. Well this is no news, he is an awful actor,\nbut still\u0085He is in this movie so emotionally numb. The scenario is\nreally not suspenseful. Most of the scientific facts are just thrown at\nyour head like if you were totally stupid and know nothing. All the\nscenario is totally unlikely. And I don't speak about the political\ncorrectness (black, Chinese\u0085 everybody is there) that is really an\ninsult to intelligence. Finally I can say that the film had beautiful\nimages. This is the only thing I can say positive. That's all.\nConclusion : this movie is a waste of time. I have already forgotten\nit. Man where are the SF films like Alien\u0085\n"},
{"review": "\nHaving successfully landed on Mars the crew of the Ares III encounter a\nterrific storm which separates one of the astronauts named \"Mark\nWatney\" (Matt Damon) from the rest. Considering him to be dead and in\norder to escape the storm the Ares III launches without him. Once he\nregains consciousness he realizes his plight and decides to try to stay\nalive as long as he can. But with no communication and limited supplies\nhe knows that the odds are steeped very much against him. Now rather\nthan reveal any more I will just say that although it was rather\npredictable and cheesy it was still quite entertaining. Matt Daman, as\nusual, performed in an excellent manner and coupled with the beautiful\n\"Martian\" scenery along with the tension the director (Ridley Scott)\nmanaged to maintain even though the film was well over 2 hours kept the\nfilm from becoming either dull or boring. In any case, I enjoyed this\nmovie and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.\n"},
{"review": "\nA film that has a story, great acting, fantastic visuals (and sets)\nwith humor sprinkled throughout is my kind of movie. The Martian starts\noff with an engaging story. As usual, Matt Damon is impressive. The man\nhas a knack for becoming the character he is playing. This movie really\nis the package deal. There are twists and surprises (that I greatly\nappreciated) but I did find the scattered humorous lines really make\nthe film engaging. It was great to walk away from viewing a movie and\nthink it was a fantastic way to spend the past two hours. I plan on\nreading the book it was based on now too. Personally I found this film\nto be MUCH more interesting than Gravity.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you are not a fan of MacGyver, this two hour plus movie is going to\nfeel like five hours. Other than some moments taken from Mission to\nMars, Apollo 13 and Gravity, Matt Damon plays Robinson Crusoe on Mars.\nIf you believe that millions of devoted fans of NASA would flood Time\nSquare to find out if this movie will have a happy ending, then you can\nbelieve anything. If you love the science and math behind space\nexploration, the Martian is a marvel. If you like your space odyssey to\nhave aliens, laser fights and chase scenes, this movie is not for you.\nUnlike Sam Rockwell's Moon, Matt Damon is not completely alone. Half\nthe movie is Matt only while the other half is filled with a colorful\ncast that you often see in comedies. Overall, the movie helps you to\nsmile from time to time but is far from a comedy...or a musical.\n"},
{"review": "\nPeople go to the cinema to be entertained, not to be schooled by people\nwho have no idea what are they talking about.

It's\nlike all the movies were written by the same people, all the effects\ndone by the same crew, time to change Hollywood! Ridley Scott how could\nyou?

{"review": "\nI don't really understand all the hype behind this movie. Maybe it's\nbecause I've heard the book was so good that this movie created some\nbuzz before its release. I normally enjoy sci fi movies and I am\ngenerally a fan of Ridley Scott. I enjoy being moved by great acting\nperformances and being awed by the mysteriousness and the unknown this\ntype of genre is able to project on the big screen. However, this movie\ndid none of the above for me. Although Matt Damon is an excellent\nactor, it was difficult for me to fully buy into his character. Despite\nbeing alone and stranded on Mars, he lacked emotion and credibility.\nThe other characters in this movie fell flat, too. The biggest\ndisappointments were Kristen Wiig and Jeff Daniels \u0096 it was too one\ndimensional, lacked versatility, and was to clich\u00e9. Actually, the plot\nwas very clich\u00e9 and was very predictable. And the special effects and\naction sequences were far too similar to what we saw in Prometheus. I\nguess I expected more with this cast and director but was left wanting\nso much more.\n"},

Of course, things\ndon't go according to the plan.

{"review": "\nI rented the DVD on a suggestion from a friend and it was really good,\nconsidering the somewhat offbeat humor.

The scenes\nhe's exploring around, he's not exploring but looking for equipment to\nhelp him, so even when he is abandoned on Mars, and that's a big thing\nof course it's just like watching a guy do chores and other random\nstuff. But good movie overall. Just be prepared for something kind of\nlike MacGyver in Space. He is \"science-ing\" this out. I felt the music\nwas good. It felt different. I watched this and was entertained. But\nthis is still not as good as Europa Report in my humble opinion.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie started just like any other adventure movie. The trailer\npromised a really intriguing story line. This movie is based on a book\nand for me many things were made differently than the book. Matt Damon\nwas usual a perfect choice for the role. He had to portray the struggle\nand willingness to survive alone in an absolutely no mans land. I liked\nthe acting of everyone but the plot line was not very interesting. It\nwas very common and obvious that the crew who left him will go and save\nhim at some point and everything will be alright at the end. I watch\nthe 1080p version (i think) and the VFX was magnificent and was true to\nthe story. All in all, it was a good time pass movie, not at all boring\nand fun to watch\n"},
{"review": "\nSeeing that the movie was over 2 hrs long, and knowing that the person\nwas going to be stuck on the planet by their self for the majority, I\ndidn't have high hopes for it. Usually these types of movies are\nboring. Not a lot of writers can pull this off. This movie was really\ngood tho. A group of us watched it and really enjoyed. There were some\nthings they failed to explain, that we collectively came up with our\nown answer for. Other than that, it was great. I never felt bored or\nleft waiting for more. Overall, I feel it was very well written,\nproduced and acted. Well worth the watching. Some people on here have\ngriped that it was 'predictable', but then, most movies are. Who ever\nwatched Star Wars with the thought that Vader would ultimately win???\nWho ever watched Star Trek thinking that Kirk wouldn't find a way to\nsave the day?

The scenes containing the rocketry were\nbrilliantly filmed and added the necessary element that made this a\ncomplete movie. I would recommend this to a friend, and if one were to\nrent this I would suggest the blue ray option because this movie\ndeserved the crisp sharp benefits that blue ray offers. I thought that\nMark Damon's performance was one of his best. I don't know how much of\nthe science this picture contains is in fact authentic, but I really\ndid not expect it to be.

{"review": "\n(68%) A well made space survival adventure that mixes Apollo 13,\nCastaway and Interstellar in a very watchable treat that marks a\nlighter entry into Ridley Scott's filmography. The pacing is sharp, the\nperformances from the strong cast are solid and this never becomes\nanything other than a likable sit. Unlike something such as Castaway\nthe plot is more required to follow both the captive (Matt Damon) and\nthe rest of the cast who's only objective is to try and help rescue\nhim, so there is a fair amount of switching between the two focal\npoints rather than pure Matt Damon in space trying to get by. Without\ndoubt this is a band apart from the lesser films of the year, but I\ndoubt it will top my list mainly because for me it came and went\nwithout hardly any lasting impact. So by the end it is enjoyable while\nit lasts with plenty of heart and entertainment value, but it didn't\nsend as many shock-waves upon me as it did so many others.

I\nthought the movie was slow on occasion and definitely too long as a\nwhole. I also wasn't that impressed by most of the acting. Other than\nMatt Damon, Michael Pe\u00f1a, and maybe some of the NASA crew, the acting\nwasn't that good, and the dialogue didn't feel real. This was my second\ntime seeing The Martian. I didn't think it was as good the second time.\nThe main reason was probably that I didn't have the suspense that I did\nthe first time I saw it. A lot of the enjoyment you'll get out of this\nmovie is from not knowing what is going to happen and following Mark\nWatney and his journey of what to do next.\n"},
{"review": "\nIn this movie Matt Damon, was left behind by his crew on Mars. He has\nto survive until NASA can get the materials to bring him back home.\nThis whole movie is based off his survival, so you wan't to get that\naspect of the film right. I had mixed feelings on this aspect. I\nenjoyed and found how he survived very neat. Yes I realize this is a\nsci-fi movie, but it still felt very drawn out, unrealistic, and at\ntimes it felt predictable. Besides this there was many things that I\nliked. I loved Mars in this movie, from the dust and dullness of this\nplanet. You couldn't help, but like this planet. The acting was pretty\ngood all the way around, especially from Damon and his space crew. I\nliked the balance of Mars and what they are doing back on earth. It set\na good pace for the movie and was helpful when it started to get boring\non Mars.Loved seeing the efforts to save him back on earth, very nice\nand believable.The rescue scene was very climatic and I enjoyed it.\nStill was predictable though. Overall this was a good movie, but\ndefinitely could of been great with some changes.\n"},
{"review": "\nGreat story telling. Considering this movie was about just one person\nfor half the movie, the fact that the content is scientifically distant\nfor 75% of the viewing population, and that there were no real\nvillains, it is really amazing what they did with it. Matt Damon's\nperformance was engaging and delightful, and the rest of the cast was\nstellar with their various quirks. The writers and directors also had a\nfun time exploring human dynamics. One cannot help but wonder how\nscientifically accurate some of the content is but at some point, I got\nlost in enjoying what was simply a very well put together movie. Great\njob guys...\n"},
{"review": "\nThe idea of this film is not a new one, of the potential to inhabit\nMars but this is one of the first films that has taken this concept to\nthe next level and provided a brilliantly acted, thrilling film that\nkeeps you on the edge of your seat.

There was not much\nthat I found that could be flawed in this film, I feel that the film\nwas slightly exaggerated in terms of the science but that is expected\nof a film in the sc-fi genre. Furthermore I feel some of the supporting\nactors while good could have been better if played by other actors. But\noverall this film was excellently written, the lead role could not have\nbeen done much better and the film was produced to a very high\nstandard. I would recommend watching this film on your own or with a\ngroup of friends.\n"},

The same people who could not get their heads\naround characters like Captain Ng in Aloha being of mixed race because\nshe looked white seem to be totally on board with the premise that not\nonly will we get to Mars as a matter of regular space travel, but that\nMatt Damon gets there, survives on the products of a garden he creates\nin the most hostile of environments and then gets rescued by being\nretrieved from deep space in a one in a million shot space snag.<br><br>And what is it with people these days who think we can get to Mars when\nwe haven't gotten back to our own Moon since 1972?<br><br>Film was good, but sci-fi preposterous.\n"},
{"review": "\nGreat film, showcasing the technological advancements, however taking\ninto account many of the maneuvers are very much questionable takes\ncertain factual elements of the film and turns them into fictional.\nMars has been reported in many observational studies that devastating\nstorms occur often what we failed to see in this film is the amount of\ntime spent on mars with hardly any major interruptions. The film is\nmostly focused on NASA and how patriotic the whole concept is, based on\nthe novel which was a great read the film defies many laws of space\ntravel. having said all that I encourage viewers to watch the film and\nform their own opinion about the lack of factual implications. A recent\nfilm directed by Christopher Nolan in the name of Interstellar that\nshowcases a great deal of theoretical physics, I could only imagine the\noutcome of this movie if it were directed by C.Nolan who is a master\nvisualization.\n"},
{"review": "\nI generally don't like \"one-man movies\" i.e movies which revolve around\none person most of the time, so I approached The Martian with cautious.<br><br>It turns up it's a good movie with good cast and overall solid plot\nbut, in my opinion, it is longer then it should be.

{"review": "\nAs much as I loved the novel \"The Martian\" by Andy Weir, I'm\nunimpressed by its cinematic adaptation. The story in the book is all\nabout details: the amount of credible technical information offered in\nthe original novel every time Watney (the astronaut stranded on Mars)\nhas a new idea to survive on Mars is the very backbone of the story and\nits defining style.<br><br>Unfortunately, when you have to adapt such kind of material to the big\nscreen, you must remove most of the technicalities, otherwise people\nwould fell asleep in theaters. Ridley Scott made a good film, supported\nby decent acting and visuals. But the geekish flavor of the book, which\nmakes it great and unique, is almost totally lost.

{"review": "\nThis is an awesome movie, the story line is tantalizing, the acting is\nsweet, the science is amazing and everything is just awesome.<br><br>with a few exception, one notable for me is that it seems that he is\neating something or drinking something the majority of times that we\nsee him, that tend to be a bit annoying, its not like all you do on\nmars is eat, drink, and...well... eat more...<br><br>there was to much emphasis on food and eating and consumtion and to\nlittle on the fact he could have done some amazing discoveries on mars,\nit was not like he spent every waking moment from the time of the\n\"accident\" to the rescue on thinking of ways to survive, there was\nample opportunity to do real science as well and there was a little to\nlittle emphasis on that.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"The Martian\" is a nice film about an Astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt\nDamon), who is left behind on Mars after a storm hits him and his crew\nand he is believed to be dead, but miraculously he survives and has to\nlearn to live on the planet until someone rescues him. In a way this\nfilm reminds me of \"Gravity\" with Sandra Bullock except for the fact\nthat Sandra Bullock's character had to do almost everything on her own\nwithout the help from anyone after she got stranded in outer space, now\nthat's not taking away from the intensity of this film just because\nMark Watney (Matt Damon) had some help from earth. He still had to\nsurvive in the hostile conditions of Mars. With Matt Damon, Jessica\nChastain, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as part of the cast you couldn't go\nwrong. These are some very talented actors and they were perfect for\nthis film. If you liked \"Gravity\" you'll love this film. It was well\nwritten and had great visual effects and the plot will keep you\ninterested from beginning to end. This is a great one and I would\nrecommend it.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis is partially a Robinson Crusoe story for 21 century.. A man all by\nhimself trying to survive.

How do the earth people\ninstantanuously communicate with the Martian when it should take the\nlight about 4 min to get there and 4 min to come back. This seems such\na basic error that it makes you wonder if Ridley was in sound mind when\nhe made this movie.<br><br>2. How does the Martian ( Mat Damon) get a spacecraft and fuel to lift\nfrom Mars.

Matt Damon and the support cast\nwere fantastic in this film, Jeff Daniels played such a good part it\ntook me a while to realize he was in Dumb &amp; Dumber!. Easy to watch, and\nthe sort of film that the family can watch on a Sunday after a roast\ndinner. It actually makes you think, will we ether make it to mars? or\nin habit another planet?

{"review": "\nBlockbusters are only good once in a while. \"The Martian\" adds its name\nto the list of boring Hollywood adventures for its lack of creativity,\nits huge cast who give dull performances, and its weak attempt at\ngiving the eyes something spectacular to look at.
