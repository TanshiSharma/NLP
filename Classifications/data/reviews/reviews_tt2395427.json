{"review": "\nbeing a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited\nfor him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was\npretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to\nbreathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots\nto be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.<br><br>So, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should\nlove it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which\nis a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they\nwould usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is\nall over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the\nfilm, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another\nindependent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't\nuse the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out\neverybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's\nthat are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not\nsee all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated. <br><br>The fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw\nit in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one\ntoo, and it doesn't even change a little.<br><br>Overall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by\nStudio as Josh has stated so many times now.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's quite an achievement to make a boring Superhero Movie so well done\nto all involved.<br><br>Remember the first average at best Avengers Movie? A baddie in control\nof the Tesseract uses it and an alien army to try and take over the\nplanet. Whilst this is happening the Avengers are brought together\nwhere there are a few internal issues involving having their minds\ncontrolled &amp;/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat\nthe alien threat.<br><br>Well.... <br><br>This movie is about a baddie who was in control of the Tesseract which\nthen becomes the catalyst for a new robot baddie and it's robot army\ntrying to destroy the planet. This again creates a few internal issues\ninvolving the Avengers having their minds controlled &amp;/or beating each\nother up, before joining forces to beat the robot threat. <br><br>It's just the same movie repackaged (again) which tries to be\nintelligent but comes across as dull. <br><br>Some of the Avengers presence have little or no no point in being in\nthe movie (Hawkeye just being there for example to offer the others a\nweekend retreat to go to).<br><br>But as with the first movie and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War\nit seems as long as the movie is crammed full of as many Superheroes as\npossible and they all kick off at some point during the movie, then\nthis is enough to keep an audience happy.<br><br>Stick with the X-Men at least they make an effort!\n"},
{"review": "\n...Phase 2 of the Marvel movies had been batting .500 for me. I did not\nenjoy Iron Man 3 or Thor: Dark World, but really dug Guardians of the\nGalaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier (Cap 2 is probably the best\nfilm in the entire Marvel series!)<br><br>Based on that, I don't think I am surprised that I came out of Age of\nUltron with mixed feelings. Overall it is a solid entry, but it is by\nno means flawless. <br><br>The good:<br><br>Really liked the intro of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. I liked the\nhorror-movie tropes tied to Scarlet Witch (she is a Witch afterall!)\nand Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver had a lot of personality.<br><br>The action, of course, was great. And Hawkeye actually had something to\ndo in this film. <br><br>The Vision: They did such an incredible job building mystique around\nthis character.<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Wasn't a fan of that extended scene at the Farm. That stopped the movie\ncold. I know some people say \"It was necessary for character\ndevelopment\", but the previous films had done such a poor job of giving\nHawkeye any character that seeing him on the Farm did absolutely\nnothing for me.<br><br>The romance: Ugh. Talk about forced. I like Ruffalo's Banner. I really\ndo. I was surprised how much i did in the first Avengers, cause i'm\nusually not a Ruffalo fan. But I just did not see any chemistry between\nRuffalo and Scar-Jo. And where was the build-up to this? Last time we\nsaw these 2 together Hulk was trying to smash Black Widow. <br><br>Marvel needs to work on their female-story lines.<br><br>Ultron was kind of a lame villain. I don't think there was enough\nbuild-up for him. He just sorta showed up and was evil.<br><br>Overall: Is it worth seeing in the theatre? Yes of course it is. But it\nis not without its flaws, and sure doesn't top Cap 2.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie takes a long time to gain any steam, with a lot of all talk\nand no action in the first half of the movie. There is also little\nsuspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring\ntheir next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project\ncalled Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie's\nbackdrop.<br><br>The Ultron project goes horribly wrong and the machine takes a mind of\nits own, threatening to rid the world of humans in attempts to \"save\nthe world\" - something we've heard before.<br><br>We get to see action slowly trickle in during the second half of the\nmovie slowly - lots of crazy CGI action during the rumbling climax.\nThis film's plot sets the story for the next film, Captain America:\nCivil War, in motion. However, I thought this film overall lacked the\nentertainment value due to its extremely slow plot and lackluster\nstory.<br><br>Grade D\n"},
{"review": "\nDisappointing, it summarizes Avengers: Age of Ultron, the film is not\nbad, it's cool just cool, it is frustrating because all the world\nexpected to be better than the first Avengers Ultron which is one of\nthe best villains of the Marvel Comics he is simply poorly executed in\nthis movie, really the film beginning excited about the action scenes,\nthe effects are excellent, the CGI movie is hardly exaggerated, Mercury\nand another character very badly used, as the scarlet witch for a\nfuture in this universe Marvel, the film is unnecessary scenes, the\njokes are always in the wrong time it breaks the film's climax, and the\nend where the Hulk flees the ship hope to explain in the Civil War\nfilm, now the worst thing in the movie, Hawkeye it has more space than\nowed it gets to be ridiculous, he can tip the witch and the mercury\nthat was really ridiculous, the final scene of the movie was good most\nnot enough to thrill, Avengers: Age of Ultron is not even bad, far from\nit, more we expected so that was better than the first to disappoint.\nNote 6.9\n"},
{"review": "\nI expected Age of Ultron to be a worthy sequel to the glorious\nAvengers.When I went to the cinema I expected to see something\nimpressive and innovative.I was completely wrong.The movie is a\ncomplete mess, with pointless filler scenes.Right from the beginning of\nthe movie they showed a combat scene out of nowhere and without ANY\nexplanations whatsoever.They showed Tony using his Iron Man suit when\nin Iron Man 3 he destroyed all of them.How did Lokis scepter fall into\nbad guys's hands ? In order to understand it you need to watch the\nseries ''Agents of SHIELD'', witch is completely unacceptable as far as\ni'm concerned.Later on they show Ultron,Vision, and Scarlet witch whose\nabilities didn't even explain ! How did they come up with that idea ?\nNot all people read comics neither watch the series.Take me for\nexample, during the movie i felt so empty which was the last feeling i\nexpected from the movie.Even the finale witch was supposed to be\n''epic'' was so anti-climatic and strange.Don't get me wrong, i LOVED\nthe first Avengers movie, however. this one is just a waste of time and\nmoney.It is by far the worst movie of 2015 and the worst sequel i have\never watched.\n"},
{"review": "\nLong story short--way too much destruction that was often difficult to\nfollow at times. And who ends up paying for all that destruction?\nStark? The government? Or both? Without question, the cast was awesome\nas usual, including the voice of Ultron, James Spader. The slow-mo\nscenes of everyone fighting was very cool for sure. But the scene where\nthe Hulk goes berserk was way too long. I would have cut the time in\nhalf on that part. I was getting somewhat bored after a while.<br><br>The characters were great; the story was good and I loved the\nstate-of-the-art technology. Enjoyed seeing Paul Bettany (Jarvis), and\nnow that he's an Avenger, hopefully, we'll see more of him. Aaron\nTaylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen were wonderful additions to the\ncast. Too bad Pietro gets killed but at least Wanda was spared.<br><br>The trance scene with Thor, that is, the background scene, was too\nvague, too quick. The camera shots on the whole, in my opinion, were\nspotty. It was hard trying to make out some of the scenes--on the whole\nit was a bit too busy! Sorry! Special effects were great, though.<br><br>I have ambivalent feelings about this movie. The whole movie seemed a\nbit choppy to me. I'm rating it 6 stars.\n"},
{"review": "\nI felt that there was a disconnection with the other parts. For\nexample, Thor's return is never shown not in this and not in Thor's\nmovies. We learn that he has seen Jane after coming but we are not\nshown that, seems as parts are missing. Also we are not shown how the\navengers got contacted and got together. We learn from the Winter\nSolder movie that they have to destroy the centres of Hydra but that\nwas just Steve and Natasha, they never mentioned that they will call\nthe others or keep the avengers alive. This is also feels like a part\nmissing. Their get together. <br><br>I am not gonna talk about life lessons or plausibility because its a\nsuper hero movie and those are pretty obvious how they are in these\nmovies. I must say however that this part was more concerned with\ncharacters dilemmas, their fears. It is an attempt to develop them, let\nthe audience understand them better. A missed target here because\nfirstly, as I said its an super hero movie, the characters are super\nheroes and no matter their dilemmas because of that they will always\ncome back to the same ending and secondly, they did it poorly and\nshortly and it just took a lot of movies time without making any\nimpact. <br><br>The story line is impressive however and that's what a movie like this\nshould have, more wow moments and twists and surprises than character's\ndilemmas. They story is well told with action scenes and fast\ndevelopment and the feeling that you don't know if they all are gonna\nmake it which was new. What I like most about the story is how the\nstory keeps developing through all these series and you can sense that\nit is going to build into something quite exciting. Makes you more\ncurious about the other parts.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have to say, I watched this movie several times but not for the\nreasons you might think. I got an absolute kick out of the cynical,\nsnarky, hilarious, egotistical, fun that James Spader had with Ultron.\nWhen I found out that he was the voice behind it, I kept watching and\nlistening to the way that he totally immersed himself and embodied the\nrole. It was genius. I got no strings to hold me down. <br><br>The only comic books I ever read growing up were Archie. Gasp, choke,\ngasp. No Superman, Spiderman, Iron Man, etc. So for me, the characters\nare larger than life. And since I have no point of reference to compare\nthem to or to critique them against, their personalities are formed and\nintroduced to me on the screen. I learn their backgrounds and history\nfrom watching the movie. <br><br>Realizing that all of the characters in these movies are comic book\ncharacters, should make you also realize that you can't take these\nmovies too seriously. While I learned a lot about our heroes in this\nmovie and there is much more to any of them than meets the eye, they\nare still 2 dimensional for me.There is not enough information to flesh\nthem out so to speak, but I'm sure that will come in future\nmovies.However, Stan Lee and his cameos are always nice to see. <br><br>The next thing is to just enjoy the fun and the dialog. Plot?? Who\ncares. Acting?? Meh. For me, it's fun, it's cool, it's entertaining,\nand frankly worth the money I paid to buy the DVD. I am collecting all\nin the Marvel Universe and will continue watching until I am old and\ngray. Well, older and grayer than I am now. <br><br>For this movie, I do not believe that I wasted 2 hours of my life.\n"},
{"review": "\nWell,Avengers 2 was probably more awaited than the first one,but\nunfortunately,it doesn't quite live up to my expectations.Of course it\nis good to see our heroes go at it again,but the villain is\ninsignificant and is beat at the drop of a hat.Another baseless\narmy,this time,with bots! Sound exciting? The playful tone of the movie\nmake for some fun moments,but stop the movie from having any sort of\nmystery or suspense.The CGI is top notch,and the destruction effects\nseem realistic.The new cast members are nice,particularly Johnson and\nOlsen.James Spader voices Ultron brilliantly,but sadly,the villain is\njust weak.This movie is good.Overall it is enjoyable,but I expect\nbetter from Marvel.\n"},
{"review": "\nAvengers: Age of Ultron is my favorite movie, it has incredible action\nthat blew my mind away. The movie had many surprises having Vision as a\npowerful and peaceful avenger and the hulk-buster that was a awesome\nand epic. I thought that Ultron was a dark, complicated, and emotional\nvillain that made me think of him as my favorite villain. Ultron was\nextremely powerful with unique abilities that would make him one of the\navengers dangerous threats. The beginning was fantastic with the movie\nsetting the plot and then ending with tons of action and excitement\nleaving me with wanting to see more. Scarlet Witch and QuickSilver were\namazing, each having formidable abilities and a tragic story. Captain\nAmerica was heroic and brave and we got to see and know more about\nHawkeye and it made me think how awesome he is. Black Widow and the\nHulk showed a big love interest that made the movie better. Avengers:\nAge of Ultron is my favorite movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie has its flaws as with any superhero movie. I however enjoyed\nthis one more so than Avengers (2012). The action was tighter and more\nswift. The story however was nothing new, but very engaging dealing\nwith an AI that goes rogue and watching the seeds of disassembling take\nroot among the Avengers. The characterization is some of the best I\nhave seen of any superhero movie.<br><br>Now the bone I have with this movie is that it doesn't take the risk in\nshowing the reality that failure can happen. The ending for this movie\npresented the Avengers with an impossible situation that involved\neither saving the human race at the expense of a failed state or allow\nthe extinction of humanity. This was a pivotal moment in superhero era\nwhere the superhero will have to face a disastrous situation the\nAvengers and the world would never recover from. Instead we get a\ngeneric ending and the Avengers once again saving the day. We could\nhave gotten a movie where the superheroes fail. That's what I was\nhoping to see as that would not only change the dynamics of the\nAvengers, but the dynamics of superhero movies to come.<br><br>Ultron was great but I was hoping for more use out of him in how he\naffects the world structure. When it says Age of Ultron I thought\nUltron was going to revolutionize the world. I was hoping for world\nimplications of his existence nothing short of economic catastrophe,\ninternet shutdown, launch of nuclear weapons codes, wars, massive human\nloss, and of course the murder of the human race at the hands of Ultron\na la robotic army.<br><br>AOU is worth the time and is still a fun ride. Just hoped that the\nAvengers failed this time around.\n"},
{"review": "\nGood: Action scenes were great, along with the stunning visual effects.\nFor a Marvel movie, there's no surprise there.<br><br>Bad: Some of the action was repetitive and kinda dumb. A bunch of\nminions fighting the Avengers led by a big mastermind? Where have we\nseen that before? Banal might be too strong of a word (that was just\nfor the sake of alliteration) but it sure approaches it. The character\ndevelopment is obviously lacking, and so is depth. Humor is a bit\ncheesy, and while I did laugh along with the audience it just doesn't\nfit. There is not a sense of seriousness to the fight, which is why I\ntend to prefer DC movies.<br><br>Verdict: I did enjoy the movie. Not saying I didn't. But it is just not\ngripping at all. If you haven't watched it yet I would recommend you\nsee it but I'm not gonna watch it more than once.\n"},
{"review": "\nAge of Ultron is a worthy follow up to the first Avengers, though it\nultimately is bogged down, ever so slightly, by its inconsistent tone\nand muddled stakes.<br><br>Marvel movies have become almost their own genre at this point. They\nall follow a similar rhythm, yet somehow still seem to retain their own\nvoice. It seems to me that the best, thus far, have been the original\nAvengers and the 2nd Captain America, both of which are considerably\nbetter than this. Though Ultron offers somewhat compelling moral\nphilosophy and the usual excellent choreography, the tone of Ultron as\na villain is ultimately too comical to succeed. Furthermore, though the\nelimination of humanity is certainly high stakes, this movie\ninexplicably takes place in a small, out of the way Eastern European\ncountry that we don't care about, partially because it doesn't exist.\nBeyond this, given Tony Stark's seemingly endless resources, we are\nleft to wonder what actually matters.<br><br>What works here, though, is the usual stuff that works for Marvel. The\ninterplay between the Avengers. The fight choreography is top notch as\nalways. Jess Whedon directs clear and concise battles; it is always\nevident who is fighting who, and how much progress is being made. James\nSpader mostly works as Ultron; the man is a natural talent. His voice\nis haunting, and his talent possesses a tangible texture that is miles\nahead of the other actors here. To be fair, James Spader is miles ahead\nof MOST actors. The hero aptly named Vision is another standout, as are\nthe twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.<br><br>At the end of the day, though, even if this is less than you wanted\nfrom an Avengers sequel, it's still a quite good movie. It's still\nextremely palatable, even if it does go down a little easier than you'd\nlike. More significantly, it's still miles better than anything DC has\ndone with Superman or Batman. <br><br>7 out of 10.\n"},
{"review": "\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015) <br><br>*** (out of 4) <br><br>Tony (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Bruce (Mark Ruffalo) are nearing\ncompletion of Ultron in hopes of bringing world peace but something\ngoes wrong and soon what seems like an unstoppable force has the\nAvengers on the brink of ending.<br><br>AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON wasn't nearly as good as the first film in the\nseries but there's still plenty to enjoy here as director Joss Whedon\nmanages to keep the action scenes full of energy and there are enough\nbits of comedy to make the film enjoyable to watch. With that said, I'd\nbe lying if I said the story itself was anything overly special and at\ntimes the extended running time seems to be going on for too long.<br><br>There's still enough great action here to make the film worth sitting\nthrough. This includes the non-stop action scenes all of which seem to\nget bigger and better than the previous one. The ending is something I\nwon't spoil but it contains quite a bit of imagination and it really\ncomes to life. As I've said before, it's really amazing how far CGI has\ncome over the past decade. Whereas at one time you could always tell\nwhat's fake that's not the case any more. The CGI flawlessly blends in\nwith the live action to where it blends perfectly together.<br><br>Another major plus for the film is that the casting is simply perfect.\nBy this point in the series you know that Downey is just flawless as\nTony Stark/Iron Man but the rounding cast is also terrific. Chris\nHemsworth, Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner,\nSamuel L. Jackson, Don Cheadle and Elizabeth Olsen are all very good\nand certainly help bring these characters to life.\n"},
{"review": "\nI tend to enjoy the Marvel movies and animated movies / TV series when\nI can catch them. Unfortunately I caught Next Avengers: Heroes of\nTomorrow on TV once, and that, coupled with the name Age of Ultron, led\nme to expect something like that animated movie or Days of Future Past:\nthat Ultron takes over and there's a desperate struggle to overthrow\nhim. One early trailer I saw also seemed to enforce such an impression.<br><br>Unfortunately Ultron turned out to be a rather impotent villain. He's\nfull of potential danger, but doesn't manage to realise any of that\npotential. The trailers made the movie look like the threat is a lot\nbigger than it was. Pretty much every danger in this movie is short\nterm and thwarted without too much problem. I kept waiting for\nsomething truly dramatic to happen, but it never did. There's no Age of\nUltron in this movie, not even a glimpse of it, and for me that was\ndisappointing enough that I didn't enjoy the movie much.<br><br>There's decent action, drama and humour, it's not a badly made movie,\nbut the villain is weak, and even the ultimate danger, the death of the\nhuman race, is less dramatic than potential subjugation, which is what\nmost villains go for.\n"},
{"review": "\nI liked this movie better than the first Avengers film. The topic of\nsingularity makes the story more interesting than the first one. The\naction was very fast and well done, it kept the movie upbeat and\nthrilling.

After all the\nMarvel movies i've watched i still don't feel like I really know the\ncharacters as well as I should. Out of all the Avengers i think i enjoy\nThor the most, because Chris Hemsworth looks like a God, he looks\nroyal, best casting ever.<br><br>I thought 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' was enjoyable and fun, but not\nreally life-changing or original.

{"review": "\nIf there were not an audience for Marvel comic heroes than clearly\nthese films would not be made, to answer one other reviewer although I\nsympathize with him somewhat. The world is indeed an infinitely more\ncomplex place than the world of Marvel comics with clearly identifiable\nheroes and villains. But I get the feeling that from Robert Downey, Jr.\non down the organizer and prime mover as Iron Man behind the Avengers\nthese players do love doing these roles because it's a lot of fun. If\nthey didn't show that spirit of fun to the audience than these films\nwould never be made.<br><br>So in that spirit of fun Avengers: Age Of Ultron comes before us and\neveryone looks like they're having a good time saving the world. A\ncomputer program got loose and took form in this dimension named Ultron\nand James Spader who is completely unrecognizable is running amuck in\nthe earth. No doubt Star Trek fans took notice that this guy's mission\nis to cleanse the earth much like that old earth probe NOMAD which got\nits programming mixed up in that classic Star Trek prime story.

It's pointless describing\nanything in more detail even if I understood it: the plot's\ndeliberately barmy but engrossing, with cgi cartoonery used as it was\nalways meant to be used - with many variations we've seen it all before\nand with many more variations being presently dreamed up expect to\nagain and again. As with the first film there are many iconic comic\nbooky scenes for posterising.

Ultron\nis perfectly voiced by James Spader to bring the menacing character to\nlife and truly move you to fear what his intentions may be.

{"review": "\nThe Avengers Age of Ultron (if you can even call this \"movie\" such\nwithout putting prefix \"Fail\" somewhere in the title) is one of, if not\nthe most overrated, lackluster, contentless, and uninspiring superhero\nsequels that for the past ten years. (Still not as bad and\nunintelligibly insulting as Iron Man 2. But close.)<br><br>Mainly because this movie does not deserves anything from what was\nascribed to it. Many claim that it's better than the original. Which,\nto be fair, doesn't say much, considering that I thought the original\nAvengers was an okay movie.(And that comes from a die-hard comic book\nfanboy whose been reading Avengers titles since late 90s) But this\nmovie, even despite the fact that I don't love the first movie, is way\nbelow the first movie. The Avengers Age of Ultron has a poorly scripted\nand poorly thought-out plot that gives no investigation to the actual\nstory. It has poorly written while decently acted characters. Captain\nAmerica is the most uninteresting and uninspiring character in the\nwhole film, even considering the fact that he is supposed to be a\nleader and the core of the group. <br><br>But it doesn't say much, since every character in this film was bland\nand uninspiring. It relied way too much on the overused and formulaic\nhumor that most of the time feels out of the place. And, of course,\nsince it's Marvel Studios, we have YET another bland, uninteresting\nvillain with weak motives (which is a standard for any MCU movie at\nthis point). List goes on and on. And there is no excuse for this movie\nto be they way it is, like, for example, \"This movie was meant to be\nfun. It's not supposed to be taken seriously\". <br><br>Well, in this sense, I'm taking seriously the fact that most people\noveracting and overpraising dull and uninspiring movies like this.<br><br>Overall, not worth it. I guess I will stick reading old reprints of\nKurt Busiek's Avengers run to restore my love for these characters\nafter I saw the movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nAvengers:Age of Ultron is one of the final movies in marvel phase 2 and\nwhile not as great as the first one,this movie is still very good. The\naction in this movie is truly spectacular and the visual effects are\nreally good and believable throughout.This movie is filled with\nfighting sequences from the very beginning until the end.And I love all\nof them especially the end battle where the stakes are really high and\na few emotional moments. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are some of the\nnew additions and they are very awesome and well done.I honestly\nthought that Quicksilver is not going to be good after what I saw on\nX-Men DOFP but he is great here too,and so is the actor who portrays\nhim. I love the group talks,seeing them get mad at each other and\nhating/loving is just so much fun and interesting.Also this movie is\nfilled with laughs and comedic moments everywhere,which I truly\nappreciate. As about the main villain,Ultron,in my opinion,he was very\nwell done.I really liked him,and his sarcastic jokes.which I found\nfunny every single time.He is mesmerizing and not forgettable at\nall.His intentions very understandable and the only problem with him\nwas his creation,which felt rushed but besides that he is a very good\nvillain. There are some things that don't quiet work here,and other\nthings that they did which just feel like they are setting up for the\nnext movies to come in the marvel universe,but these are small flaws\nand passable ones because this movie overall is very well done and\ninteresting until the very end.\n"},
{"review": "\nAge of Ultron is a tiresome flick. The characters are the same as\nexpected but Iron Man has become more snobbish and self centered. The\ncharacter has gone over the top with his abilities to the point where\nthe writers of the script give him carte blanche which makes Tony Stark\nin to an annoying 4 yr old.<br><br>The Hulk is better CG, which is a good thing, but now he isn't the same\nBruce Banner who has uncontrolled rage and then forgets every thing he\ndid while as The Hulk. The writers have had to change his character\nbecause, uncontrolled, he becomes a loose canon. You can't give him any\nreal dialog. Which ruins the character for me because I grew up with\nhim being this blind rage of power going off to smash puny bad guys\nwhile saving good people who are scared of him.<br><br>Marvel has become this lack luster pile of poop which is pushing out\ncrappy movie after crappy movie to cash in on the popularity of comic\nbook characters. This has caused movies like Age of Ultron to stink.<br><br>There are some serious plot holes in the script but I'm not going to\ndwell on it. With out them the movie is still sub-par. The supporting\ncast is pushed through the movie like a scrap meat being put through a\ngrinder.<br><br>Captain America is flat. Barton is a worthless character. Black Widow\nis only eye candy. Thor is Thor, I honestly don't think they could\nscrew him up. Nick Fury is... terrible. This Vision is too limited. <br><br>The creators of these movies keep trying to cram too much in to the\nstory when it took dozens of issues to build up just one character. Too\nmuch is lost on The Vision and his backstory by shoving him in to the\nfinal ten minutes of the movie as a escape for the writers.<br><br>I watched Age of Ultron on Amazon and it took less than five minutes of\nthe movie to make me want to start fast forwarding.

I also never really thought\nmuch of Scarlett as an actor, but her scene at the beginning with the\nlullaby really showed an incredible range of emotions in just a small\nscene with great subtly. All of this is a result of great writing, both\nin story line and dialog, along with everyone of the actors being first\nrate. I'm glad to finally see comic book movies reaching the\nintelligence of their source material. I'm not a comic book geek but a\nmovie lover, so I don't have any of the preconceived prejudices.

{"review": "\nAvengers: The Age of Ultron is the sequel to the fourth highest\ngrossing movie of all time. At the risk of over-hyping it any more, I\ncan say it's probably the best Marvel movie to date. It manages to be\naction-packed, dramatic and even very funny in all the right places.<br><br>After the Avengers lead a successful raid against a Hydra outpost, Tony\nStark (Robert Downey Jr) revives his secret peacekeeping program Ultron\n(voiced by James Spader) to help safeguard the planet from evil.\nHowever, Ultron interprets the idea of keeping Earth safe as a need to\neradicate humankind from existence. Ultron shortly escapes from Stark's\nlaboratory to act out its mission and it's up to the Avengers, along\nwith their new allies, the twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and\nScarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to stop Ultron from carrying out this\ngenocidal act.<br><br>Even though it is darker than the first film, Avengers: The Age of\nUltron is still able to capture the charm and humour from its main\ncharacters that we have grown to love over the years. Tony Stark is\nstill as witty as ever, delivering his trademark hilarious one-liners\nand Hawkeye's (Jeremy Renner) scenes have some of the most poignant\nmoments in any Marvel film. But perhaps the biggest surprise were the\ntwins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who played a much more important\nrole than I thought they would. There's rarely a dull moment.<br><br>I rate it 9/10, a bit higher than its predecessor, which I rated\n8.5/10.\n"},

It's up to the Avengers to stop them but\nhe's helped by the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver\n(Aaron Taylor-Johnson).<br><br>This sequel is just terrible. The script is kind of vague in specifics\nabout why Ultron hates humans and the Avengers so much. Also the\ndialogue here is TERRIBLE! No actor could put over the lines these\npeople are given. So, understandably, almost all the acting is bad.\nOnly Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy\nRenner (as Hawkeye) give good performances. Worst of all the three new\nsuperheroes--Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and The Vision--are very badly\nintroduced and poorly used. Also the movie is far too long at almost\n150 minutes and is more boring than exciting. Yes the special effects\nare flawless and there are a few very exciting and long action\nsequences but they can't save the movie. At the end the movie takes a\ndisastrous turn and turns in a Transformers like movie! Boring and\npointless with bad acting and dialogue. I give it a 5 for the effects\nand action.\n"},
{"review": "\nI went to see the new Avengers movie the opening weekend. There was a\npacked theater and you could feel the excitement. I heard many Ooos and\nAHss during the movie as well as laughter during the funny moments. I\nliked the movie not only for the obvious content but also for the many\nsurprises and \"Easter eggs\" spread around for the comic book fans. I\nwas very happy that the X-Mens Magnetos children, Scarlet Witch and\nQuicksilver were in it. Marvel was not allowed to call them mutants in\nthe movie by agreement with Fox studios. Their first appearance in the\ncomic books were in the Uncanny X-Men #4 back in 1963.I felt this was a\nfantastic move in the right direction for the marvel universe. Fans\neven got to see the high rise building under construction that was used\non the cover of the Fantastic Four # 26 when the FF teamed up with the\nAvengers to fight the Hulk. So, those seemingly small things put in by\nmarvel put in throughout the movie is the reason some critics rated the\nmovie average as opposed to those who rated it great; many people\nsimply did not understand what was going on in the plot or in the\nbackground, hence causing confusion and in some cases even\ndisappointment. Why does marvel do this? Because they are confident\ntelling their stories in their own way. And marvel of course, set up\nthe next Avengers movie by showing a villain a few minutes into the\nfinal credits. In closing, I recommend seeing this movie at the theater\nas soon as possible and maybe even watching it again at a later date to\nabsorb it all.\n"},

The last time I enjoyed a movie this\nmuch was the last time these characters assembled. Again, they managed\nto deliver a remarkable cool factor. What makes it extra special is\nfollowing this film after all the other solo efforts from each\ncharacter. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all\ndelivered something different. Winter Soldier delivered conspiracy\nthrills. The Iron Man trilogy factored in Tony Stark's complete\ndramatic arc, character flaws and all. The Dark World was pure sci-fi\nfantasy. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that\nresulted is an extra special treat. <br><br>It all works so well and is grounded enough to carry the story and the\naudience through an unbelievable ride. In fact, it doesn't just fit,\nit's an exciting symphony and that dichotomy and difference in\ncharacters and how they interact are what makes this movie truly great.\nIt's why Avengers stands so tall above any other franchise at the\nmoment. Things like Transformers, Fast/Furious, and even Star Wars or\nStar Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all\nangles and even multiple genres all by itself. It delivers depth of\ncharacter with its fun and amazing action sequences. There's a reason\nwhy these movies make as much money as they do. They deliver a lot of\neverything and do so at a high quality.<br><br>Right from the beginning of the movie, where we get the all in one\ntracking shot, through the epic final globe smashing conclusion,\neverything is on go and everything delivers superb intensity and\nspectacle.

Let started with how the movie\nwas started.After the movie started, this was a fight scene already to\nget everyone pumped up for this movie. The fight scene was well made\nand all the character were introduced.I also love the plot twist in\nthis movie because you'll never know want going to happen next.The\nstory is getting more interesting from one second to another.<br><br>Now, let move on to how I thought about this movie. My favorite\ncharacter is Hulk because has incredible power and strength and able to\nsolve any problem by smashing everything.Hulk feels like one of my\nfriends because when he goes mad, he smash everything.My favorite scene\nin the movie is when Hulk buster fights with Hulk.When I saw it in the\ntrailer, I know it's going to be great and when I watched in the movie,\nit's even better.There is also a story about Hawkeye since he didn't\nhave a movie. This movie makes me feel intense because you'll never\nknow when there a fight scene and someone could have die at any moment.\nThere are a few parts that I don't like about this movie.First off,\nthere are too many jokes. They also tell jokes in the middle in the\nfight scene which make it less interesting. Second, Ultron appears out\nof nowhere and he goes destroy everything. Also, how can he have a\nfacial expression since he an AI.Everything else except these two is\ngreat.<br><br>Finally, I think this is a well make movie and I would recommended to\nall of the superhero fans out there.If you like explosion,epic fight\nscene superhero, robot, you are going to love it. I rate this 8/10.\n"},

Although the only really funny part\nwas Checkov dying, he didn't see the chaingun firing, you must be\njoking? Mass produce Ironman 3 bots, now Hulk smash them over and over\nand over and over again, presto the result of the film. Thankfully\nPepper Pots didn't join in. All because these Ultron bots had the most\nannoying Atom (Watchmen) accents ever. The dialogue was boring, the\nplot was totally screwed, the action was utterly repetitive.<br><br>Yawn! Apart from some of the better action sequences, there was nothing\nthere, no nothing at all. The actors mostly looked like they went\nthrough some motions mostly of something else somersault to go out and\nget paid. They just didn't jive.<br><br>The first film was epic, this second film is such a lame comparison.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe main complaint about this film in all of it's negative reviews is\nthat it isn't \"dark enough\". I was actually pleasantly surprised to\nfind out that this movie blended humor and fun with the darker elements\nbecause I was turned off by the teaser trailer. I don't want the new\nMarvel superhero movies to try to be edgier than everyone else. I\nthought the darker and lighter elements blended well in the movie. With\nthe exclusion of Quicksilver I liked the new additions. I didn't\ndislike Quicksilver though, but I did prefer the X-Men version over\nthis one. I thought Ultron was a pretty great villain. He was not as\ngood as Loki or the Ultron marketed in the trailers, but he was still a\ngood enough villain. The movie did seem a bit rushed and Thor's side\nquest was kind of dumb, but over all I was satisfied with this movie.\n"},

The ending of course is literally out of\nthis world as the Avengers have to contend with a falling Sokovia\nplummeting Earth as well as Ultron and his countless robot minions.<br><br>Hawkeye gets some character development introducing the audience to his\nfamily living in a remote cabin in the woods (get it). Banner and Black\nwidow have a few scenes opening up to each other filling, some\nemotional depth of the movie.<br><br>The movie however does have a few plot holes that were left\nunexplained. At the end of Iron Man3 Tony Stark decides to quit being\nIron Man, yet here he is in all his glory. A few jokes could have also\nbeen left out as it desensitized any tension or suspense.<br><br>Joss Whedon does an admirable job in making a consistent summer\nblockbuster. Cool CGI, fun one-liners, good performances and average\nplot is become somewhat of a template that most Hollywood movies seem\nto follow. I feel that Marvel should have tried to do something\ndifferent as I was left wanting something a bit more.

It reminded me of Man of Steel, a lot of wanton\ndestruction in one film which just becomes dull after a while.<br><br>The plot, Tony Stark uses Loki's sceptre to kick-start an artificial\nintelligence peacekeeping programme that he has tried to develop for\nsome time. Even though Bruce Banner warns him several times not to mess\naround with the power of the sceptre, each time Banner then helps\nStark.The end result is the formation of Ultron who decides that it is\nthe human race that needs to be destroyed and kick-start a new earth\nthat would be peaceful.<br><br>So in between the wisecracks including an ill judged Latin gag its Iron\nMan's recklessness that causes the chaos. Captain America is still an\novergrown boy scout, there is a bolt out of the blue growing love\naffair between the Black Widow and Bruce Banner which comes across as\nunconvincing as the scenes where they tried to hide Scarlett\nJohansson's bump as she was pregnant in real life at the time of the\nshooting, hence why she is the bar woman for the night in that party\nscene. Its Hawkeye who is more fleshed out in this film and delivers a\nmore human dimension to the plot.<br><br>Of course along with the main plot we have a whole host of subplots\nthrown into the mix including more superheroes and villains amongst the\nmix. So we have the Falcon dropping by, Quicksilver and the Scarlet\nWitch and the formation of the new Avengers by the end of it.<br><br>The film tries to do too much and looks like a film made by committee\nand lacks the personal vision which elevated Captain America: The\nWinter Soldier last year.\n"},
{"review": "\nin a vacuum, this is a pretty good action movie, but being a sequel to\n\"the avengers\" means it will always invite comparisons to the original\nand be judged at a higher standard. Unfortunately, \"age of ultron\"\ndoesn't live up to it's predecessor. The action and humor is still\nthere. Joss Whedon excels at crafting these fluid elaborate action\nscenes where the camera pans between multiple characters kicking ass in\ntheir own way and then occasional teaming up to take down some bad\nguys. It's pretty impressive to see considering the size of the\nAvengers roster and the extreme differences in each superhero's powers.\nHumor-wise, we have typical Whedon jokes, but I'd argue that there's a\nbit too many going around in the midst of all the fighting this time.\nSome jokes felt forced, with characters spewing one-liners every time\nthey got any screen time during an action scene.<br><br>Plot-wise, the writing is less focused than the first one. There's a\nscene where Thor goes into a cave somewhere, submerges himself in\nwater, and starts having dream-like visions of the future, and this\ndoesn't make much sense or seem necessary. Quicksilver and Scarlet\nWitch are woefully underdeveloped, with a boring backstory and bad\nclich\u00e9d Eastern European accents. With all the details packed into this\nfilm, it seems like Marvel's trying too hard to connect the dots\nbetween all their properties and set things up for the future, and this\ncomes at the expense of the movie as a whole.<br><br>One of the bright spots is James Spader's portrayal of Ultron. Instead\nof being this stereotypical cold, calculated, terminator-like villain,\nhis personality is that of a spoiled, petulant, mischievous child, and\nit works pretty well.\n"},
{"review": "\nI feel people are being unnecessarily harsh with this movie. While it's\nnot perfect, it still has everything a summer blockbuster movies should\nhave, sadly with a little extra baggage.<br><br>The story and setup is simple enough to follow along and has some ideas\nand themes that are fun to think about. It's nothing really deep, but\nit adds some meat whereas another blockbuster franchise, Transformers,\nhas nothing like it. Every action sequence was fun, and they all felt\nas though they belonged and didn't feel too random or out of place. <br><br>Most of the characters are still just as great, and Hawkeye was\ndeveloped even more since he got the short end in the first movie. The\nonly major stumbling blocks are the romance between the Hulk and Black\nWidow, and Thor's side-quest. The former felt unearned and it was\nconfusing since she had more chemistry with other characters. The\nlatter felt like padding. Ultron was actually snide and funny, which is\ndifferent than the solely-menacing villain in the trailers. That's not\na bad thing but it was unexpected and he still was quite menacing. <br><br>The humor was mostly spot on, and I think that helps because with a\ncharacter that looks like the Vision, this film should not take itself\ntoo seriously. There are two running gags that start at the beginning\nand get funnier as the film goes on, both ending with a good pay-off. <br><br>This isn't as good as the first, but it's still well-worth watching.\nThis is what audiences really want when they're only looking for a\nsimple story, engaging characters, fun action and spectacle. It's pure\nescapism and entertainment.<br><br>**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS**<br><br>Another thing that really bugged me was there was a character who was\nmostly introduced in this film, and he dies at the end.

{"review": "\nI liked Age of Ultron overall after I thought about it for a while.\nComing out of the theater, it felt like a disappointment, and I think\nthat's because people hoped it would be better than the first. It's\nnot, but it has some great sequences. I liked the new characters a lot.\nI'm very interested in what Scarlet Witch and The Vision can do in the\nnext movie. I liked the character they created for Ultron, but he never\nreally did anything interesting or memorable. Some aspects of the movie\nthat should have been more clear were things that you had to put\ntogether for yourself, which shouldn't be a bad thing, but in this kind\nof movie, it is. Ultron's motivation, for example, is the main aspect\ndriving the plot, and you really have to work it out of the subtext.\nFor a superhero movie aimed at a wide audience, I don't think that was\neffective. Loki's true purpose only gets a passing mention in the first\nAvengers, but it was also backed up by the first Thor movie. Everything\nin that movie seemed to work; Ultron had me thinking, \"Well, I guess I\ncan see that, if you look at it that way...\" So while it was miles\nabove the average action adventure film, high expectations clouded my\njudgment.\n"},

Probably only Superman 1 and 2 compare to the Marvel films for\nmind bending fun. <br><br>The various Marvel sub-genres, Thor, Ironman, Captain America, are all\nexpertly produced and mounted entertainment, solid and well crafted. <br><br>But Ultron is, well, different. Watched it last night and after the 1st\nviewing in Imax 3D - essential - I was struck by the length of the film\nand the mindless fighting scenes. The lovely Safe House sequence dead\ncenter is a rest from the chaos surrounding the fights with Ultron and\njust about everybody else. <br><br>Film editing is an art, not a science, but I could have cut perhaps 20\nminutes out easily by trimming down the endless battle sequences. After\na while, SOMEBODY has to get hurt and the Avengers get hurt soooooo\nrarely. Natasha is human through and through - never a scratch. Tony\nStark out of armor is just a human too.

It's mind-blowingly awesome. Seriously. In fact, it would\nprobably take multiple viewings just to fully appreciate some of those\nsequences and moments (like when Thor hammer-struck the city into\ndust). It was OMG... so good.<br><br>If there are any flaws to Age of Ultron, I would say it's mostly in the\nsubpar dialogue and over-use of cheesy one-liners.

{"review": "\nThis was... entertaining at least, but Age of Ultron features a lot of\nthe Hollywood toxins that plague several big budget productions today,\nfrom pointless comedic quips that add nothing to the story or\ncharacters, overuse of CGI that isn't the prettiest thing to look at,\nand a story so overloaded that it feels empty compared to what came\nbefore.<br><br>Age of Ultron wasn't Guardians of the Galaxy, certainly wasn't Marvel's\nDaredevil (the Netflix TV show), and didn't have nearly the same level\nof excitement as Captain America: The Winter Soldier let-alone the same\nprecise direction.<br><br>I do love the superhero genre in film, but Age of Ultron has all the\nclich\u00e9s we've come to expect from it and doesn't take nearly as many\nrisks as the first Iron Man film did. There was just no danger, nothing\nthat stood out from what we've already seen in the Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse. <br><br>Entertaining, but not substantial as a standalone film. I'd recommend\ngoing onto Netflix and watching Marvel's Daredevil.\n"},
{"review": "\nFormulaic or not, it's undeniable what cultural impact The Avengers has\nhad on the youngest generation of movie goers. Kids who were born in\nthe Summer of '12 now claim the Avengers to be their favourite thing\n(source: my girlfriend's 3 year old nephew and his Hulk\nimpersonations). I almost envy them for having such a planned web of\nmovies to be nostalgic about in their teens. The closest thing I have\nis the long but more contained Harry Potter franchise, though I do pity\ntheir parents wallets when it comes to the eventual bulky boxsets. As\nthe Marvel Cinematic Universe gets more and more crowded, so do their\nmovies. Avengers: Age of Ultron has little room to breathe and is\nmore-or-less a big stitched-together mess. A fun mess for the most\npart, but one that emits a consistent buzz of CGI, action sequences and\nfan service to the point where it's far too easy to become numb to the\nstakes as it goes along. <br><br>I really enjoyed the first Avengers, by about a million times more than\nany other Marvel movie, but I think the novelty of the group hit its\nlimit there. The most efficient part of Age of Ultron is Robert Downey\nJr's sharp witted one-liners, the best his humour's been yet, and one\nthat will almost definitely go over the heads of the film's young fans.\nI knew the Iron Man series hinged on his charisma, but this film is\nhanging firmly by that rope now. I don't know what they're going to do\nwhen he signs off. Meanwhile, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are very\npoor additions to the clan and while I get the ideas behind Ultron, I\ncould never get behind him to take him or his tried-and-tested plan\nseriously. If Whedon struggles to get enthused about this one, I don't\nsee how I can be either. Easily beats Winter Soldier though. It's like\na broken stained glass art with some shards I liked, some shards\nmissing and some shards unpolished.<br><br>6/10\n"},
{"review": "\nLet's start with the good. 1. Unintentional Taylor Swift easter eggs.\nDialogue feature Captain America saying: \"So we're just supposed to\nSHAKE IT OFF?\" And then \"run and hide...\". And finally, Black Widow\nsays \"Nothing lasts forever\". And then Captain says \"except for TROUBLE\nTROUBLE\". 2. Cool characters like the twins. But weird that they kept\non saying \"enhanced\" instead of \"mutant\". The bad. 1. WHY?! did Black\nWidow like Hulk? Since when?! I thought she and Hawkeye were a thing!\nAnd suddenly Hawkeye is out of the picture with a family? And I can't\nbelieve Black Widow would be so vulnerable about her feelings, or care\nthat she can't have children. She's tough, it's such a 180. 2. No Loki.\nThe villain Ultron was lame and not a threat. He's just a machine. 3.\nLess funny from Iron Man, who seems like a douche. Overall, I feel that\nonly Captain America and Thor acted as expected. It's OK but too long,\ntoo action.\n"},
{"review": "\nIn my opinion, The Avengers (2012) was one of the best movies ever. If\nyou disagree with me, you are an idiot.<br><br>I watched The Avengers (2012) while on a plane and deeply regretted not\nwatching it in a cinema instead, because it was so focking awesome.\nAfter landing, I got a digital copy of it (through entirely legal means\nof course) and watched it about 10 times within a two- week span. I\nALSO proceeded to watch ALL the previous MCU movies, none of which came\nclose to being as awesome as The Avengers, although some (such as the\nvery first Iron Man) were very damn good.<br><br>I vowed that I would pay to watch ALL sequels to The Avengers in a\nproper cinema. I also forecast that the series of Avengers movies would\nbe the best/greatest/awesomest trilogy (or quadrilogy) of all time.<br><br>So imagine my disappointment when, three years later (i.e. today), I\nhad to sit through 2+ hours of an utterly pedestrian superhero movie. I\nfelt like crying when, after random things blew up and rocks flew\naround and they went to \"The New Avengers Facility\", I realized the\nmovie was coming to an end. <br><br>Because you deeply value my opinion, here are my rankings for the 11\nMCU movies released so far (as of May/June 2015):<br><br>#1 Avengers 1 A++ One of the best movies ever #2 Iron Man A+ #3 Captain\nAmerica 2 A #4 Guardians of the Galaxy A #5 Iron Man 2 A (unlike most,\nI actually liked this) #6 Thor 2 A-<br><br>#7-#10 B+ (Run-of-the-mill, predictable superhero movies) The\nIncredible Hulk Thor 1 Captain America 1 Avengers 2<br><br>#11 Iron Man 3 B- Total Schei\u03b2e (compared to most of the other MCU\nmovies). I hated this particularly bad.\n"}
