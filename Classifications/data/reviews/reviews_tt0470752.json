{"review": "\nI rarely do this because there is so much rubbish out there but I'm\ngoing to recommend a movie. Writer Director Alex Garland has done an\namazing job, it's beautifully shot, fantastically lit, intelligently\nwritten, brilliantly cast. the edit is original and brave, as is the\ndirection of the edit, There is nothing superfluous, to the contrary\nit' has a sharp Zen like quality, clearly the application of a\ndisciplined mind.<br><br>The movie is's self is engaging, thoroughly watchable, the characters\nare simple and yet layered with complexity. The film strikes the\nperfect balance of not spoon feeding and not dumbing down but not being\ntoo arty or intellectual just for the sake of it. <br><br>Best seen in a cinema I reckon.\n"},
{"review": "\nEx Machina has a simple plot. Nathan, a reclusive programming genius,\ntreats one of his employees to a week at his remote estate with Ava, an\nenigmatically charming robot who's meant to wow (or seduce) her visitor\ninto believing she has human tendencies. Although this appears to be no\nreal challenge, both Nathan and Caleb, the unlucky employee,\negotistically assume they control the experiment. The rest is a\nforegone conclusion. As much as I like Nathan and his dancing Japanese\nservant, style is no substitute for ideas. Where other films might\nexplore the potential ironies or paradoxes of artificial intelligence,\nEx Machina reduces the human condition to basic animal attraction. When\nnot quoting philosophers or scientists, Caleb is a voyeur and Nathan is\nthe inventor of elaborate sex toys. Ava just happens to be a\nspectacular example.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is the kind of movie I really enjoy when I think about science\nfiction. Movies that make you think if we should continue trying to\nprogress even more. Are we not already smart enough with everything we\nhave? With all our daily gadgets that we can't miss for one second. Do\nwe really need artificial intelligence? Because let's face it, once\nthat will be concrete then we won't do a thing by ourselves anymore. We\nwill send our robots to our job, we will chose and model our life\npartner like we want them to be. The story of Ex Machina might be\nfuturistic but I certainly can imagine it like that in the future. All\nactors were good in their respective roles. For a movie that is filmed\nat the same spot all the time you certainly don't get bored for a\nsecond. Nice science fiction like there should be more of them.\n"},

When it ended I was like \"who wrote this?\nwhat else has he done so far. gotta watch it\"..<br><br>They did so much in this film with such a small budget. In a better\nworld this movie would be celebrated in cinemas worldwide and not left\nfor torrent down-loaders.<br><br>Warm recommendation! :)\n"},

CEO,\nsupposedly genius programmer himself, could not even get to the source\nof his power outages that happen many times every day. A super-smart\nprogrammer confused that he might be a robot himself. An AI that is\noverly concerned with its own sexuality. An AI that's stupid enough to\nget away from the power source - it's been constantly charging its\nbatteries while in the house.

{"review": "\nAlex Garland has done an impressive thing. He's managed to produce a\nbetter Sci-fi film than Sci-Fi giant Ridley Scott's latest attempt, and\nhe's managed to make it popular too!

Besides the\ntopic of AI that will fuel your post-movie conversations for sure, Ex\nMachina is worth watching for its best-in-class actors. Alicia Vikander\nplays the moving Ava with a disarming sensitivity. A star is born! The\nset is also astonishing. I'm curious to know where this closed- door\nthriller was shot. The brief glances at the surrounding nature and\nmountains are breath-taking.

Anyway, I loved\nthis film. Watched it last night on DVD. It has depth and darkness and\nleaves you with something, as great writers and directors can only seen\nto do occasionally. It is very atmospheric, with a great soundtrack,\ngreat performances by each actor. If you like action films, why do you\ngo to see this? Reviews are always available online here.

The\nkey points were communicated without excessive verbal exposition (the\nbane of SF films). I thought the successive revelations of Nathan's\nostensible and true motives were cleverly managed.

Because emotion is a hormonal phenomenon. A neural network\nsoftware or a brain chip like TrueNorth may evaluate things like a\nbrain does, but the lack of hormones renders it emotionless. It may\nemulate emotions like study the brain activity and physical changes\nhappening in the body when a particular emotion is being experienced by\na human and imitate it exactly to look like a human.

{"review": "\nThis movie is very good on many points. I am not going to be specific.\nJust going to point out what I liked about this movie. The story was\nnot just good. It was very original and challenging to a mature mind.\nThe sets were good. Special effects were concentrated on bringing the\n\"android\" to life. I think they were successful. The actors were well\nchosen and I found them believable and I was easily engulfed into the\ndrama of the film. I wanted to follow the story and never felt things\nwere too slow. The acting was good. It must be a challenge for a woman\nto act and have her audience believe she is an android. Yet she still\nappealed to me as a woman. Very good mix and I feel the director did a\ngood job. This movie was not just good. It was different and appealed\nto me more as a drama. But this is a fantasy/science fiction movie.\nJust and outstanding story too boot!\n"},

Very well done movie\nand brings you in to the world of cyborgs, although not like a\nterminator film, the writing, dialogue and acting are all top notch as\nwell as being a little dramatic/suspenseful as the characters are\nchallenging each other.

{"review": "\nI was expecting a lot of this movie and it was a great experience.\nFirstable, the cinematography of this movie was epic, the colors, the\nlights and the different angles and shots. On the other hand, the\nproduction design, you feel the claustrophobic environment of the\nscientific research center. The performance of Alicia Vikander was\nexcellent, she looks like a robot, speaks like a robot, acts like a\nrobot, she was a robot. The other actors, Isaac and Gleseson did a\nripping performance too. Oscar Isaac with a character not very easy to\nplay and when you see the film you can't figure out that is Oscar\nIsaac. Gleeson, on the other hand, did an sterling performance, he was\nable to create an atmosphere inside the movie that makes you live the\nentire film by yourself. Ex Machina is a great film, you may feel\nconfused and thoughtful after watching it. This will be a classic for\nsure and if the academy is fair will be at least nominated in some\ncategories.\n"},

Sadly this movie\nseems to meander at times, slowly without any serious direction\nresulting in a loss of interest. In addition, the movie's focus is on\nthe characters and not so much the science fiction element itself. This\nwould not be horrible if you enjoyed, or found engaging, any of the\ncharacters - but for me that didn't happen.

{"review": "\nFilm-makers have been making 'big' films about artificial intelligence\nfor decades, but few of them had much serious content. Writer/director\nAlex Garland has a history of coming up with implausible overblown\nideas, but 'Ex Machina' avoids these pitfalls. It takes a scaled-down\nlook at the topic in a savvy sober screenplay which is nicely\ncomplemented by the acting, design and direction.<br><br>A young employee of a hugely successful IT company wins the opportunity\nto spend a week with its technocrat CEO at the man's remote estate. On\narrival, he discovers his boss wants him to assess the personality of a\nfemale android, which has been equipped with advanced AI. The resulting\nnarrative is a noir psychological Sci-Fi suspense film, which plays out\nin a claustrophobic modernist house perched above a rushing river in a\npristine forest wilderness.
