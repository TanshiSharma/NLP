{"review": "\nWhy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\nam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\nhas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\nand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\nand friendship and redemption. <br><br>The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\nKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\nwatched them.<br><br>I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\nand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\nas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\npatrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\nout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the\ntime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\nexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\nthings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\nsaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\nit gets better with every showing.<br><br>No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\neach other.<br><br>The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\nI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't\nreally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\nor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\nbest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\nbut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\ntakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.\nShawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what\nis so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even\nthough the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite\ndifferent, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are\ngoing through.<br><br>It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont\ndidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love\nthis film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie\ndidn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not\nsee this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your\nfriends recommendation about the movie sway you.<br><br>Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will\nfinally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand\nwhy this is my all time favorite movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe reason I became a member of this database is because I finally \r\nfound a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There \r\nis nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element \r\ncomes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. \r\n\r\nI believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that \r\npeople have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of \r\nAndy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. \r\n\r\nHowever, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find \r\nmeaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a\r\ndifferent path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.\r\n\r\nWho is your Andy Dufresne?\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about\nto tell you why.<br><br>Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of\nmurdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947\nand\nreceives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely\nfriendship with \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get\nthings.\nAndy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens\nbecause he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt\nofficials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....<br><br>I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of\nrespect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have\nnever seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g.\nSeven).\nThe twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it\nwasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The\ncinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the\nsheer magnitude of this daunting prison.<br><br>But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all\nother\nfilms, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story\nand the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant,\nthought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment\non this film, I think he might say: \"Get busy watching, or get busy dying.\"\nTake his advice.<br><br>Thoroughly recommended.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nOne of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story\nabout hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with\neveryone\ngiving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie,\nbut Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison\nguard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an\nelderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at\nleast one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very\nsurprising \"twist\" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If\nyou have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll\nwant to see this one more than once.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nOne of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story\nabout hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a\nmovie. It tells a lesson about life.\nThose are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's\nalso a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, \nfrom rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are\nmajestic in their performances. Each learns from the other.\nTheir relationship is strong and you feel that from the first\nmoment they make contact with one another. There is also a\nwonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.<br><br>He shines when it is his time to go back into the world,\nonly\nto find that the world grew up so fast he never even got\na chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the\nscreen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion\nthat people \"will\" be talking about in \n50 or 100 years.  \n"},
{"review": "\nMisery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now\nyou can add Shawshank to that list.<br><br>This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the\nfirst to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on\nthe IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure\nit could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the\nfilm because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that\nwhat I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote\nit.<br><br>King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the\nCastle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his\nbest adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was\nbrilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned\nMisery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes\nonto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to\nunderstand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. <br><br>What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it\nconveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim\nRobbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he\nnever loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man\nagain. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane,\nbut it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a\ndifferent feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and\nI don't know if there will again.<br><br>I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been\nsaid, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best\npicture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or\nShawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will\nbe appreciated for years to come.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies\nI have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better\nthan it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen\nKing is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul\nand moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it\nin his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is\nso top-rate it's almost scary.<br><br>Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the\nmurder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\"\nRedding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to\nescape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as\nWarden Norton, and there are great\nperformances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows\n(late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who\nsuffers under the iron will of Norton.<br><br>If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be\ndisappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my\nTop 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and\nheart. 10/10\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and\ndeep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built\non from their and that foundation is hope.<br><br>Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal.\nTim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was\ninspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just\nmade me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted\nof murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but\nyet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\"\nRedding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest\nperformance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep\nregret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain\naway is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with\nAndy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy\nalso becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also\ngave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole\nbut in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". <br><br>The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this\nmovie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great\ncinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but\nnot in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares\nmentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. <br><br>Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is\noverrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies\never. It has everything you could possibly want.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the\nhuman spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his\nwife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to\nbring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story\nis interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting\nand chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it\ntouches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with\na sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was\nthe first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption\nis even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean,\nnor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times,\nhorrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all.\nRedemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily\nredemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is\nredemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be\ncalled a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be.\n\n"},
{"review": "\nI still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it\nagain last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery\ngot thicker.

The voice over alone seems to belong\nto a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what\nwe're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the\nfilm because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives.\nThe most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey.\nCredible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without\nasking too many questions.

It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and\nthis has the appearance of what they need at just the right\ntime.<br><br>Is a film great because it merely fulfills?

{"review": "\nThe Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a\nperson in prison, it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and\ncarries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the\nmovie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to\ngo out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay\nhome. Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV\njust by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At\nfirst I was skeptic, I admit that. But oh God, at the end of it I was\nscreaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM! It gave me so much emotions\nand so much hope, I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe\nthat a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about\nmy life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great\nstory of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The\nShawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite -\ngives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to\nfreedom. Morgan Freeman's voice is just another advantage that makes\nthe movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins' act is just beyond\nperfection! I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or\njust bad about something, I watch the movie. It has become my personal\nshrink, making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never\nimagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000\nyears!\n"},

The \"weaknesses\" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail\nmovie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of\na movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible\nwith the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption\nis loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.<br><br>In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for\nanything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing,\nand my first 10/10, I think I'll let it slide this time.\n"},

{"review": "\nI really liked this movie, which I just recently saw for the first\ntime, strange indeed since it is more than 10 years old. It reminded\nme, naturally I would say, to Papillon, the 70's McQueen/Hoffman\nclassic.<br><br>I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely\nrecommend it to everybody. But compared to Papillon? There are so many\nsimilarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came\nout of the blue. Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared\nwith Papillon. And Papillon is simply even better. It is emotionally\nmuch more touching, and when even Freeman's great performance doesn't\nmatch Hoffman's, there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen\n- in that role I mean! Tim gave a great performance but his role didn't\ngive him the chance that Steve had.<br><br>Anyway, a joy to watch. But please watch the \"original\" too, it's not\nold-fashioned at all! I can only guess, but I think the huge\ndifferential of 9.1 for SR and 7.9 for Papillon is because most young\npeople have never seen Papillon.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nA film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont.  .  .  Who? \n Starring Tim Robbins.  .  .  Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck?  I\n admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to\n see this movie.  Now the only questions I have to ask are:  Why didn't\n EVERYBODY go to see this movie?  and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the\n Oscar?  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan. \n Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his\n horror opus'.  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and,\n Mr Darabont take a bow.  Very rarely are you left with a large smile and\n warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera\n slowly panned back from the beach.  .  .  Perfect.\n"},

But in this case, the movie is so much better, I like\nthe end more than in the book.\nWatch the movie, it is great.\n"},
{"review": "\nTim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who\nis sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan\nFreeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen\nKing's short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" (in the\nfilm version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the\nultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with\nthe usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few\nhomosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole.\nHowever, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well\nserved by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out\namazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure\nfantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it\nneeds, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but\nengrossing and satisfying, \"Shawshank\" was not a big hit at the\nbox-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from\n****\n"},
{"review": "\nI simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite\nsimply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of\nKing's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and\nvoted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in\nthis film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the\nend, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really\nnothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and\nthe director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the\naudience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story\nwas written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept\nwriting... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the\ndoor and wrestle the pen from him yelling \"for the love of all that is\nholy, stop writing!\" And I thank that faceless man for doing that,\nbecause it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes\nlong, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on\nand on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but\nwith excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film\nexcept for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really\nthink of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems\nfrom my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone\nwho is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to\nfans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're\nnot a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable.\n5/10\n"},

The acting is great and\nit tells a good story. <br><br>Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste,\nbut its far from a bad film. <br><br>On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was\nnominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in\nlove with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several\nhundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.<br><br>This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its\na great one.\n"},

Complexity is something completely exiled from this\nstory.<br><br>The director, Frank Durabont, offers nothing new in his aesthetic choices --\nSHAWSHANK is stock Hollywood filmmaking, especially of the Spielbergian\nvariety ala THE COLOR PURPLE and AMISTAD.  The soundtrack is overpowering in\nits efforts to imbue the story with \"heartwrenching emotion.\"  The\ncinematography is fine in a sort-of standard-issue, \"seen it before\"\nway.<br><br>Which begs the question:  Is there anything truly *exceptional* about THE\nSHAWSHANK REDEMPTION?  Heck yeah -- Morgan Freeman proves, once again, that\nhe is not only a wonderful actor but also one of the most endearing,\npowerful presences in cinema.  Tim Robbins is fine, along with all of the\nconvicts.<br><br>But overall, I didn't mistake THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION for anything\nparticularly new, remarkable, exciting -- in other words, as anything worthy\nof fanatical enthusiasm.

I bought the film and put off watching it for a couple\nweeks, not overly anticipating watching it, but finally decided to\nwatch it when I was bored.

Now, every time I watch a movie I can't help but\nthink \"It can't beat Shawshank.\" Some people say that this movie is\noverrated, but that's wrong. Shawshank is an actual work of art, to be\ncompared with works of DaVinci and Picasso. When people say this movie\nmakes them cry, they don't mean to say it's so sad, but that they\ndidn't know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen.\nI believe that if everybody see's only one movie during their life, it\nshould be this one. See it now. After that, IMDb will seem like a whole\nnew website because every film will seem like a different movie. It is,\nby the very definition of the word magnificent.\n"},
{"review": "\nthe Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all\nschools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between\nfriends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor\nhe lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be\nlike without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is\na movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh\ntimes. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it.\nI first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued\nby the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values\nwere the storyline instead of violence and havoc, this is a amazing\nfilm which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the\nsetting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the\nstunning facilities astound me i'am finding it hard to put in to words\nhow much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest\nfilm's ever made in my time and i love it.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt has a formula that gives you this kick; Darn what a good movie! But\nI need to say this, sometimes it happens.. So WHY do people love this\nmovie and rate it high, when, or WHY isn't the \"smart\" people declare\nit like a a peace of art? Or do they?! Still I think it's darn\ngood...but I bet the producer(s) didn't expect that!<br><br>Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a\ntypical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it's a\ntypical 90' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind\nand now, we NEED this! Love me as I am.. says the storyline, in my head\nanyway. And I do, yes I do!\n"},
{"review": "\nIm not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this\nfilm is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of\nthe other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is\nwithout any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is\ntremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper\nmeaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is\nabout the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is\nyour greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his\ngreat escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is\nalways meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds\nwhen Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends\nwith, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the\noutside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds\nthat he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later\nin the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is\nfinally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same\nsituation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself\ndidn't commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he\ndoes have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend\nagain and to \"give him a handshake\". And as the movie comes to a\nmarvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.<br><br>Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I\nwill continue to keep watching it again and again and again.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe 'Shawshank Redemption' undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated\nmovie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders\nto our lives and makes something impossible to possible.<br><br>Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely\nconvicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies\nin the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he\ninfluences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman\nin the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever\ncome across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King,\nis equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The\ndialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring.\nThe background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan\nFreeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red\nrespectively.<br><br>Didn't watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as\npossible. Can't miss a movie like this....\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I\nreally can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the\nwriting, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with\nstrength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think\nabout even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an\nevil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge\nto insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of\ntime goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really\nputs you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those\nbars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure\nhorror of it all.<br><br>4 stars out of 4\n"},
{"review": "\nI haven't seen too many movies that I would rate a 10, but I had no\nproblems giving this one top score.<br><br>Movie-making seems to be like golf; for a truly excellent game, ALL the\nelements must come together. Everyone involved must have perfect\n\"form\". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when\nhe put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan\nFreeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this\nmovie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of\nthe supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly\nbelievable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).<br><br>The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It\nmust have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and\nend. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects\nwrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said,\n\"This is just right!\" Buy this one for your home collection because\nyou'll definitely want to see it again.\n"},
{"review": "\nI totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the\ndirector portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's\npretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of\nAndy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be\nthe greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the\nset. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of\ncharacters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of\nShawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's\ntoo good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought\ntears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all\nthanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the\nfirst place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And\nkudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nOne of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day\nclassic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and\nfind solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a\nStephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this\nfilm than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim\nRobbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan\nFreeman as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close\nfriend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the\nWarden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed\nfeelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who\nis sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film\nis easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I\ndefinitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy\nAwards including (Best Picture, Best Actor \u0096 Morgan Freeman, Best\nAdapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original\nScore, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from\nthe film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have\nbeen nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the\nperformance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen i rented the movie, i was doubtful, whether to rent it or not.\nThen i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure,\nit wud be worthy watching this; and worthy it was. The fascinating\nperformance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and\neverything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way\nthey felt. This movie doesn't have any dirty romance or impossible\nactions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when\nthere is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you\ntalking about it even many days after watching. I won't say anymore,\nthe rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie\n"},
{"review": "\nAt the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank\nRedemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you\nthat this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict\nrating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if\nyou haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at\nleast once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of\nendurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning\nscore that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it\ncould make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank\nreally is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by\ndevotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness.\n"},
{"review": "\nTo be honest, I enjoy reading a good novel more than watching a film.\nYou usually get far more character development than in a movie (e.g.\nPuzo's The Godfather).<br><br>But not with Shawshank. This is the closest thing film has to a perfect\nstory. The characters, pacing, plot, monologues and every other element\ncontribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending. <br><br>Brook's suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears,\nand if you watch just one film in your life - let it be this. Not a\nfilm which others have tried to mimic for a good box office, e.g. LOTR:\nThe Return of the King, The Godfather, but an original, stand-alone\nfilm that, in my opinion, will never be surpassed in quality\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is one of the best movies ever made. Not really because it's\nreally really good but because everyone likes it! I can't think of\nanyone who doesn't like this movies, young, old, male, female and over\nthe entire globe! Good Work! It's a story about a man (Tim Burton) who\nis cent to jail for a crime he didn't commit (the murder of his wife\nand lover). In jail he meets good and bad people like always. One of\nthem is Morgan Freeman. He is the guy who can get you anything you\nwant. Because Tim Burton is innocent and a very intelligent guy he is\ndesperately trying to find a way out of this jail. The relationship\nbetween Tim Burton and the rest of his jail-mates can be touching but\nalso horrible and with some violence. This is a great \"feelgood\" movie\nabout hope, love, hate and freedom!\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like?\nAfter watching it i thought it was a brilliant film,fantastically acted\nwith greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. Very\nrealistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. At\nthe end it made me cry and thought about life. Every time i watch it\nthe film brings a tear to my eye. Fantastic film and worth\nwatching,it's really realistic film and another one of stephen king's\ngreat stories, a story of hope and many people who have watched will\nsay the same thing - if you haven't seen this film already then watch\nit, it is brilliant, just brilliant!!<br><br>be prepared to be moved, it's such a breathtaking journey for the whole\ntwo hours. A truly lovely magical film, my favourite of all time\nfantastic\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman gives\nan\nunbelievable performance in this work. The direction of it is exquisite\n(and gives much to Tim Robbins character, I know he is a good actor, but\nthe\ndirection gives so much more to him).  The soundrack is unparalleled and\nthe\nstory is exquisite (thanks to Stephen King).  I have seen many greats,\nCitizen Kane, The Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse\nNow....etc. This movie is fantastic, and the fact it didnt' win (or even\nget\nnominated) for an Oscar is the reason I don't pay attention to the Oscars\nanymore. This movie is fantastic, and an artistic triumph. I have no\nrespect\nfor the Academy for ignoring this flick.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nPeople look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the\noccasional negative review that pops up for this movie.  Some viewers are\nlooking for gritty realism in everything on the screen.  Others are action\njunkies.  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce\nmoviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest\nshot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real\nchance that they simply will not \"get\" this film, and that's too bad -- they\nare missing out on a classic.<br><br>At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter\nhow pretty, and can reach down and touch people.  That is where Shawshank\nsucceeds so brilliantly.  It is not the fastest moving movie, not the\nedgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray.  But this movie\nabsolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as\nwell as any movie has ever done.  And THAT is filmmaking at its finest.  Not\na game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits\nhave rolled.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nIt deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit,\nalthough some may not have the patience for the slowness. But the whole\npremise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm,\nemotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know\nTim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy,\nsnobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's\ngenial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's \"a man who knows how to\nget things.\" I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of\nits two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes\ntheir friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational,\nfar-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it\ndoesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is\nflawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's\npretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the\nfilm's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things\never committed to film. Get it in either format. \n"},

{"review": "\nI'd never heard of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" when I tuned in to it\nabout 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around\n1997 or so.<br><br>It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the\nmusical score, the final scene. Amazing.<br><br>I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with\nAlta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I\nfound out that they had.

Between\nBrooks suffering, Red's hatred of hope, and Andy's response to his\nfinal isolation, I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy\nliving or get busy dying.
