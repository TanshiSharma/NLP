{"review": "\n\nTo think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director\nSteven Spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world\nthe greatest war film ever made.<br><br>Though it's true that this is not the type of movie you want to sit down\nwith the family and eat popcorn, the emotional drive of the picture, the\nstory's poignant messages, and the fantastic acting of the cast draws you\ninto a world that is both dangerous and unpredictable.<br><br>Spielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a\nparticipant in the movie and not just a viewer. This is Tom Hanks' best\nmovie he ever did. Forget his performances in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump\n(though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the\nrole of Capt. John Miller, a leader who must act strong in front of his\nmen,\nbut must also hide his emotions from them.  It would have been\nwell-deserved\nif he won again.<br><br>I give this movie my highest recommendation. Saving Private Ryan is a movie\nthat makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty, though\nthey are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in war, can put you\nin\njeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe\nin.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt gives a million reason why no one should go to war and one very powerful reason to go to war. It is a soul numbing realistic depiction of what \nour grandfathers, fathers, uncles, brothers and sons have faced in humanities darkest moments. Not just in WWII but in any war. No one can see this movies \nwithout being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the \naudience in the middle of the battle. <br><br>Steven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than \nappalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every \ntime the question of war comes up. This movie would not stop future wars but I would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined. I say this \nas a US Marine.\n"},

{"review": "\n\n  I was hoping for an accurate war film for a change (take\n a look at the Battle of the Bulge for a really bad example).\nWhat Spielberg shows us in his Omaha Beach scenes makes me wonder<br><br>which Omaha Beach assault he is trying to portray. Those who\nknow\nlittle about the battle (that's almost everyone who's in the\ntheater)\nprobably now have the idea that every other soldier who landed on the beach\nbefore noon was either blown to smithereens or badly wounded.<br><br>Believe me, the 1st and 29th Divisions would have been annihilated if it<br><br>were as bad as it's portrayed and would never have been able to scale the\ncliffs and rout the enemy by early afternoon, which they did. I wonder, for\nexample, how wide most viewers think Omaha beach actually was. In the film\nit looks about a couple hundred yards. It was, in actuality, almost ten\nmiles wide. The timing was also inaccurate - Hanks goes up the cliffs at\nwhat appears to be 8AM. Nobody made it before 11AM.\n   Another historical error is the implication that the events at\nOmaha\nwere similar to those on the other four assualt beaches (Juno,\nSword,\nGold and Utah). That's totally incorrect. Utah Beach, for example, the other\nUS assault beach, took about a dozen casualties - many of those due to\naccidents during the landing rather than from enemy action.\n   But the worst part of the movie was the completely idiotic\nscript.\nHere we have the US Army sending a squad(a squad!!!) to march straight thru\nthe entire German 7th Army (something two Divisions, with total air\nsuperiority couldn't do for weeks), waltz around an area of 300 square\nmiles, and expect to find a guy named Ryan. If they wanted to do any of this\nnonsense, the Army would have sent them in on the gliders that flew into the\narea the very next morning. \"Gliders, what gliders\"?  said Spielberg. That's\nwhat happens when you have a scriptwriter who doesn't\nknow very much about his subject.  A stupid, stupid film. What a\nwaste\nof $100M or so. \n"},
{"review": "\n\nVisually, the best WW2 movie.\nIn other ways, far from the best.\nThe movie is loaded with errors and falls into demonizing\nthe German soldier and praising the American.\nA few examples, far from the reality the combat scenes show the Germans\nacting like cattle without ANY strategy at all\nthey just run and shout,\none funny part is the behavior of the German tankers,\nthey drive in a ruined village in a VERY narrow street,\nlike\nthey have never heard of ambush!\n-One starts to think if the script writer has ever heard of<br><br>the capabilities of the German panzer crews,\nSS-Captain Michael Wittmann attacked and destroyed 48\narmored fighting vehicles alone in a single action!\nThe most absurd part is the -\"Macgyver/Rambo scene\"-when Capt.

{"review": "\n\nThe opening of the film is visually stunning and really hits you in the\nface. But when Tom Hanks and his buddies have made it through the first\nenemy line this film turns in to a Hollywood war movie in which good and bad\nare clearly divided between the  Americans (according to Spielberg, there\nwere only white American teenagers and Tom Hanks participating in D-Day) and\nthe Germans. The way in which he portays the reallity of battle also is not\nvery objective(as history should be portrayed) whenever an American soldier\ngets shot, the audience is manipulated in feeling his pain and when a German\nsoldier gets shot the audience is made to feel the excitement of victory. We\nare also made to belief that the German soldiers really liked it there\nkilling Americans, while on the other hand the Americans are righteous\nbelievers in God and really have a lot of problems when they have to kill\nsome one.\nWell Spielberg marketed this all as an important history lesson he had to\ntell, well he really must hate Germans depicting them in a way as he does in\nSaving Private Ryan\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWar movies have often been one of Steven Spielberg' specialities. This one\nachieved a huge public and critic success. What drew the attention in this\nwar movie are fight sequences. They're extremely violent and bloody. We have\nbeen rarely so far in the reality of fights. It's difficult to forget the\nfirst half an hour of the movie during the Normandy landings. Spielberg's\nsober and showy directing increases the phenomenon.<br><br>However, you must admit it, the movie is based on a trite, plain even\nconventional story. You could use this last word to describe the famous Ryan\nsoldier. Indeed, he's told that he can go home because all his brothers have\nbeen killed.

{"review": "\n\nVery good film - the landing sequence at the start was phenomenal. The\nacting was of a uniformly high standard. A couple of things spoiled the film\na bit for me.<br><br>The Germans are treated as 'Nazis', even when most Wermacht soldiers were\njust serving their country like everybody else. Also they seemed to be\ntargets that got mown down in droves and were generally portrayed as less\nthan human. I thought that went out in cinema a few years after the war\nended.<br><br>Finally the only mention of the other allies is one disparaging comment\nabout Montgomery's failure in front of Caen. Firstly he was facing most of\nthe German armour that was dug into strongpoints, and secondly on D-Day and\nfor a period after the British and Canadian troops out numbered the\nAmericans. I wouldn't normally bother but Americans seem to view these films\nas historically accurate representations.<br><br>With the release of U571 this trend is getting even worse. The capture of\nthe Enigma machine was carried out by a British destroyer crew - before\nAmerica even entered the war!<br><br>The new Colditz movie is following this path. There were very few American\nPOW's held there, and none of those escaped by the war's end.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis is one of the single worst films I have ever seen.  Spielberg\nwas, once again, intoxicated by his own sense of patriotic\nsplendour.\nThe first major flaw in this film struck me the first time I saw it.

This aspect of\nthe film is a disgrace to Germans and more importantly to the\nbrain-washed americans.\nFinally, I would just like to point out the fact that this was not a\nwar to rescue individual men in order to preserve their family line.\nThis film makes a mockery of WWII by completely misrepresenting\nit.  The only aspect that was accurately portrayed was the violence,\nwhich sadly enough drew many people to the film.\nTwo thumbs down!<br><br>\n"},

There`s very little depth to the story which seems at odds\nwith the anti war visuals.<br><br>I will defend the film slightly from the allegation of pro American bias.\nIt`s an American film , made by Americans , with American money for a\nprimarily American public. For a more subjective view on the Normandy\nlandings see THE LONGEST DAY , or better still read the book. But the\ncomment on Monty was uncalled for , Bernard Law Montgomery spent 4 years\non\nthe western front ( 1914-18 ) he was disgusted by the slaughter he saw\nthere\nand made needless casualties his main concern.

{"review": "\n\nThe more I think about this film and read differing reviews about it the\nmore I feel it wasn't meant for me. I'm a Finn, not American. I don't know\nif Spielberg meant this film as a last hoorah for the G.I.:s, but to me\nthat\nis what he made. All right the film does have something to tell for\neveryone: in the insane theatre of war one should try to do the right\nthing,\nhave courage to do it, that your actions have consequences, war as a whole\ncreates nothing but bad feelings and probably something else too but\nnothing\nthat has not been told earlier.<br><br>And I suppose that isn't so bad, I mean there have certainly been worse\nfilms. But what does bother me is that Spielberg set out to do a film\nabout\nwhat war is really like and to me, he failed.

Even if one would skip\nall\nthe omissions and strange things about the film (in the landing scene no\nnaval artillery support, no air force support and the illogical German\ntactics in the final battlescenes) to me the main plot is a strange\ncuriosity that only serves to illustrate that the average soldier wasn't\nthat interesting or important. Apparently with some links to reality the\nmain plot remains distant and odd to me.<br><br>With Oscar, block-buster, critically acclaimed material as ww2 with all\nthe\ngore how could Spielberg go wrong? First of all the acting. Well I could\nnot\nstop wishing there would have been some lesser known actors used, maybe\neven\namateurs. A lot has been made out of the cinematography and yes, it is\ngood.\nAlthough to me it is not so effective when there is apparently too much\nmoney to make a film and then the camera work tries to make it look more\nrealistic.

Why in the end, did Miller, Ryan, and Sarge have know problem\nmowing down the by passing Germans, then survive the same gauntlet, with\nalmost twenty German's firing at them?<br><br>Another thing, is I couldn't help but notice how far people flew through the\nair whenever hit by a mortar, or stepped on a land mine\u0085or hit by a\ngrenade\u0085so on, so on.

The brutal\nrealism and gore are hard to watch at times but is necessary to fully\nshow the horrors of war.<br><br>All I can say about this movie is don't expect your favorite characters\nto make it out alive. I was pretty upset originally when my two\nfavorite characters in the movie died, but that just adds to the\nrealism of the movie. People died. Your friends died. Heroes died. War\nis Hell, and full of heroic sacrifices. This movie is a must see for\nany American, though I believe foreigners should enjoy this movie as\nwell. An excellent 10/10 from me.\n"},
{"review": "\nConsidered by many to be a fantastic film, I feel I must have missed\nsomething. This film is certainly a good film by any standards. (The\ncamera work is well done, backdrops are excellent and the opening scene\non the beaches of Normandy is one of the most memorable in cinema\nhistory) But the film does suffer from a couple of failings.<br><br>Firstly, it is strongly and unapologetically patriotic. The film beings\nand ends with the American flag, and the in fact, the Americans appear\nto be the only people in the film. The only appearances from other\nnationalities are the Germans, and the only character seen is a\nback-stabbing monster. In contrast, the American soldiers are all rough\ndiamonds, and each death scene for an American character is a\ntear-jerking moment of sadness.<br><br>Secondly, the plot. After the initial scene, the plot becomes somewhat\nsilly, going increasingly downhill until the surviving half dozen\ncharacters end the movie fighting a battalion of soldiers and a squad\nof tanks. I really don't understand how anyone can watch the end of\nthis film with any seriousness.<br><br>In conclusion, I'd say that the only way this movie deserves the high\nregard it seems to have is if after watching the opening half hour, the\nmovie was switched off. None the less, I would recommend viewing this\nfilm, as its qualities do outshine the flaws.\n"},

Tom Hanks commands as strong a performance as we\ncan expect him to, and the rest of the cast also does quite well.<br><br>I guess that if the movie has any problems, it's in the characters\nthemselves.

To many, life at home was a carefully guarded\ntreasure that served as a very personal and private link to sanity and\nhope. If you haven't seen this film, make it a point to do so.

I found a number of scenes to be pure Spielberg fantasy.\nThe scene in which Hanks doesn't provide the full name of the 'Ryan' he\nis searching for, which results in Hanks delivering the wrong\ninformation to the wrong 'Ryan', is hard to swallow. The scene with\nMatt Damon protesting when told he is being taken off the front lines\nis also hard to believe.<br><br>The scene where Oppem (or whatever his name was) protests against\nshooting the POW is absurd. No way that would have ever happened. Some\nof the other unlikely aspects of the film: Tom Sizemore throws his .45\ncaliber pistol at the German; four soldiers pull the pins on their\ngrenades and drop them in the tank turret, yet none of them detonate.\nThe scene at the end when Tom Hanks starts firing at the tank with his\n.45. In real life, he would have been dead by then after being shot in\nthe back with what amounts to a high powered rifle. <br><br>The scenes after the Germans bring their 20 mm. cannon into action also\ndidn't get very far past the GI's first encounter with the fearsome\nweapon. After it annihilates about six or seven GIs from one short\nvolley, one wonders why the Germans didn't make quick work of the rest\nof the GIs after that.<br><br>The dialogue was also a bit too pristine for my tastes. In reality, GIs\ncurse up a storm.

How can a movie that uses cookie cutter\nNazis, that treats German soldiers as simply \"the enemy,\" even make the\nclaim that it is a realistic depiction of war? Somehow, only the Americans\nin Saving Private Ryan have a human component, the Germans conveniently\nhaving lost theirs. Compare this with the Japanese soldiers shown in The\nThin Red Line and you'll see that Saving Private Ryan's praise for being an\nunderstanding and sensitive picture of that war is little more than a\njoke.<br><br>Now, I'm not saying i do not understand why the Germans are depicted as so\nflat. If I were Jewish and had family members who had been in concentration\ncamps, I probably wouldn't be able to depict Germans in anything but a\ndehumanized capacity either.

The movie follows soldiers\nin the 75th ranger regiment as they land on the beaches of Normandy.\n(best scene in the movie). Tom Hanks is then given an assignment to\nrescue Matt Damon and bring him home because all of his other brothers\nwere killed in combat.

Do we deserve it? Only a row of\nmarbled crosses will be able to answer... Why then not a 10? Simple...\nI have seen German War graveyards... where each cross is shared by 3\npersons per side. With people from early 50's to those that barely\nreached 18. War is hell for all... not only for Private Ryan.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is (in my opinion) Spielberg's best, and when it comes to\nwar movies, a strong contender for the best war movie ever. The\nstoryline makes you question the mission and the sacrifice of lives in\nwar throughout the whole movie. The story is touching and made me angry\nat the same time. The great cinematography and equally great special\neffects emerge you in the story. The cast is great, and works great as\nan ensemble. Typical for a Spielberg movie, John Williams made the\nmusic, and didn't disappoint. It brings war and all its terrors to\nscreen in a more emerging way than any other movie (e.g. the opening D-\nDay scene). An absolute must see movie, especially for war movie fans.\n"},
{"review": "\nBest War movie out there. Although Band of Brothers is better but that\nisn't a movie but I highly recommended that to anyone. This is\nHollywood best film that portrays war to date! This movie doesn't show\nglory of war. <br><br>I'm a huge WW2 buff and my Grandfather(on my mother's side) served with\n691st Tank Destroyer Battalion during the European campaign with the\nU.S. I also had family member, who was a U.S Marine that died on the\nU.S.S California during the Attack on Pearl Harbor.<br><br>In the end this a well made film fore every film lover because it is an\nexcellent war drama that puts you in the war with really develop\ncharacters who are not portrayed as heroes.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Saving Private Ryan\" is the best WW2 film out there. It starts off\nwith a memorable 25 minute opening sequence which is arguably the best\nscene in a Spielberg movie. It is highly realistic for its time and\nit's tense from beginning to end. At the end of the sequence, it shows\nyou a dead soldier from the \"Ryan\" family. Later we find out that 3 of\nthe 4 members of his family died and Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and\na group of 7 soldiers are sent to bring the remaining brother back to\nhis family before he dies as well. With an unforgettable story, the\nplot is quite moving even just thinking about it. The movie was also\nexpertly shot and acted. Every action scene is realistic as it is\nbloody. After soldiers are killed off, it makes the soldiers question\nif the mission is worth it and it often creates conflict with them. The\nfinal battle has a big buildup and carries on for just the right\nlength.The ending is tragic and it gets me every time but its emotional\nresonance sticks with the viewer after watching it. This is one of the\nbest films of the 90's due to its impact on the viewer.\n"},
{"review": "\nOne of the most important movies of the 1990s and a triumph for Steven\nSpielberg, helping to keep alive the story of the Greatest Generation\nand remind us of the sacrifice of war.<br><br>Spielberg takes time to introduce us to a small band of soldiers,\ngetting to see the end of World War 2 through their eyes. The movie\nfollows the last days of the European war, as the American forces push\ninto France against a Nazi army that is not yet ready to give up. To\nsay much more would be giving away major plot developments, but the\nplot features several major surprises and gripping battle scenes.<br><br>\"Saving Private Ryan\" also features an incredible cast, including Tom\nHanks, Matt Damon, and many cameo appearances from Nathan Fillion, Ted\nDanson and others.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film is lauded as one of the greatest films of all time and I do\nbelieve this film is fantastic, but I believe that it is not a ten out\nof ten film for a few reasons that I will explain. This film is based\nin ww2 and the start of the film is the invasion of Normandy better\nknown as d-day. After the battle a group of 8 soldiers are sent on an\nimportant mission to rescue a private who's other brothers have been\nkilled recently. Now tom thanks is now established as one of the best\nactors ever and it is films like this that is why. His performance as\nthe commander felt real it felt like he knew his duty but he was\nrelatable to us because of the way he acted in certain situations. This\nman is a superstar and he truly encapsulates everything that this\ncommander has to go through. The supporting cast all also do a really\ngood job, this film is not a character study film but everything the\ncharacters go through make you feel for them and empathise with the\ncharacters. Now the story is where I actually think this film slightly\nmisses, I do believe it plays up the war part of the story well and\nalso the social issues that are explored should be applauded and are\nvery good. However, towards the middle of this film it just felt like\n30-40 mins could have been cut out because nothing relevant to the\nstory happens and it could have been done in a better way. The script\nis really good with the dialogue feeling natural among war buddies and\nit also makes you feel like you are in battle with them. The style is\ngreat I applaud Spielberg for making this film more realistic with the\nbrutality because that was how war really was. A lot of directors try\nto pc it but not a top director and it adds to the realistic gritty\nfeeling that this film possesses. This is a heavy film and it can be\nhard to watch sometimes but it is a fantastic film that truly delivers\non its message and does indeed deserve a lot of praise.\n"},
{"review": "\nGripping, horrific first-person experiences in the thick of World War\nII, as you're already, no doubt, keenly aware. It's held up\nexceptionally well over time, most likely due to the great lengths\ntaken by Spielberg and company to stamp it down in a specific era and\nremain steadfastly historical. The Normandy beach landing that opens\nthe action is still as powerful and haunting as ever, an effects\nshowcase like none other that puts us right down in the middle of hell\nitself. I couldn't help but pontificate about the futility of ground\nwarfare here, faced with row after row of doe-eyed teenagers,\nunceremoniously mowed down before taking so much as a single step on\nenemy territory. Which is part of its message, no doubt - though that's\nsomewhat countered by the tales of bravado, camaraderie and character\nthat sprawl out over the next two hours. A richly rounded war story, it\nenjoys a mess of acting performances even stronger than the work of the\neffects team. Tom Hanks is at the top of the mountain as Captain\nMiller, a demanding role that he owns from moment one. Supporting faces\npop out of the woodwork at every corner; most of us remember Vin Diesel\nand Adam Goldberg in early roles, but quick shots from Paul Giamatti,\nTed Danson, Bryan Cranston and more left my jaw agape. How did I miss\nspotting these guys the last time? A true epic, profound and moving,\nwith plenty of action but just as much character-building and adventure\nalso in the mix. One of Spielberg's - and Hanks's - best.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie maybe is not in first ten or twenty movies on Top 250 list,\nbut it's worth to be watched like many best rated movies. It's just my\nopinion... Great drama, very realistic war scenes, it is enough for me\nto be one of my best watched movies ever! I watched this movie much\ntime ago, and I think that all time later there is no movie which leave\nsuch strong impression on me like Saving Private Ryan. Movie won five\nOscars, absolutely justified, and #34 on Top 250 - all that is\nsufficient recommendation to be watched. Tom Hanks play the role like\nalways - brilliant! Also, and complete film crew deserve all the\npraise... World War 2 thematic with all these realistic photages\ninsight you in all misery and suffering of this war.\n"},
{"review": "\nGreetings from Lithuania.<br><br>I can not really say anything about \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998) that\nwas not said before countless of times. I'm just going to praise it one\nmore time. <br><br>\"Saving Private Ryan\" is a masterpiece of movie-making, it's true.\nAlmost no other war film can't take you to the place like this picture\ndoes. \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\" are the best war\nmovies ever. Very different, yet very similar on the note of anti-war\nideas. Now back to \"Saving Private Ryan\". The opening scene is ...\nwell, you all know, it's a jaw dropping experience, and i mean,\nexperience - for a 20 min you can partly feel what is war and how it\nwas to a soldiers on that day. This scene alone is a excruciating\nmasterpiece. The film settles then in to a journey through hell\npicture, it still remains unforgettable. No matter how many times you\nare watching \"Saving Private Ryan\", it grabs you from the opening scene\nand does not let go this the very last image. As i don't think there\nare people who never saw this film, i can just say, watch it again.\nIt'a a film to remember, and to learn. It'a a masterpiece on all\nlevels.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is my favorite war movie. I like it except the final battle. Our\ntroops totally got ripped to shreds. Cpl Upham, he is a coward. I know\nhe isn't used to this combat, but he is essential to all the other\ntroops. He is carrying the extra ammo. He was too scared to help that\nprivate fight that enemy troop and was to scared to give the troops\nmore ammo to the MG. If I was him, I would've been scared too, but I\nwould've done it anyway for my brothers. Also, in the beginning, when\nthey opened the door to get off the landing craft, you are already\ndead. I think that's crazy. Plus, when they confronted the real Private\nRyan, he refused to go home. Isn't that a rule in which if all your\nbrothers die, you are supposed to go home?\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was an immense gathering of suspenseful, action-based,\ndramatized scenes. I saw this film when it came out but I was just a\nkid. I saw it again and again for years to come only to like it more\nevery time. The rawness and originality in the art of the battle scenes\nis just amazing; the gore, the sadness, the cinematography, it's all\nthere. I'm not even a big fan of Spielberg's work and aside from\nSchindler's List, this is the only other film that I love by Spielberg.\nI give it a 9 for its long driven awesome plot with WELL developed\ncharacters(main, supportive, etc.) and gruesome battle scenes. The use\nof foreign languages when needed was also there. An overall well\nwritten work of art.\n"},
{"review": "\nI've never been in the military, let alone been in any type of real\ncombat situation. Despite this, I feel like I have a semi-realistic\nidea of what it would be like; and that is absolutely horrible. I can't\nsee any good that a soldier can take away from combat and this film\ndoes a remarkable job of depicting the ugly truths of this, in a way\nthat almost anyone over the age of 12 can appreciate. If you are\nattempting to shield your child from the ugly truths of life on this\nearth and specifically American history and war, then don't show them\nthis film. When watching this film, I can actually feel the pain of the\nprotagonist as he fights his way towards his objective. Obviously, this\npain is nowhere near the level of what the soldier whom this film was\nbased off of and all others directly involved actually felt, but I feel\nit is as close as you can get without being involved. This film\nincorporates fantastic writing, CGI, cinematography, set-building,\nacting and basically every other level of production to create the most\nrealistic World War II Normandy depiction I have ever seen. The only\nreason I would not rate this movie any higher is because that would\nmake it a 10 and I believe perfection is impossible in the art of film\nproduction, but it's about as close as it gets without 3D or any other\nrealism enhancing technologies. Watch this film and gain a better\nunderstanding of what many of America's young men were experiencing at\nthe time of the second world war and also how they were mentally and\nphysically effected from the horrific events which ensued.\n"},

Following the infamous D-Day\ninvasion Captain Miller and his men must traverse the dangerous Nazi\ninfested countryside to find Private James Ryan, so that he may return\nhome among the chaos that is war.<br><br>Not only one of the finest war movies ever crafted, but one of the\nfinest human dramas ever filmed. Through the backdrop of World War II,\nSpielberg delivers us right into the action, suspense and heart felt\ndrama. Filmed in a guerrilla style like approach helps to enhance the\nrealism of this film. Perfectly acted by Hanks and company, one will\nfind themselves immersed and truly caring for these characters as the\nfilm plays on. Said to have made veterans weep during its release and\nduring its intense first thirty mins, as its depiction of the events of\nD-Day upon the beaches of Normandy to be the most realistic and finest\never captured on film. The world of war torn Europe and the brave men\nwho fought there is brought to life with not only the masterful\ndirection of Spielberg, but with the haunting and heroic score by John\nWilliams.
