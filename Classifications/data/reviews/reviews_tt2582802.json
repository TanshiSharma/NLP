{"review": "\nInspiring, intense, reverent, Damien Chazelle's jazz-infused drama is\nan incredibly complex character study that has Miles Teller and J.K.\nSimmons at the top of their game in this brilliant effort. Whilst I was\nfixated by 'Birdman' and found 'Boyhood' a generally entertaining\nwatch, 'Whiplash' is by far the most riveting and sensational drama I\nhave viewed from 2014. J.K. Simmons stars as antihero Terence Fletcher,\na character we look at as the opportunity of Andrew's success, but also\nwe hate for his brutal portrayal. His performance is flawless and\nbreathless, a truly resonant achievement. The final drum solo ends the\nfilm on a high note and keep its audience lingering on the edge of\ntheir seats, it is powerful, it is intense, it is a near-masterpiece!\n"},
{"review": "\nWhiplash is low budget film making at its finest, and surely promises\nbig things from rookie director/writer Damien Chazelle. Seeing this\nfilm in theaters was the first time this year that I have completely\nenraptured (granted, I have not seen all of the top films that have\ncome out so far). Also, I am a succor for quality films about\nmusicians, and Whiplash ranks in my all time favorites in that genre.\nThe tension did not let up from the very first scene, especially as\nsoon as the incredible J.K. Simmons enters. Simmons, along with Miles\nTeller (who's Project X days are now long behind him) have some of the\nbest on screen chemistry I've seen. They're connected; one cannot act\nwithout it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on\nthis relationship, and the simplicity definitely services the film. I\nhope people will go and see it and vote with their pocketbooks for\nexcellent low budget films.\n"},

I have learned and practiced 2\ninstruments here in Europe and can only say when I watch how this\nShaffer character treats musicians like football players, this would\nnever work. In such an environment any musician would get so tense and\nso full of fear to fail, he would certainly do exactly that. This is\nnot how musicality and technique is teached. Never. Music is not\nsports. What Shaffer does may create a robot band that plays precise\nlike a computer. But the music that comes out that way will sound\nalike. People in music are sensitive. Teaching is a process of mutual\nunderstanding, respecting and elevating between teacher and student.<br><br>Further, a good drum technique with speed is not achieved by such\ntensioned convulsion, it needs the right finger and hand control and\nswing.<br><br>The acting is certainly admirable but the cuts are sometimes worse then\njust distracting.\n"},

Also, Jazz is far\nless rigorous and robotic than this movie would have you believe. Jazz\n(and Blues) have always been about self-expression - play, spontaneity,\ncolour, contrast &amp; emotion. Lots of great jazz players are self- taught\nand never even went to music school (see Django Reinhardt).

{"review": "\nI laughed my head off at every scene in this movie! It was hilarious!\nThe whole thing reminded me of an SCTV skit. I expected John Candy or\nMartin Short to come out at any second throughout the entire movie. Now\nI know why musicians and music students are making fun of this movie\nall over the US. I was a HS music teacher for more than 15 years, and a\nprofessional musician my entire life, and I've never seen a funnier\nmovie about music in my entire life. The only one that came close to\nthis was Ken Russell's version of \"Tommy\", but Whiplash took itself\nmuch more seriously than Tommy did. People are getting more and more\nbrainless about music every day (especially jazz), so it didn't\nsurprise me that many people thought this was a good movie. I guess I'm\nnot as angry about how bad this piece of garbage was compared to the\nother people that gave it a bad review, because I waited for it to come\nout on DVD, and didn't waste a lot of money seeing it in a theater.\nThis would make a great feature on Mystery Science Theater 3000 it's so\nbad!\n"},
{"review": "\nHard to rate this film because there's so much to like - the\nperformances, the unusual story-line, and the fact that it's about\njazz. Still what stays with me is what I liked the least about the\nmovie - the fact that Fletcher's torturous and reprehensible methods\nseem to be validated in the end. I really wished the kid would have\nsucceeded in spite of Fletcher and showed him that his methods only\ncause irreversible damage and sometimes even death. Abuse is not the\nway to make talent (artistic or otherwise) blossom - McCartney,\nSpielberg, Federer, Bach, Evert, Picasso, Da Vinci - there are\ncountless examples of genius without without abuse. Maybe jazz is\ndifferent? I doubt it.\n"},
{"review": "\nI admired the cinematography and the acting, and at the start, thought\nthis would be a great film. But then the bullying and violence\nstarted... The first episode was shocking but gripping, and I wanted to\nfind out where the film was leading. It turned out to be leading up a\nblind alley. The sadistic teacher was a ridiculous stereotype, the\nbleeding hands were just plain unbelievable, and all the other members\nof the band just sat around watching but not reacting to the appalling\nabuse. This method of 'teaching' wouldn't work; there is a big\ndifference between pushing students to achieve more and violent\nbullying. And the idea that such violence and aggression could lead to\nstudents producing better music of all things, would be laughable if it\nwasn't so sick. <br><br>I was tempted to walk out but watched till the end, hoping for some\nkind of balance or note of realism.

The drumming was poor and the drummer no Phil\nCollins. The general public in the US must be so gung-ho to accept this\ndrivel.... if all you have to be is a loud mouth abusive jerk to get an\nOscar then I give up.

{"review": "\nAfter the hype all around, I went in to watch this movie with a lot of\nexpectations. Especially because I haven't seen a movie on drumming, at\nleast not a drummer as the protagonist. I have to admit, I am a little\ndisappointed.<br><br>Drumming is an art. One needs finesse to be a drummer. Here, in the\nmovie, it seems all about 'speed': playing fast tempos. Double time and\ntriple time. To the extent blood oozes out of your body. Is that the\ndefinition of good music? Haven't the makers of the film heard of\n'rests' in music charts. What not to play and when not to play is more\npowerful than what you indeed play.<br><br>And why is it that the Conductor Mr.Fletcher has his eyes set only on\nthe drummer. Not once did we see him interact with the other musicians\nof the ensemble.<br><br>With all that filth and anger from the Conductor, one really wonders if\nany good music would ever flow out from that band? It reminded me of\nthe great movie 'An officer and a gentleman'. The Commanding Trainer in\nthe movie was arrogant and ruthless for a good reason. But not so in\n'Whiplash'.\n"},

Of\ncourse, he couldn't have won Best Actor, but he'd be a shoo-in for Best\nSupporting Actor, which he won in spades.<br><br>Towards the middle and continuing to the end, the plot became\nridiculous. Getting smacked by an oncoming truck where your car flips\nover, and then running to make your concert? Physically attacking your\nteacher?

It's like going to a jazz concert,\nespecially the finale performance at the end. For the plot itself,\nhowever, I did not like it at all. The teacher is very abusive, and\ndies everything he could to stir up rivalry and hatred among his\nstudents. The worst thing is that the film gives him time to justify\nhis abuse. Abuse is not right, and the film allows abusers to give\ntwisted reasons to justify something wrong. That really angers me.\nCoupled with the fact that his students keep on receiving the abuse, it\nevoked a lot of anger in me.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat a wooden film. As a viewer, you cannot really get to know any of\nthese characters. Nothing great comes from an abusive teacher. Hitting\nstudent in the face, really? No. It was unclear what JK Simmons'\ncharacter really was after. Was it perfection? Is the only way to\nachieve perfection by humiliating students with verbal and physical\nabuse? The drumming was excellent. I'm a musician and I've never heard\nof students bleeding all over their drums. It's ridiculous. The only\nthing JK Simmons' character cared about was tempo. Talk about\nunidimensional. He crucified students only if they couldn't determine\nhis tempo after a few beats. What about dynamics? What about\ninteracting with the band? The script was superficial and lacking.\nPeople probably like this film because Simmons was an interesting\ncharacter and the drumming was interesting. You'd think such a\nbrilliant teacher would be a more impressive jazz pianist - another\nboring scene.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film reminded me of my high school band instructor who brutalized\na number of students. Some had to be hospitalized and developed\nsymptoms that debilitated them for life. One of the trombone players\nlost his front teeth when the instructor threw a metal chair at him,\ncomplaining that he wasn't in tune. Later, he told us he was only\nkidding, and that if the trombonist didn't know he wasn't in tune then\nhe deserved it. Nobody ever thought they were out of tune again because\nthey didn't want their teeth knocked out. One day he threw a cymbal at\none of the alto sax players and cut into his thigh, severing an artery.\nHe was later hospitalized and still has a limp. The instructor said he\ndid it because he heard Charlie Parker was named \"Bird\" because he had\na cymbal thrown at him, which makes no sense to me but what do you\nexpect from a psychotic band instructor?

{"review": "\nWhiplash.<br><br>While definitely being a movie that hid in the shadows for quite a\nwhile, Whiplash is an excellent film that grabs hold of your attention\nand doesn't let go until you've left the theater thirsty for more! JK\nSimmons performance is incredible as he portrays a bully that is too\nbrilliant for his own well-being, while Miles Teller portrays an\nup-and-coming jazz drummer that doesn't see his own potential until his\nanger forces it out. Both are great actors that do this film justice\nand give the audience an exhilarating roller coaster ride of emotions.\nThere are few movies that inspire me to follow in the characters\nfootsteps, but surprisingly after this film I had wished that I could\nplay in such a way as Miles Teller performed.. Nevertheless, this movie\nis a must see whether you have an interest in music or not. 10/10\n"},

I was very impressed with Miles\nTeller too. He first came to my attention in the film Rabbit Hole. An\nexcellent young contemporary actor.<br><br>I would recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in music and\nenjoys films with a good dose of gritty realism.

I kinda regret it now...<br><br>Pro's: Teller and Simmons really did a \"GOOD JOB\" on playing their\nparts, the music (when played in longer sequences) was well-formed, the\ncamera team did an awesome job in capturing the very intense sequences.<br><br>Con's: the amount of swearing....SO unrealistic, WHO talks like that?\nSimmon's Flatcher was SOOOO over the top, WHAT school even pays such a\nteacher!? Also, almost NO plot, two side characters (Teller's\nalmost-gf, his dad) that were absolutely unnecessary to both character\ndevelopment and plot. Additionally, Fletcher seemed like a total\npsychopath with severe schizophrenia to me who even got what he wanted\nin the end by being the biggest dick.<br><br>My Verdict: I had A lot of wtaf-moments, was entertained by the intense\ndrum playing and Miles's acting but I absolutely don't understand the\noverall hype and a rating of 8,5 on IMDb. I wouldn't watch it again.\n"},

{"review": "\n'Whiplash' is the story of two men. One is a young music conservatory\nstudent determined to be as good as his idol, Buddy Rich, on drums.

He\ncurses, cajoles, intimidates and physically assaults his students,\nbuffered by the philosophy that if he does not, they will never achieve\ngreatness.

For me, the only plothole was the fact that Fletcher's violence\ncame as a surprise. In every school there is a teacher who is fearsome\nand that earns them a reputation. Fletcher's 'methods' would have been\nthe talk of the campus - for Andrew to finally gain entry to that\nclassroom having heard nothing of Fletcher's violence and vitriol was a\nbeat that badly deflated the narrative.

{"review": "\nThis is one of the best movie in 2014. i've seen. The movie is\nunexpected,uptight and looking in one breath.Great acting by\nJ.K.Simmons, he deservedly won Oscar. On the other side is Miles Teller\nwho show us again how he can become a great actor if he continue to\nwork in this way. Great reference to the story of Charlie Parker, i\nlove that guy too. I recommend this movie for all movie maniacs like\nme, and others who understand what's the quality, and for music lovers.\nWhiplash and Caravan are wonderful compositions, love them too. That's\nanother deservedly won Oscar. Soun mixing is awesome. If you ever dream\nto be the best this movie gave the great inspiration for that, and that\nmeans you can't avoid this movie. Really magnificent drama for 21st\ncentury.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is one of the best films I've seen in a very long time. I did not\nexpect to enjoy it, since I went into it without an appreciation for\nJazz music or how passionate musicians can be. However, Andrew's\njourney was both emotional and psychological, and I was very intrigued\nby how his relationship with Fletcher formed. By the time the film had\nended, I had developed an interest in the Jazz music scene and I had so\nmuch more appreciation for the intensity of performance art and the\nwork that goes into it. I see the pressure that is put on musicians and\nother artists to be perfect, and that even though music is supposed to\nbe a means of expression, sometimes there is no room for error.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhiplash 2014 is a great movie that shows the story of how just the\nright push was needed to reach greatness. This film is an emotional\nroller-coaster performed by an amazing cast. I've read many reviews on\nthis film and agree with a lot of the good and bad reviews for their\nwell made points on what took place in the film; but in all reality\neveryone needs that push to go above and beyond.<br><br>I loved this movie for it's great story line and script, I loved it for\nit's coverage on the points of \"Just how far are you willing to go for\nwhat you want to achieve?\"; this story takes it to the edge. The actors\nperformances in Whiplash were beautifully performed, you could really\nrelate and follow the characters well. All and all this movie is\nperfect and I cannot wait to have it in our personal collection of\nmovies.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhiplash. As someone who's in orchestra and plays sports, this movie is\nlike an overkill supercut of my scariest moments. Although some things\nin this movie you might not get as well if you don't play an\ninstrument, the intensity is still incredible. I've never had a movie\nwhere I've been sweating the entire film, and shoot, the drum solo at\nthe end is surely deserving of a 10 flat.

{"review": "\nTotally engrossing from frame one! Whiplash grabs you by the throat and\ndoesn't let go until the very end. And we are talking about a movie\nfocused on playing the drums. No murder plots, explosions, sex scenes,\netc... simply a tight, well-told story. Fast cuts help move the plot\nalong and it never drags. Surprises and twists make this a phenomenal\nmovie that forces you to go back and analyze everything that happened.\nThe music is great. I think that is really important because the sound\nbecomes a character that helps tell the story. The greatest part is\nthis movie is not a niche movie, it's not limited to \"band geeks\". I'd\nsay it is identifiable to anyone who has worked in any way to be the\nbest at something. Whiplash tells the story of a man who wants to be\nthe best and shows the cost and torture he will endure to seek that\ngoal. The language is vulgar, but even this serves a purpose; is our\nteacher abusive or tough with good intentions?\n"},
{"review": "\nI was recommended the film by a close friend who is a professional\nBlues player...I rolled my eyes as he talked about it, I thought it\nwould just be a promo for his lifestyle.<br><br>I've never been more wrong.<br><br>The movie is full of real world worries and troubles, especially in the\ncases where one pursues passion rather than the dollar. <br><br>The movie give you a whole new appreciation for Jazz and the (not so)\ndying art of live band.<br><br>The characters are fantastic. But what really sets this movie apart\nfrom the others, is that it dosen't care about the 'everything turning\nout just right' that other movies constantly barrage us with. But that\ndosen't mean it ends badly. There are little tones and scenes that\nanyone who has ever thought about giving it all up can relate to.\nWhether it be work or passion, you can feel it.<br><br>Give it a go, I'm glad I did.<br><br>* if you're still not sure, look up the trailer, there's a scene\nbetween Fletcher (the teacher/conductor) and the drummer (protagonist).\nIt sums up the feeling of the film.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe pain. The heart. The struggle. The challenge. The intensity.<br><br>All of those words describe Whiplash at it's core.

I apologize if this review is short, but I'm speechless after\nviewing this movie, and that is a definite good thing.<br><br>Miles Teller came with his A game and J.K. Simmons came with... I don't\nknow, but it was something more than an A game because it is now one of\nmy personal favorite performances in any movie to date. Just, simply\nput, incredible. From the story structure, to the direction, to the\nacting and even to the subtlety, this movie has got it and then some.<br><br>Honestly, there is probably a million other things I could say about\nWhiplash, but the most important thing is this...

{"review": "\nHaving decided to watch this on a whim, it turned out to be a fantastic\nway to spend just under two hours. I often found myself surprised at\nthe amount of tension and anticipation that was created from a story\nthat was essentially about drumming. It doesn't take a musical\nbackground to tap into the sheer passion that all characters exhibit\nthroughout the whole film. The chemistry between the teacher-student\nduo of Teller and Simmons was incredible and I found both characters\nsurprisingly insightful, with great depth and complexity. In saying\nthat, all of the characters seemed to have some level that it was\npossible to understand, even the parents and girlfriend. It had my\nattention right from the start and it was definitely the best movie\nI've seen in a very long time.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis was a great movie and it totally shocked me. I was like OK maybe\nit will be alright because everyone was saying how great it was and\nwhen I watched it I was shocked. The intensity and the drama was great.\nThe acting was awesome in this movie J.K Simmons is great in everything\nhe does from Oz to the State Farm commercials. The ending was awesome.\nI was excited and intrigued the entire movie it never became dull. I\nsay this or the imitation game should of won best picture. How the hell\ndid bird man beat this movie out that movie was mediocre at best this\nmovie was great. I highly recommend it especially if you play jazz band\nyourself. This is a truly great movie and I was totally shocked how\ngood it was.\n"},
{"review": "\nTo say the least, Whiplash is definitely one of my personal favorites.\nAs a jazz drummer myself, this movie brings the extreme into play and\nit does a very good job doing so. Needless to say, Miles Teller did an\namazing job playing the role of Andrew, a jazz drummer in the school's\ntop orchestra. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) made sure to push the most out\nof his students and his unfortunate downfall led him to the end of the\nmovie. In this, Andrew &amp; Fletcher work more or less together to create\nan amazing drum solo that brings this movie out and about to top off\nthe cake that this movie was. Truly an incredible show.<br><br>10/10 - Amazing to See.\n"},
{"review": "\nClean the blood off my drum set - brilliant. Don't go past 'Go' do not\ncollect $200 just watch and appreciate. Just don't... whatever you do\ndon't clean the blood off my drum set. Mostly the worst part of this\nmovie is trying to get past the angry angst of a perfectionist with a\ntemper. This review does not employ tactics that require extraordinary\ntalents to appreciate verbosity so I say again clean the blood off my\ndrum kit. If you hated your teacher in grade 4, 3, 7. Well you will\nhate the teacher in this movie. The point is no matter how you hated\nhim/her did you come out the other end better off anyway? Only you can\nanswer that.

{"review": "\nwatched this movie 5 minutes ago and nothing but good things can i say\nabout Simmons acting, the writing, and direction of the film. This film\nhonestly made me a fan of teller and i don't think anybody else could\nhave played the role better because he really captures that \"i can do\nit\" attitude that keeps you locked into the film. The film really does\nhave this build to it that is almost too brilliant and the\npersonalities show within the actors so very well that it inspires you\nto really examine yourself and your goals and think \"what drives me?\"\nand \"what is my purpose?\". To be honest i chose this film out of random\nand didn't expect much but now it is at the top of my 2015 movies list.\nEvery once in a while you find a movie that is truly great.\n"},

{"review": "\nWhiplash is an incredible piece of work that gets better every time I\nwatch it. Not only does it have amazing performances by both JK Simmons\nand Miles Teller, but the script is incredibly well written and the\nmovie itself is entertaining as hell. Intense is a word that doesn't\neven cut it, this movie had me on my toes almost every minute of it. It\nis also very inspiring: NO spoilers but there's a scene where Simmons'\ncharacter is talking to Neiman in a bar, that scene and the chemistry\nof the two on screen is just breathtaking. Great job by everyone that\ntook part in the movie. There are also some shots of the city and of\nbleeding hands that actually really help emphasize the mood and current\nsituation in the film. In the end, Whiplash is an amazing film with\noutstanding performances.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is, in a word, phenomenal. The actors do an amazing job to\nbring the emotions to life. I felt rage one moment, and sadness the\nnext. Culminated by a sense of pure awe. The relationship between\ncharacters rides a line between pure hatred and admiration. One of the\nmost fantastic and breathtaking movies in years. I could re-watch this\nmovie a dozen times and still be utterly blown away. This film is an\nabsolute must see for anyone who is a fan of high strung, emotional\nfilms, or really just a movie lover in general. A roller coaster of\nemotions with a main character you can never stop cheering for.Quite an\nexperience, and one I would highly recommend to anyone who asked.\n"},
{"review": "\nDamien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' (2014) left me suspended in a void of\ntension and suspense throughout the entirety of the film. This was\nthanks to the intelligent construction and development of Andrew, an\naspiring drum student (Miles Teller) and Fletcher (J. K. Simmons, who\ntook the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best performance by an\nactor in a supporting role), his demanding and overbearing mentor.<br><br>To merely call this film a film would be a mistake. Once the curtains\nclosed, I was left thinking about this masterpiece and the impact it\nhad on me emotionally. When a film can have this impact, transcending\nthe medium of mere visual entertainment to enter the realms of\nemotional enlightenment, that is something special. You know how an\nItalian chef kisses his fingers and says something in Italian that\ntranslates to \"A Masterpiece\" after tasting their own dish? That's how\nI feel about this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nThere has been a lot reviews and comments on the musical and artistic\nintegrity of the film that I am not qualified to comment on. I can only\ntake it for its face value and go from there as I am not a musician or\na jazz expert.<br><br>This movie has a very simplistic plot and story to tell but the acting,\ndirection and camera work was excellent and really drew me into the\nmovie with superb undertones and mood. Plot wise it's a story about a\nboy with a dream and what he does to achieve that dream with possibly\nno understanding or is possibly being mislead into believing what is\nnecessary to obtain that dream. Truth is probably somewhere in-between.<br><br>The acting is great. The scenes between Andrew and Nicole I felt were\nstiff but the ones between Andrew and Fletcher more than made up for it\nwith raw intensity and tension. I highly recommend this film.\n"},
{"review": "\nthe plot less 'plot' (Spoilers I guess): A psychotic music instructor\nscreams at his student calling him a FAGGOT throwing things at him to\nplay faster and faster (not better mind you) eventually makes the kid\nso nervous he gets in an accident, then the kid plays a corny mid-tempo\njazz number the end. <br><br>There ya go. That's the film. Unreal that this is getting such\nattention, even nominated for an Academy Award. Just goes to show how\nvisceral elements such as cinematography and over-the-top acting can\ntrick people into thinking something more is going on than actually is. <br><br>Final Note: Practice makes the master, having an escaped lunatic\nscreaming in your ear while practicing drums will only prolong your\nattempt to get into 'the zone'.\n"},

It is refreshingly original to walk through a characters\nexperiences of hate and disdain, only to arrive at the same feeling of\nvalidation and respect at the end of the film, making Whiplash a truly\ncathartic experience. rightfully referred to as a thriller because it\ndraws on the excitement of the mundane modern life and puts the\naudience through an emotional roller-coaster that is heightened by the\nuse of sound and lighting that creates this visually aesthetic\nmasterpiece.\n"},
