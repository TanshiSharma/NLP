We\ndon't get much time to get to know the characters; most of their lines\nare designed mainly to give us information rather than developing their\nindividual personalities. We are left with archetypes: the Loudmouth\nTexan, the Humble Mailman, the Brash Adventurer, the Careful Tour\nGuide, the Taciturn Journalist. And then there's the annoying Keira\nKnightly, on hand with her squeaky mouse voice and her runny nose, to\nmake sure everyone in the audience has a good cry.<br><br>I wish the movie had been more about Rob Hall--his hubris and his\nheroism is really the heart and soul of this story.

Sure , it's a stock disaster movie but\nbecause of the nature of the true story behind it , you feel more\nconnected. The special affects are amazing and the performances from\nJason Clarke and Keira Knightley are great too. I watched this in 3D\nbut ended up taking the glasses off because it was so annoyingly dark\nso i recommend watching it in 2D instead. It's a staggering statistic\nthat 1 in 4 people who attempt to get get to the summit of Everest ,\ndies.

{"review": "\nHaving read John Krakauer's account of the doomed Everest climb in his\nbook \"Into Thin Air\" I was anticipating a much more dramatic film with\na gripping script. The wonderful ensemble of actors didn't have much to\nwork with. The film is monotone with no edge-of-seat moments -- given\nthe life-or-death extreme setting. And not much of a dramatic\nsoundtrack either. The film has no cadence at all and just comes off as\na flat docudrama. The only highly emotional moment is when a dying Rob\nHall makes a final call to his wife in New Zealand. <br><br>I am especially disappointed that a compelling part of Krakauer's\nnarrative is almost completely left out. If there is one pivotal\nanti-hero in this story it is the NY socialite Sandy Pittman Hill.\nShe's accused of causing many of the crucial delays to the other\nclients' ascent. Without these delays the climbers likely would have\nlikely gotten back to base camp before the storm came. The film shows\none of these critical delays in the absence of rope lines being fixed\nto the summit. But the film never bothers to explain why this happened.\nIn reality Pittman's distraction of the Sherpa responsible for\ninstalling rope lines is to blame \u0096 at least according to Krakauer. <br><br>This would have made for high drama, but the filmmakers inexplicably\nshow her character in just a few brief shots. One wonders if they were\nthreatened with a libel suit by Pittman, or simply co-opted by her\nwhen, I assume, they interviewed her for background.<br><br>The blend of special effect and cinematography is excellent, and it's\nnot to be missed in 3D. But the story suffers from lack of oxygen.\n"},
{"review": "\nBased on real life events in 1996, this dramatic thriller tells the\nstory of Kiwi mountain-climber Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) as he leads a\ngroup of mountaineering enthusiasts on an expedition to the peak of Mt.\nEverest. Kicking off with Hall and his team boarding a plane to Nepal,\nthere's very little backstory provided for any of the numerous players\nbeing followed, with the focus squarely on their physically demanding\njourney ahead. And here's the rub: the film homes in so intently on the\nclimb itself, with gorgeous cinematography and tense, cleverly designed\nset pieces, that it doesn't take the time to actually make us care for\nthose in this life-threatening situation. Additional groundwork from\nthe onset getting to know the eclectic group of adventurers better\ncould have upped the ante even more, adding extra heft in the second\nhalf when things don't go according to plan. Yet there's no denying\nIcelandic director Baltasar Kormakur (Contraband, 2 Guns) presents the\naction and generates thrills with impressive craftsmanship, aided by\nseamless CGI and Salvatore Totino's Oscar-worthy photography. It's one\nof those rare motion pictures where the employment of 3D genuinely\nintensifies the experience too, lending depth and height to the\nextraordinary environment that is Mt. Everest. Kormakur also lands a\ncast to die for \u0096 including Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, John Hawkes, Josh\nBrolin, Keira Knightely, Robin Wright and Emily Watson \u0096 but wastes\nmost of them, especially the women, in slight roles with no meat on the\nbones. Everest is a solid cinematic outing with just enough excitement\nand tension to compensate for the frustratingly underdeveloped\ncharacters.\n"},

{"review": "\nI read the book \"Into Thin Air\" when it came out and loved it. It is\none of my favorites. I also like documentaries and docudramas. This\nfilm could have been a solid 7 or 8, but sadly is a 4,, at best. This\nis because it seemed inaccurate and agenda driven- it was as though\nthey could not show a woman in a bad light.<br><br>The movie is about two teams who are into the commercial venture of\ntaking climbers to the top of Mt. Everest, People routinely die trying\nto make the summit, so the fact that some rich people with pseudo\nexpert climbing abilities pay somebody to take them to the top is\ndangerous, and difficult to respect. Great shots of the mountain, and\nof Nepal. There is also a compelling story behind the tragedy, i.e. a\nhideous storm coming in making it difficult, or impossible , to make it\ndown alive. The problem is not so much that the movie is inaccurate ,\nthe problem is the liberties seem so agenda driven. <br><br>SPOILER- In the movie they don't just soft peddle the fact that\nsocialite Sandy Pittman had to be short roped up by an exhausted\nShirpa, they don't mention it AT ALL. The short roping was partially,\npossibly mainly , responsible for the disaster, since said Shirpa\nwasted his energy on ONE person. Thats what I got from the book at\nleast, but maybe thats just me. News Flash to film makers- when you\nmutate the story , people notice. instead they blame it some Texas\ndoctor, who delays them and acts like a jerk. It was as though they\nwere afraid to show a woman in a bad light.\n"},

Take Scott for example,\nbeing a guide, he must have been to the top more than once. What's the\npoint of wasting your life just to be up there again? Rob being an\nexperienced guide should know better than to allow a weak climber\nalready low on oxygen to make summit way PAST the turnaround time! and\nit didn't take much effort to persuade him either.

It's amazing to\nwatch people using ladder to pass over a crevasse, as Beck says, '' yes\ni'm scary, i know i can die but i didn't pay to die like i was in\nWalmart''<br><br>at the end you can't blame Rob Hall, he died trying to make every\ncustomers happy.. against all safety like Doug the Postman, what is he\ndoing here? none of them meet the requirement to be there, even Beck\nwho was training 6/7 days is a miracle, the man is alive but shouldn't.<br><br>i loved the movie because of the Everest's beauty, the cast who\ndelivered, and most importantly the story which was, for me,\nincredible. the survivors can't be proud of this adventure but really\nbe happy to be alive. it's a must see\n"},

With\nall due respect, many of the people that died in this tragedy made the\nwrong decisions, an it cost them dearly. Many decisions were selfish in\nmy opinion. Many did this because of their ego or wanting to prove\nsomething to themselves or their families etc. When the journalist\nasked why people want to reach the summit, none of the answers were\nreally convincing to me.<br><br>What I liked about this film is obviously the cinematography and some\nsolid acting.

In the real world\nthat's known as DOA. In the Hollywood world the leader cries out \"is\neveryone OK?\" In the Hollywood world, Not A Scratch. \"We're fine\" they\nall say and resume the climb.

It was\nentertaining to watch however I'm perplexed as to why someone would\npurposefully risk their lives to put a flag or keepsake on top of a\nmountain only to have it corroded by weather just because \"...it's\n(Everest) there.\" Although Fisher &amp; Hall seemed to be great guys I\ndidn't have a lot of sympathy for the clients who did not seem like\nthey had adequate experience as climbers. Also if I had the State of\nMind that induced me to Summit Everest, I'm definitely turning around\nonce I see a Frozen Dead Body! The Journalist guy was weak.

{"review": "\nThis was a great movie. Fantastic cinematography, solidly directed and\ngreat performances. Empathy for characters who spend a small fortune to\ngo up a mountain with the understanding that they could be killed and\nfor that eventuality to be realized is difficult to achieve. Even the\nscript is self aware of that and in one scene the characters ask what\nthe appeal is. But do we need this justification?, the extremity of\nmountaineering, its toll to the human body and ultimately the human\nspirit is drama enough. To that end Everest beautifully charts the\nbeauty and horror of mountaineering as well as its impact to powerless\nonlookers. This would have been easier to make as a documentary but\nbravo to the filmmakers for scripting and acting this piece out. A\ngreat technical achievement. The performances are great too, Jason\nClarke is knock out. Josh Brolin was great too putting in a very honed\nin nuanced performance. However the usually brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal\nplays it too cartoonish and his performance was just that believable.\nBut thats a very minor negative, I strongly recommend you view this\nmovie on the largest screen you can fine.\n"},

The first\npart about climbing the mountain is so so boring, that we almost fell\nasleep watching it. The rest of the movie is sort of OK ish... But its\nstill a B grade movie, wrapped in a A movie shell.<br><br>This one the worst and boring, not interesting movies I have ever seen,\nand I have seen some bad movies...

{"review": "\nBeing kiwi I didn't know much about Rob Hall - Kiwi mountaineering\nlegend - as I was only 19 when he passed away and for what ever reason\nI didn't pay much attention back then to the events on Everest. .

Naturally us Kiwis\nsquirm when Australians are selected to play NZ characters . However\nJason Clarke did admirably and he never really tried to do the kiwi\naccent . Thankfully kiwi Martin Henderson played his assistant. Over\nall I felt the movie gave a good summary of the events that happened in\n96 , although Rob Hall probably needs a separate movie. The events\nhappened over 48 hours so it would have been a stretch to try and\ncontain everything in 2hrs. I was satisfied at the portrayal of Rob\nHall.

{"review": "\nWhat killed this movie for me the most was their attempt at\n\"docu-dramism\" where they tried too much to be almost a documentary\nrather than a dramatic film. Things are told but never felt. You know\nsome things about the characters but you never get to know them. There\nis little time spent in establishing them as people.<br><br>The biggest reason for that is that the film never really settles on a\nprotagonist, but just sort of jumps from person to person. The film\nwould have been a lot better if it had told just one person's story,\nthen maybe it could have created some feeling in the viewer.<br><br>But besides all that Everest is by no means a bad film. What it does\nwell is give you a sense of the experience of mountain climbing and the\nmind numbing danger of it all.<br><br>Everest is not a bad film, especially for a large screen experience,\nbut drama wise it left me wanting more.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Everest\" is the type of film that one wants to see because it offers\nthe opportunity to see a very special part of the world, the most\nimpressive mountains on the planet, majestic, forbidden territory, the\nultimate challenge for those who dare to go there.<br><br>The story introduces a group of people who are apparently ready to take\non the challenge. Some are going for the first time, some are veterans\nand have climbed a few of the other peaks in the chain. It becomes\napparent that they will be able to handle most of what is there, and\nsome might not make it, but what we don't know is how different the\noutcome will be because one element they haven't considered is the\nunpredictability of the elements in nature.<br><br>We are giving a passable amount of background, which becomes a weakness\nhere. There's too many characters to follow, and the screenwriter just\nfails to focus on two or three of them, trying too hard to introduce\ntoo many, neglecting to focus on what should have been the main\nelement, the challenge, the power of the mountain, the impending\npossibility that nothing should be taken for granted. Considerable care\ngoes into telling us what could happen if something goes wrong, but it\nnever feels as if we are there with the expedition members. We get to\nsee them play the roles, but they are sketchy performances. We know we\nhave jocks, addicts, adrenaline junkies, etc. We never really get to\nknow anyone. It's a pity because Gyllenthal, Brolin, and other fine\nactors are given little to work with.<br><br>One thing that stands out is that the trip never feels that special.\nYes, the winds are there, the storms are loud and deadly, the\ntemperatures can maim and kill you because they're part of the film,\nbut the emotional build up is weak, and we see something that is\nneither a good documentary or a very dramatic film.

{"review": "\nEvery year lots of people try to reach the summit of Mount Everest\nguided by their passion to a mountain both beautiful and dangerous, a\ndesire to reach what so few have managed to achieve even if their own\nbody suffer unspeakable pain from the agonizing freezing temperature,\nEverest does it very well as building up the characters, telling their\nbackgrounds, the explanation of why they're doing something so\ndangerous. Due to the camera angles, a vertigo sensation can be felt as\nthe viewers glimpse huge cliffs and tops far away from the ground. The\nfilm creates a torturing atmosphere where the audience is affected by\nthe characters' suffering and there is no uniformity in the characters,\neach one has their own personality, their own reason for doing\nsomething so dangerous, making them more captivating. Regarding the\nsetting, there're some scenes which were actually shot in real\nlocations, such as Nepal, and others that CGI does most of the work. In\nthese scenes, the visual effects are impressive, although some scenes\nit's perceptible. The casting is composed by many good and talented\nactors and actresses, they deliver solid characters and when it's\nrequired a deep and emotional acting, they're convincing and\nheartbroken. The one who stands out is Jason Clarke, his character has\nsuch a charisma much due to his love for his family and they are his\nfoundation to keep trying to survive the catastrophe.<br><br>The film is confusing, not of having a complex plot, but in it, some\nscenes seems to be dislocated or doesn't fit. There're several scenes\nthroughout the movie where what happens in them aren't talked about\nlater in the picture.

{"review": "\n'EVEREST': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br><br>Disaster flick, based on actual events; detailing the fatal attempts of\ntwo exhibition groups, to summit Mount Everest.

It's a slow moving, but ultimately intense, mountain\nclimbing adventure flick; not great, but definitely worth the watch.<br><br>The film takes place in 1996; and follows a very experienced mountain\nguide, named Rob Hall (Clarke). Gyllenhaal plays Scott Fischer; another\nvery skilled guide, who led another group up Everest. Other climbers\nincluded a doctor named Beck Weathers (Brolin), and a mailman named\nDoug Hansen (Hawkes). The movie details their disastrous attempts, to\nreach the summit that spring (and come back down), as well as many\nothers. <br><br>The first half of the movie is extremely slow-paced, it did help me to\nget to know, and care for, a lot of the main characters though. The\nsecond half of the film is both suspenseful and visually spectacular\n(it especially looks beautiful in 3D). It's also pretty depressing; and\nI was surprised to learn which characters survived, and which didn't.\nThe directing is decent, and I like most of the main cast (especially\nGyllenhaal).

I only saw it on XD 3D but still I didn't get a sense that I\nneeded to see it on a bigger screen since it wasn't that impressive.\nThe characters were interesting at first and they did a decent job\ngiving them background to generate sympathy for later. However, once\nthey got to the top it seemed frustrating as an audience member that\ntheir ill-prepared venture wasn't foreshadowed more. I thought these\nguys knew what they were doing.

Writers William\nNicholson (Gladiator - 2000) and Simon Beauofy (Slumdog Millionaire -\n2008) don't over write the events, instead they let the location and\nthe situation speak for itself. While the film is packed with plenty of\nfamiliar faces (Jason Clark, John Hawkes, Emily Watson, Keira Knightly,\nJosh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal and Robin Wright - to name a few), many\nhave not been casted in such a unique setting, and thus their\nperformances are realistic and note worthy.
