Can't\ncomment on that only on how the movie felt.<br><br>And it felt kinda freeing (no pun intended) to some regard. Especially\nafter leaving the one location plot from the first movie. A lot of new\ncharacters get introduced and some nice actors join in on the act.\nWhether you like it or not will depend on if you know where this is\ngoing. It's going actually pretty dark and I didn't expect to see those\n\"creatures\" to be honest. The effects are more than decent and the\nmovie has a nice pace to it (15 minutes of outtakes was a bit excessive\nthough, on the disc, but you can tell they had fun making the movie)\n"},{"review": "\n\"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\" is the sequel of \"The Maze Runner\" and\nit continues from the point that the Gladers escaped from the maze.\nAfter their escape they face another obstacles and difficulties in a\nvery hostile environment.<br><br>I have to admit that my expectations about this movie was higher than\nthe first one and that was my mistake. Apparently this movie is as I\nwrote in my title just a transitional stage that guides us to the third\nmovie. This movie consists with a lot of new information that makes it\na little bit boring. This has as a result the action scenes of it to\nseem not as good as it is. The direction of this movie was made by Wes\nBall as in the first one. Dylan O'Brien did his best for this movie one\nmore time but this time his interpretation was not enough. <br><br>Lastly I believe that \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\" is not a bad\nmovie but eventually when it is compared with the first one then its\nquality is lower. The best thing that you have to do is to be prepared\nand do not have high expectations from this movie.\n"},{"review": "\nI have just finished the book and I have to say that I like the movie\nmore.Sure many important parts of the story were missing and it was a\nbit confusing and without connecting points sometime but at least it\nwasn't so violent and negative as the book. I did not like how it was\nagainst Thomas all the time, I mean common he was suffering almost\nthroughout the whole book. The only bad points in the movie were that\nthe sick people were zombies without explaining how they got sick and\nwhat are the stages and also that Teresa was not significant at all in\nthe movie but in the book she played quite crucial role of the\nbetrayer.

But why\ndo we have to have zombie like \"monsters\" all of a sudden, are they\nzombies, we never really get to know what they are or why or how, we\nget bits and pieces, if they are saving the whole story for a third I\nam not so sure it will work.<br><br>It does have some entertainment value, and we do get more of the story\nand the plot behind it all, but we are missing the creativity and fresh\nfeeling that the first film provided.\n"},{"review": "\nIn the second Maze Runner movie, Thomas and his friends finds out that\nthey haven't been rescued like we saw in the end of the first movie,\nbut WCKD still has them. So they run away to find the resistance and\njoin them. However the road to freedom is spread with zombies. One\nthing you have to keep in mind is the ending of the first film and that\nthe Scorch Trials has nothing to do with the first movie other than\nthat. It's more of a post apocalypse zombie movie. WCKD are the bad\nguys, but someone can't help but ask, what if they aren't? Sure their\nmethods are extreme, but they are trying to find the cure, don't they.\nIs Thomas in the end way too selfish to not want to help find the cure,\nwhen he can easily die at the outside world anyway? The end does help\nput those thoughts at ease and I'm glad that they did. Other than that,\nthe movie was enjoyable, thought it's characters were a little too\nnaive (they walked right into many zombie nests when they could have\neasily walked away from there in the first place!!)

When the first zombies appear, the first\nthing I thought was \"they have got out of original ideas\" and that is a\npity because it could've become a good film to watch just by following\nthe main principles of the first film. <br><br>It just happens that I feel that the zombie concept has been very\nstereotyped and when you see one you have seen all. There are even\nseveral TV series where the main characters are zombies with the same\nbizarre expressions on the face and the perverse convolutions on their\nbodies.<br><br>Another disappointment is the attitude of the main character that in\nmost scenes has the same expression of awe in control. Strangely enough\nthe director has made these scenes with that same expression\nunnecessary long which results making the film to seem boring and slow.<br><br>Thus the genre of the film perhaps should evolve from science fiction\nto horror film.\n"},{"review": "\nIs it really the instalment of next episode of the awesome Maze Runner\nor we were scorched trolled? <br><br>A good start which never finished until the end to keep the audience\nlingering on and on with the expectation of 'something will happen now'\nwhich never happened but only a marathon which Thomas finally decided\nto finish. So this part was dedicated to 'escape' only which they all\nmanaged to do in the beginning and that's all.
