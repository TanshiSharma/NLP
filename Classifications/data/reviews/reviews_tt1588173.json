{"review": "\nThis movie was great! I brought my friends and they thought it was\ngoing to be lame but they ended up loving it just as much as I did! Go\nsee this movie, its adorable! I loved how its dark and gory in a cute\nway. This movie is funny, suspenseful, a little bit of a horror and\nromantic; its the perfect date movie! I don't get scared easily but\nthis movie made me jump a few times... The whole movie i was\nentertained! I was very impressed with the way the make-up and hair\nteam were able to make the zombies so realistic! R was very easy to\nrelate with and this movie has a little bit of everything for everyone.\nI suggest going even if your a bit skeptic about it. Go out and see\nthis movie!\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen I was going to see this movie, i was thinking that it gonna be\nanother teen movie about a girl that's discover the natural identity of\nher boyfriend, but it wasn't like this, it was so much better, with\nalternative focus and interesting events this movie comes with a brand\nnew type of history, a very well produced time line that will keep you\nwith your eyes opened until the last second, it's simply awesome, great\nfor family, adaptable for all ages, and will touch even the youngest\nand the oldest person that goes to see it, it's not a reflexive movie,\nthat will be in your head for a long time, but it's a huge font of\nentertainment, i recommend it for all the people in the world. Of\ncourse, this movie has a lot of existing elements, that make it a\nlittle boring to see, but it's a great film for a Saturday night, to\nsee with your friends. Thanks all of you, and sorry about my English,\ni'm from other country.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was a lot of fun to watch. It is a twist on the zombie genre\nunlike anything you have ever seen. There is nothing too offensive or\ngory in this - the creators kept it clean and not too scary for a\nfull-on zombie flick. There are your typical shot to the head to kill\nthe zombies but those quick scenes are nothing compared to watching 10\nminutes of The Walking Dead or the like. I am always concerned because\nI have seen so many movies over the years where the creators did not\nknow how to properly end the story. So many movies are great the first\nhour and then end poorly. I thought this had one of the best endings I\nhave ever seen. Enjoy!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film isn't your usual Zombie film, yes there is a load of zombies\nin it but it is with a twist. This time it is about good zombies. There\nis still quite a few fight scenes but nothing over the top/too gory.<br><br>I didn't think this plot could work, a zombie and a human forming a\nrelationship? it sounds silly but it actually works! The excellent\nNicholas Hoult portrays 'R' the zombie extremely well and the on screen\nfriendship he forms with Julie (Teresa Palmer) is really touching. OK\nit is a bit predictable but the way it all developed is great and we\nare left with a great ending.<br><br>I think this film will really surprise a few people, it is definitely\nworth watching. A romantic film which includes zombies and is also\nfunny, a winner for me.<br><br>8/10\n"},
{"review": "\nYES..it is another vampire love story movie, but guess what? There's\nbetter humor and of course the point where its definitely a unique type\nof story. The part of the movie that makes it more interesting is they\nmade it to the way comedy/love/vampire gore and most of all action\nscenes to were they should be placed at the right moment. Although, its\nthe typical zombies eat human, who would ever thought of why not making\na Romeo and Juliet zombie kinda movie. Its pure genius, Better\nyet..Props to the person who wrote it. This definitely makes that\nOVERRATED Twilight series SUCKS MORE after watching this. I would\nreally recommend watching it.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst: Zombie with white teeth. Because if there's one thing the human\nflesh eating undead care about, it's dental hygiene. I'm in the first\n37 mins of this movie and I can only ask myself why I wasted my time\n(seeing it free so not my money). And what is Hollywood's obsession\nwith trying to make young ladies like me fall in love with zombies,\nwerewolves and vampires. Are they just setting us up to lower our\nexpectations about all men? Choose between an animal, the undead or the\nactual dead. Honestly, I'm watching this movie as a parody because I\ncannot see how it can be addressed otherwise. I will not address the\nplethora of faults in every scene and in the plot because my fellow\nreviewers have done it justice. Skip this movie. To my friends who are\nmaking me watch this un-ironically; we might have to reconsider our\nrelationship.\n"},
{"review": "\nOld conception, new point of view.

{"review": "\nMy mom was the one who wanted to watch this. I didn't really want to, I\nthought it'd be cheesy and not my kind of my movie. But hey! it ended\nup being of my favorites. I loved that this movie had it all; action,\nromance, thriller, comedy, etc. It wasn't a \"chick flick\" and it wasn't\na movie girls would roll their eyes over because of the action. I loved\nit because I was so engrossed in the film. During the action/thriller\nscenes I was at the end of my seat, hoping everything would turn out\nokay. During the comedy scenes I was falling back laughing at what had\njust happened. During the romance scenes, I was tearing up and even\nthinking of how much I love my boyfriend. I believe any movie that can\nencompass that many emotions into a couple hours, is a movie worth\nwatching.\n"},
{"review": "\nBeing a big fan of Walking Dead television series, my review for \"Warm\nBodies\" is undoubtedly positively biased. It was a good watch with\nseveral good laughs. It also has a nice to see some originality.\nIndeed, I'd rate the movie between a 6 and 7 - closer to 7. Young lead\nNicholas Hoult does a good job with his line-delivery and zombiness.\nThe movie is especially witty and clever in it's initial third or so.\nBeautiful young Teresa Palmer is up to the test to be the lead love\ninterest. She is a bit Tom- boyish, the right amount so. On the lesser\nside John Malkovich has a bit role, maybe not even needed - part of the\nweaker side of the story involving human fighters. Worth a watch,\nespecially for zombie fans.\n"},
{"review": "\nWARM BODIES marketing campaign probably hurt it cuz you couldn't tell\nif it was a romantic comedy WITh zombies or a zombie movie WITH comedy.\nBut we finally watched it and I thought it was very clever and funny.\nHoult &amp; Palmer were terrific. The opening monologue was hilarious and\nimmediately showed how funny sharing the inner thoughts of a zombie\nwould be. LOVED that John Malkovich was the militaristic leader.\nHaven't liked most of the other films Jonathan Levine has made but this\nwas very well done. Romeo &amp; Juliet with a BITE! They satirized\neverything from makeover montages, sidekicks, zombie folklore, etc. And\nthe music used throughout was GREAT! Bravo! Hoult has really grown up\nsince being the little kid in ABOUT A BOY!\n"},
{"review": "\nI feel like most people missed the connection between this movie and\nthe classic romeo and Juliet play. Obviously all the names R, Julie,\nPerry, M and the plot with opposing families give this away. The real\ndifference is that instead of dying together in the name of love, they\nbecome alive together. With R being a zombie his coming to life is\nliteral but even Julie who was sad and lonely in this post-apocalyptic\nworld finds herself at the end because of R. This movie is the untragic\ncomedic zombie romance version of Romeo and Juliet. I think if they\nwould have advertised it more so in this way people would have\nunderstood it better and probably enjoyed it more. As for the movie\nitself the effects were good. Music was fun. Kept me interested the\nwhole time. Just a fun zombie romance for people who are tired of the\nsame old stuff.\n"},
{"review": "\nA movie with the potential of creating a new genre, with the\nmaincharacter being an actual zombie... Which could have given some\nvery needed depth to the hackneyed groaning creatures we all know and\nlove. However, sadly the movie ends up just being another romantic\nflick with supernatural elements for teenagers. I also feel like the\nzombies are very loosely defined, can they smell human flesh? Can they\ncommunicate with each other ? How and when do they become \"bonies\"?\nEven though the movie sometimes tries to be self-critical and even make\nfun of the genre as a whole, I think, just because you know your movie\nis bad, it does not become better. I LOVED the concept, but HATED the\nimplementation.\n"},
{"review": "\nloved it from start to finish, great acting all through,Its a totally\ndifferent take on the whole zombie genre. Its about zombies changing\nand thinking instead of zombies being the bad ones and getting killed\nNicholas Holt did a great job definitely going to recommend this movie\nto friends,family etc, anyone who rates this movie bad is wrong watch\nit, its a feel good romantic,comedy loved it...i am going to watch this\nagain cause thought it was great, it was awesome 9/10 best romantic\ncomedy I've seen in a while all films out now are just alright but when\ni saw this i knew i was going to love it, give it a go it was GREAT. I\nwatched it on good quality too wish i saw this in cinema would've been\nmore amazing, john malokovich did a great job and so did the lead girl,\nnever seen her in anything before, don't want to write any spoilers so\nbetter leave it at that overall feel good movie, lovely romance and\ncomedy, leaves u smiling at the end, lovely movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI rented this film because of the trailer. I'm not a zombie fan, in\nfact this is the first zombie film I've seen, but the trailer was funny\nand I thought, why not? I totally enjoyed this film. It's a sweet, well\nacted, little gem. Analeigh Tipton is brilliant! I will be looking for\nmore of her work in the future. I'm not sure that this film will please\ndie hard zombie fans. Not much gore really and it is more of a love\nstory but it is amusing, down right funny in places, and the characters\nare all likable.\"R\" is not only charming and handsome, the inside of\nhis plane is fabulous, a set that's little bit of paradise for \"quirky\nstuff\" mongers, like me. So overall I certainly recommend this film\nwith the caveat that it is subtle. If you want buckets of blood, a lot\nof violence, amazing CG gore and wild, over the top laughs this\nprobably is not for you, which is fine because I highly recommend it to\njust about everyone else.\n"},
{"review": "\nA Zombie finds love in the shape of a victim's girlfriend and feels\nsomething 'stirring'. Underneath the smart Alec jokes, grim setting and\nZombie 'frolics' what you have here is basically a morality play that\nproves the old adage that 'love conquers all'. The film starts off in\nfamiliar Zombie Apocalypse territory with hordes of the reanimated\nshuffling around an airport then we meet Hoult's 'R' a Zombie clearly\nstruggling with his new found place in things. The most refreshing part\nof the film is not the Zombies and the Land of the Dead-esque situation\nbut the blossoming love story between the leads which is handled\nbrilliantly and sets up the ending very well. All in all a good\n'Rom-com' that plays on its strengths but will probably annoy the hell\nout of hard bitten (heh) Zombie fans.\n"},

As well as being really funny it gives you a different\nperspective on what it could be like to really be a zombie, an area\nwhich hasn't been explored yet which is why i am so excited about it,\nand is as action packed and Gory as most of the other zombie flicks.\nWatch and enjoy.\n"},

But that's the first time you can see walking dead actually\nhaving a heart and can love. <br><br>At the end that was the cure LOVE.Overall a really nice movie for\neveryone that conveys more than just being clich\u00e9 romance.

{"review": "\nIt was not formula. Kind of a strange way to start a review, I know.

But that would have been\nformula.<br><br>As a die-hard zombie fan who has enjoyed everything from Fulci to\nRomero, every blood-soaked, entrail littered set and corny line, this\nwas not what I had expected. It was much better than I had assumed, it\nwas something thoughtful, not strictly a romance or a horror flick. It\nhas a heart and a soul, which is what this world around us has lost.\nAnd what this movie is all about.\n"},

He sheds a humorous light on his\npredicament and you're immediately rooting for him. The actual plot of\nthe movie, while not totally unique, is oddly refreshing. You get the\nsense that both R and Julie are sincere &amp; not that much different from\nany other teens their ages. They're just in another place and time.<br><br>Warm Bodies has elements of sci-fi, action/adventure, romance, drama,\nand comedy.

{"review": "\nI'm a guy that loves his zombie flicks. A few of my favs are Romero's\nzombie franchise, Shaun of the Dead, Dead Alive, Planet Terror, and\nZombieland. It could be argued that this movie is the 'Zombie Twilight'\nIn a way, it is, but it's actually done very well. The acting is good,\nand the characters are likable.

{"review": "\nConsidered to be a science fiction film, warm bodies was directed by\nJonathan Levine in January 2013.

After an apocalypse in the USA, the survivors\nlive in a city surrounded by tall and thick walls for protection.\nJulie, among others, is sent on a mission on the outside, where the\ngroup is attacked by zombies. R eats Julie's boyfriend's brain, gets\nall his memories and falls for her. He saves the girl from the other\nzombies and hides her in the plane where he lives. They develop a\nrelationship and become friends. Soon the zombies change their emotions\nand are capable to dream, but the Bonnies, the evil zombies, are after\nJulie and R. The movie has incredible special effects and very\nrealistic make up and costumes. It also has excellent performances.\nIt's a fantastic film to enjoy in family.

Aside from the absolutely\nludicrous concept you have a movie with a lot of heart not much\nsubstance but I guess you can't have everything.<br><br>I'm glad I watched this movie but I don't think I need to ever again.\nThey put it all out on the screen with no hidden messages that make you\nwant to come back for more unfortunately.

{"review": "\nTo paraphrase the oft moaned female lament, \"He couldn't keep it up.\"\nZombie film as told from a detached, wry, dryly humorous soul. Hmm, do\nzombies even have souls? Pointedly funny, satirical contrast of\ndisconnected vs dead. Brilliant flash of the zombie recollection of\n\"happy\" disconnected humanity, lurching their ways, eyes glued to\ncellphones and similar devices. Thirty minutes on, love enters the\nnarrative and the overall edge wilts. Movie turns romantic, then\npreachy. Rom com, at least in this movie, does not equate to razor\nhoned satire. The story gets mushy. For zombie gourmands, very few\nunhappy meals.\n"},
{"review": "\nA zombie horror-drama-romance? Really? Sounds cool. Was it? In all\nhonesty, I didn't believe it could become my favorite movie of 2013,\nbut it did.

The music was perfect, blended into\nevery scene, and was truly meaningful. Zombies communicating their\nfeelings to living humans through old records was brilliant, and the\nrest of the score amazingly relevant at every scene. This was the final\npiece of the puzzle that planted this movie in my mind enough to watch\nit over and over. The Hollywood elite will never give it the credit it\ndeserves, but it was better than any of the Golden Globe winners.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am a big fan of zombie movies. This was a cute movie, however a bit\nslow, the romance between the two heroes of the movie was dragged out\ntoo long and made the movie a bit slow and kind of boring. I think they\nshould have shortened the scenes on the plane where the Zombie R is\nliving and added in a little bit more action. However,there were some\nexciting parts where they are battling the zombies. Funny parts too\nwhich are cute. I think it may have also needed a bit more history of\nthe characters. The parts with John Malkovich were really good, because\nJohn Malkovich is just awesome. Nice movie to rent on a Saturday night,\nbut not in the same league with Resident Evil zombie movies. However,\nthis movie is a bit more heartwarming rather than bleak, there is hope\nfor the zombies.\n"},
{"review": "\nYou have to decide. You can chose to be someone better than who you\nare, or you can give up and be a walking corpse. You can either help,\nor stand in the way.

Too much time on my hands? Well, yes, but so what? AND THE\nSOUNDTRACK, ROCKED 80s - Cory Hart, GnR, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and\nsome Indie stuff. Just watch it already.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen my girlfriend put this movie on, I expected something clich\u00e9 and\nboring like Twilight, but I have to say that I was rather impressed.<br><br>I like how much comedy they managed to push into the movie and for me\nmade it worth watching.<br><br>Of course, there was some clich\u00e9 moments but still, the movie was\nunique in it's own way and didn't bore me one bit.<br><br>This is actually quite the achievement in my opinion since most movies\nhave moments that makes me want to go asleep instead of watching the\nrest.<br><br>Good job!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie you must have seen! And when you watch the movie you begin\ntoo love the zombie! A must see for all comedy, romance and horror\nfans! SPOILER! You just see at the begin that the zombie walks around,\nand the most people just think \"OH this movie gonna be bored\". But\nafter 10 minutes you can't stop Watching! SPOILER ENDED! And what this\nmovie do fantastic are the actors and actress! You have Nicholas Hoult\nas A, He plays fantastic. You have Teresa Palmer as Julie. Teresa and\nNicholas are perfect together in this movie. So go and watch this\nmovie! :)<br><br>Vanessa B.\n"},
{"review": "\nNo spoilers here so don't worry.<br><br>So I began watching this film with the intent of just making fun of it\nand laughing AT what was going on rather than WITH the intended jokes.\nBecause to be honest, a ZOMBIE ROMANCE FILM? C'mon. Zombies are\nprobably the least romantic and attractive of the supernatural\ncategory. But man, was I surprised.<br><br>From the first moment, I was completely invested in the fate of the\nmain character because of his dry, awkward sense of humour. I only\nrealised after a while that he's played by Nicholas Hoult, i.e., the\nBeast from X Men: First Class.<br><br>And sure, the basic plot of the film is a bit predictable but by the\ntime the viewers reach that point, they honestly wouldn't care or would\ncompletely agree.<br><br>This film promises to make you laugh and fulfill your wish of a romance\ngenre too in a high school teen romance between a pretty girl with an\noverprotective father and an awkward social outcast who just HAPPENS to\nbe a zombie in an apocalyptic scenario.<br><br>I'd give it a 7/10 overall and I suggest you all watch it!\n"},
{"review": "\nFunny, I was going to watch \"Cloud Atlas\" as a \"transformational\" movie\nand then watch this as entertainment. I decided to go straight to the\nentertainment and I think it had a great and healing message and I had\nfun too! I love seeing Nick Hoult! He did a great job! Even John\nMalkovich seemed normal-ish!It's a romance so it is a movie about love\nand unconditional love and going for it with your heart, even when you\ndon't one! I liked that the CG stuff wasn't overdone so the movie had\nan organic feel. This added to the realism in the movie. SO many movies\nnow days don't integrate their CG well and it ends up looking cartoon\nlike where it should not. All in all, a very enjoyable movie!\n"},
{"review": "\nI suppose that's the best way for me to describe this movie. Don't get\nme wrong, it's definitely a good movie. But it's cute, too, which is a\ngood thing because that's the point.<br><br>Zombie boy sees girl w hearts in his eyes, kills her boyfriend, eats\nhis brain, sees his memories, and falls even more for the girl.<br><br>Speaking of the girl, it's pretty interesting that the lead that was\nchosen is one who looks like an attractive version of Twilight's\nKristen Stewart. That can't have been an accident.<br><br>This is one of those movies that is an off-the-shelf date movie, or one\nto just enjoy on your own if you like zombies. I'm not interested in\nHollywood pushing Nicholas Hoult down our throats (ugh, Jack, anyone)\nbut he was good in this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie contains booth horror and lots of love, great for couples\nand everyone who has the age required for this movie :)<br><br>The Boy \"R\" meets a lovely girl when she and a \"team\" are looking for\nmedicines for the human camp. People with hearts, zombies and bones\nwhich have been zombies for so long that they can't become human again.\nIf the movie should have been any better I think another actor would\nfit the role as dad in this movie better. The role is well played by\nJohn Malkovich, but not well enough. The movie also have other\nweaknesses as it is too overdone in the way of editing special effects.<br><br>Great movie overall and sometimes touching, I give it therefore 8/10\n"},
{"review": "\nEven though the acting was good, (I Love Teresa Palmer and John\nMalcovich)this was just a horrible movie in my opinion. Just the\npremise of the movie was awful, Its basically a zombie movie meets\ntwilight, I mean really? I can't believe as many people liked this\nmovie- I couldn't even watch it all the way through, I skipped around\nto see if there was any kind of problem that arises in the plot but it\nwas basically: so a girl real living girl falls in love with a rotten\ndead corpse (and no I'm not talking about Anna Nichole Smith) Do your\nresearch before you think \"Well Teresa Palmer is hot and I like zombie\nmovies\" like I did because chances are you will be HIGHLY disappointed.<br><br>Thanks For Reading.\n"},
{"review": "\nA quite different take on the zombie theme. On the surface a dumb and\ndumber premise but artfully handled and nice allusions to Zombie lit,\nShakespeare and world politics. This film is often surprisingly\nbeautifully shot with some nicely understated CGI and even more\nunderstated humour (even if occasionally borrowing from Shaun of the\nDead...but who could resist?).<br><br>Not rip roaring laughs but delicate film making meshed with dumb zombie\nhumour in a way that somehow works. Overall premise seems a bit cheesy\nbut supported by the film's metaphor of accepting/understanding others\n... difficult when someone wants your brains.\n"},
{"review": "\nIts my best Zombie film I've ever seen. Undoubtedly the whole team\nworked hard for the result I guess . I assure again that they are\nsucceeded, my ratings anyway is 7.4.<br><br>Music : The stuff which kept alert and amused and puzzled me is the\nmusic. Nice choice and nice tracks according to feelings and\nexpressions. I will give 8.5 for the music.<br><br>Acting : Nicholas is so hot and damn handsome zombie I admit. He did\ngood. Palmer was looking so cute and sweet here that I wish I could be\nthere. Her stuff was cool. The supporting roles were average. However I\nrate acting 7.5.<br><br>Direction : Better than many other zombie films I've seen. Thanks to\nthe director for reducing violation and brought some sweet thing in\nthis type of film. (7.2)<br><br>Dialogues : Liked it. (7.5)<br><br>Screenings and Scripts : could be better to make it masterpiece. (6.8)<br><br>Story : Well on the air. (7.1)<br><br>I liked the biography of Nicholas also.<br><br>So guys don't miss the Zombie Romance.\n"},
{"review": "\nI really liked this one. In most zombie movies the zombies are bad and\na representation of evil and have to be cured by some magical potion.\nHere zombies are represented in the beginning as bad but then they\nstart to change by themselves with their will, which is what struck me.\nIt is a movie that shows that change must come from the inside and that\nit is always possible. And also that the strongest changing force is\nlove. The movie's love story is beautiful because it is not pushed,\nunrealistic, and badly paced. At the end, it makes sense that she loves\nhim. The theme of the movie is not shoved in your face. Julie's dad was\nwhat I thought the movie would fail with. I expected him to be stuck\nup, unwilling to accept to the degree of being ridiculous, but he\nwasn't. It was a pleasant surprise as him not understanding went only\nso far and it didn't ruin the movie. I was touched by R's willing to\nchange. Great music, perfect pacing of the story. At times it is a\nlittle predictable but in a good manner because what you expect to\nhappen, must happen. Overall, a very good movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nyou know what..this isn't an academy award winner, but neither is it\ndisappointing..its just rather nice, and quite fun...and when you see\nthe leads...any decent film watcher will tell you this couple are\nfuture stars...they are lovely in something so silly yet so rather\nsweetly entertaining that i wouldn't dare bother a criticism..i raise a\nglass to two future stars...two very warm and enjoyable bodies\nindeed...you don't need the academy or the split up into\ncinematography, script, plot etc etc etc for this one...just enjoy it\nand shut up...its like watching future potential academy awards in\ntheir infancy...this pair have it...and good luck to them...\n"},
{"review": "\nIt is surprisingly refreshing.Its not another brainless teen-shitty\nmovie. It is based on isaac marion's novel of the name.Clearly this\nmovie offers a fresh perspective on the zombie apocalypse concept.One\nof the few movies i have seen that tells a story from a zombie's point\nof view.this movie is the journey of a zombie towards personhood\nthrough the path of love and empathy.And i am glad to say that the\ndirector has almost pulled it off.My only critique - the bonies were a\ndisappointment!This movie also reminds me of romeo and juliet.But if\nyou are not a big fan of romance then i would suggest not to go for\nthis movie.For all others its truly worth a watch.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen I first heard the premise of Warm Bodies, I thought that it could\nbe a serious flop. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my\ninitial thoughts were completely wrong. This film has a refreshing plot\nthat is really quite different than anything else I have seen. Not only\nis it quirky and extremely funny it places, but it also carries a great\nmessage of open-mindedness and acceptance. It has a romantic storyline\nthat keeps the viewer rooting for the two lead roles the entire movie,\nwho both happen to have great chemistry together. They keep the romance\nquite lively (hardy har har). Strange as it feels at first, you find\nyourself hoping the zombie gets his girl.I found Warm Bodies to be very\nentertaining, and quite charming.\n"}
