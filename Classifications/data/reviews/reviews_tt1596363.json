{"review": "\nI will keep the review simple. Although some of the financial jargon\nwent over my head, i would say Adam McKay is a genius, to make a movie\nabout the financial crisis this much entertaining, funny and touching\nthat's a feat only few filmmakers can pull off, and a lot of that has\nto do with the tremendous cast of this movie. The Big Short has a large\nensemble cast but focuses on four major players who benefited in\nvarious ways from betting against the American economy. Steve Carell\ngives one of the best performance of his career, Christian bale\nportrays the awkward lonely genius with ease. Ryan gosling is slick\nover the top and funny in this movie he also makes the whole thing much\nmore interesting. Brad Pitt is kind of a good guy and the moral center.\nThis is a must see, and needs multiple viewings to truly appreciate.\n"},
{"review": "\nDon't know how Adam McKay made deplorable humans, blinding fear,\ngut-boiling outrage and gleeful shaming so much fun to watch. He\nbrought along his bag o' laffs but planted them in such rich soil so we\nhad to hack our way through the thick underbrush of tainted greenbacks\nand marked decks.<br><br>Everyone's in top form. Didn't recognize Brad Pitt for awhile. Ryan\nGosling funniest. Christian Bale let us feel his pain and lonely\ngenius. Steve Carell dug deep and came up with a real mensch.<br><br>Nice to see Marisa Tomei, Hamish Linklater, John Magaro, Rafe Spall,\nFinn Wittrock, Max Greenfield and talented others working at a solid\nlevel.<br><br>I walked out of the Westwood Bruin Theater in awe and mad as hell.\n"},
{"review": "\nNot really an accurate portrayal of the housing bust. The movie makes\nit out like these few people were the only ones who knew there was a\nproblem brewing. Uh, no, zillions of people knew as early as 2004,\nincluding me, and I'm no Einstein. What set these guys apart is that\nthey figured out a good way to profit from the coming collapse,\nalthough it was never made exactly clear just what sort of percentage\nreturn they made.<br><br>The Michael Burry character was portrayed as an annoying mental case\nwhich seemed wrong to me since I've seen videos of the guy giving\nvarious speeches and he never struck me as a nutjob except in this\nmovie.<br><br>Didn't care for the bimbo in the bathtub explaining financial jargon to\nthe viewers. Very contrived.<br><br>No laying of any blame on the people who bought houses they couldn't\nafford. A lot of those people were closer to idiots than victims. The\nvictim was ME, I bailed all you dumbasses out and you'd better believe\nit ain't over yet! Round 2 coming up.\n"},
{"review": "\nAbsolutely same story of the protagonists (Brad Pitt, Christian Bale\nand Steve Carrell). They could have rather avoided making each scene\nfrom all three guys' perspective. It is like same scene repeated twice.\nThe movie which pretends to be informative, is full of errors.\nChristian bale in one scene says loan to value is 5. This makes no\nsense, he probably meant loan to equity. The Jenga tower was made\nwrong. It was showing AAA to be most risky. Most of the speeches were\ncynical with little meat. The key climatic speech by Steve had no logic\nand only rhetoric like \"I have no issues in telling you that you are\nwrong\". But do you also have any reasons why the said person is wrong.\nAvoid, if you possible. Much more interesting documentaries are\navailable on the housing crisis.\n"},
{"review": "\nAccomplished and informative movie from Adam McKay and his team.\nSpecial kudos to Hank Corwin for his fast but never flashy editing.<br><br>Superbly acted, with a nice little part for co-producer Brad Pitt, who\nis always at his best in supporting roles.<br><br>Looking at some of the message board postings about this movie, it's\nevident that the blame game for the financial meltdown of 2007/8\ncontinues, which kind of misses the point of the movie, which is that\nthe whole thing has started up again. Neither governments, nor banks,\nnor the public seem to care enough about the damage of a cycle of boom\nand bust to really do anything about it. They \u0096 we \u0096 smell money.<br><br>Excellent film. Mostly funny. Ultimately bleak.\n"},
{"review": "\nSome good acting (I especially like Bale) and interesting tricks like\nhaving actors talk to the audience and having celebrities explain\ncomplex financial deals.<br><br>Unfortunately it distorts reality to match a Leftist viewpoint, and\nrepeats ad nauseam how evil bankers are. Conveniently left out is the\npressure the government put on banks. Check out the history of the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act, particularly Bill Clinton's \"coup de\nwhiskey\" which forced banks to accept junk housing loans. This is why\nsuch a large percentage of mortgages failed. This was NOT mentioned in\nthe film; how can this not be relevant?<br><br>Also, it was well known that housing loans were in trouble before the\ncrash. I remember a cover article in The Economist predicting disaster\nin housing around 2005. I think the bankers were thinking, yeah, it's\ncrazy, but the government is forcing us to do it so they are going to\ncover these loans in the end so they are secure.<br><br>At least with Michael Moore you know he is lying to you; with this\nmovie a lot of people accept it as fact.\n"},
{"review": "\nI will be quite blunt. And very short. Avoid this item (I would not\ncall it a movie) at any cost! First of all, this is not a feature film.\nThere is a story but annoyingly not adapted through a 'movie\nscreenplay'. Too bad Randolph! I'd rather call it a hybrid of a feature\nand a documentary but a badly mutilated cloning job by Adam McKay.\nActing is generally OK, but Burry's character is really annoying. Worst\nis its infuriatingly hopelessly portrayed by Bale. Pitt is not worth\nhis salt and Steve Carell is the only one worth mentioning. The main\nproblem with this item is the absence of electrifying and captivating\nconnection that is really needed in each frame of the movie on one of\nthe biggest financial scams of our time. Just lame!\n"},

The acting is fine and it's not poorly done at all-\nit's just basically nothing to see. I kept waiting for something to\nkick in- story, characters- something!

Who is the intended demographic??\nAgain, maybe it's just me and I'm hung up on films with action,\ninteresting characters and a colorful story and setting, but I can't\neven squeeze hard and push out something cool to say about this film. I\nreally wish I could. It's like expecting a rock concert and getting to\nread a newspaper instead.\n"},
{"review": "\nAs a person who understands how this housing bubble burst (not affected\npersonally) - this is a well told story.

The individual characters are all well acted and developed.\nMany people do not get that the banks play games with the average\nperson - as it says at the end of the movie - they just use different\nwords for their products. The main focus of the bank is to make money -\nnot help the consumer and this was rampant in the 90's. People need a\nplace to live - do not put down your income-or lack of. Leave some of\nthe questions blank - no one will care by the time it gets passed off\nand passed off and passed off and approved. ARM's - to me an automatic\nmoney maker for the mortgage holder and not the homeowner - oh that is\nright the mortgage holder owns the home.

{"review": "\nBoth the CDO and the MBS are non-tangible, complex assets. How complex\nare they? Watch this movie to find out.

You have a perfect storm. I am NOT a Brad Pitt fan, however,\nhe puts in a solid performance. Steven Carrell (sp) is one of my\nfavorites because he brings it. He brought it in The Office (TV), Brad\nAlmighty, Foxcatcher, and now - The Big Short. He carried the movie\nwell. As in all books that I have ever read, the movie is a bit clip of\nthe book, however, it was 2 hours and 2 minutes WELL spent and there\nwas nary an empty seat in the theatre on a Saturday over a holiday\nweekend.

Adam\nMcKay has crafted a masterpiece for the ages. He clearly possesses a\nbrilliant mind. What astonishes me is that he wastes his considerable\ntalents on dreck like \"Anchorman\" and \"Talladega Nights\" and \"Step\nBrothers.\" Why? I mean, WHY?!?!?! It just don't add up!

{"review": "\n\"The Big Short\" is a good film but also a film that would be tough for\nthe average viewer to enjoy and understand. This is because although\nthe housing bubble's burst was a mess and destroyed a lot of peoples'\nlives, few folks really understand it. Sure, folks know that the banks\nwere foolish as were home buyers (since they couldn't possibly afford\nthese homes)....but that's about as far as their understanding goes.\nAnd, with the film tossing around all sorts of insider jargon, it's\nsure to confuse more than entertain. <br><br>What I would LOVE to see is a pop-up video version of the film with\nexplanatory text appearing on the screen throughout the movie to\nfurther clarify what is happening. I've seen several Japanese import\nfilms like this--and they helped to explain cultural references that\nmost non-Japanese viewers would miss. <br><br>The bottom line is that I am extremely well educated compared to the\naverage person and yet I sometimes felt a bit lost.

That is what separates this film\nfrom being merely a documentary and turns it into high drama. <br><br>No matter your politics - mark this, like Citizen Kane, as a movie that\nshould be seen at least once. It is not always comfortable to watch.\nAnd that is a good thing - The Big Short is a documentary of a real\nlife horror that unfolds in slow motion, and reminds us that even after\nthe fact - no one is listening.

{"review": "\n\"The Big Short\" is a good film that offers insights into the economic\ncollapse of 2008.

The dialogue is\ncrisp and lively, and the male-dominated cast handles the pace deftly.<br><br>The theme that emerges from the film is the greed that consumes nearly\nevery character.

{"review": "\nVery good movie. Describes everything to do with the housing crash in\n2007/2008 really well.

This is our\nguide, this is reality, this is what's happening. I'll be planning to\nread the book as well so I can dig in and understand some points that a\nnormal person like me doesn't know. It's my first time writing a movie\nreview, and this movie just got into my nerves! I have no idea I might\nend up writing here! LoL it was just so good! I just saw Ryan Gosling's\nname so I decided to watch ha-ha! and then there's Christian Bayle! of\ncourse Brad Pitt, It's like what the hell is this movie and they're all\nhere? So I tried to look and I was stunned like what am I watching ??\nwhat is this ??? The stars really did a great job in this movie!! So\nyea Congratulations to everyone!\n"},

How can people be so irresponsible and unaccountable?\nEveryone needs to see this movie to wake up and start asking questions.\nChristian Bale, Steve Carell are fabulous and the script is awesome.\nWonder where Christian, Steve, Brad, and Ryan are investing their money\nnow. I seriously doubt their money is invested on Wall Street after\nmaking this movie. Wall street is a ponzi scheme. Madoff was peanuts\ncompared to what Wall street is doing. Do not believe what the 6\no'clock news is telling you. Do not believe what politicians are\ntelling you. Do not believe what economist on TV are telling you.

The general gist is that the are like lambs,\nif you will, swept up by events beyond their control. <br><br>So I was expecting the same white wash, condescending drivel from this\nfilm. Instead I got a humorous, subtle and quite importantly,\nentertaining take on the housing bubble.

Are we really that doomed? I believe that\nalthough the cast was top notch in the end nobody will remember the\nsexy chicks or the high class known actors... but the problem itself!\nand that's excellent... especially from a Hollywood movie thats not\nexpected when you have well paid actors... usually they do the work but\nin this movie that's not the case! <br><br>One word that could describe it, B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L\n"},

In other words, you don't need to\nbe an amateur economist like myself to thoroughly enjoy and grasp the\nstory.<br><br>I think this is an important film that everyone should see. If nothing\nelse, you will get a very in-depth dramatic representation/explanation\nof just exactly what went so terribly wrong in 2007.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt should have been called the Big Rip Off and it shows how absurd the\nwhole thing was. I heard people talking after the show and everyone got\nit. I hope many, many people watch it. The director and the actors'\naccomplishment is not trivial; they get across a complicated mess full\nof arcane words and sordid people in an entertaining two hours. Humor,\nperhaps irony is a better word, is used to make this stuff digestible.\nIn the end the Big Question is who's minding the store. Nobody. Uncle\nSam is too busy looking for a job at a Big Bank. In this case it was\nCousin Samie instead... who ended up in bed with you know who. The\nmovie is full of good metaphors like that. Apparently, of all people,\nonly a young man figured out what was going to happen early on. His\nname is Michael Burry. All the Big Wise Men didn't, or didn't want to.\nWe'll never know. As a footnote, Michael Burry wrote an op-ed in the\nNYT in 2010 asking the Big Question. Within a month he got a visit from\nthe FBI and four audits, probably IRS, SEC, etc. You'd think Uncle Sam\nwould want to hire him instead.\n"},
{"review": "\nUnder zero emotions! The story supposed to be great but it wasn't. That\ndrama was not a drama but just some pieces of stories that this\ndirector tried to joined by force and to give a meaning during its way.\nMost of the biggest troubles was that camera that never stopped shaking\nand zooming in and out and moving up and down with no sense even in the\nmost quiet portrait. There is no need to play with moving camera in\nsenseless way to make the story more dramatic. Big disappointing even\nin some characters there. Not professional. Pretending! I would ask to\nthis director to give me back the time i spent to watch his bullshit\nand maybe to tell to him how he can do this movie in more positive way.\n"},

{"review": "\nI didn't think it would be possible to make an entertaining movie about\na financial crisis, but Adam McKay and Charles Randolph have pulled it\noff. There are some really good performances by the stars, Christian\nBale, Ryan Gosling, and Steve Carell. Especially Carell who plays\nagainst his usual type of the complete buffoon who is unaware that he\nis a buffoon. There were no major or meaty roles for women. Some of the\ngimmicks worked very well, such as breaking the fourth wall, or having\nnon-financial celebrities explain financial matters. The film was more\nthan a bit one-sided, blaming private bankers almost exclusively for\nthe collapse, and letting government off the hook entirely. See Derek\nTetlow's comment 8 or 9 down for that. But it kept me engaged\nthroughout.\n"},
{"review": "\nA little before 2008, investors think the subprime market is going to\ncrash so they bet against it. That's it, that's the plot of the movie\nand it's repeated over and over and over again.

{"review": "\nI normally don't enjoy watching movies/shows about politics or\neconomics as I understand very little of those things, especially\nAmerican (I'm Norwegian).

Although it was a bit hard to follow every\nterm and what was happening all the time, I understood what was going\non, and I was almost at the edge of my seat at times, which has NEVER\nhappened for me before watching a movie like this.

{"review": "\nMore drama and less comedy The Big Short was a pleasant surprise. With\nan expensive cast and a difficult project it helped us understand once\nmore how pathetic can the banks become in order to find profit for\nthemselves and how money, once more, make the world continue to exist.\nGood acting, many message and caustic humour was this movie's recipe.\nAlthough much of what the protagonists said wouldn't make any sense to\nthe common people, they helped us understand them with quite simple\nexamples. Although it was a bit slow at the beginning, it becomes\nbetter as the time passes. True story and sure success, nothing special\nto address. Directing was good and the song of Neil Young gave an\nhonored finale! All movie's music was good and to the point. One\nadvise, don't take this for a comedy like other such as Ted or anything\nlike that. You have to watch it carefully because the plot is full of\ndetails. So, nice try guys!<br><br>6/10\n"},
{"review": "\nTwenty years of my life were spent working in housing finance\neconomics. I got out in the early 90s after the first housing crash\n(when the savings &amp; loan industry also collapsed). The things I saw\nthat inevitably led to that first crash at the end of the 1980s, were\nrepeated on a grander scale and with even more arrogance, greed, and\ncallous criminality than what went before, and led to the economic\ncrash of 2008. This film, while meant as entertainment, is also a\nprimer on what led to the worldwide economic downturn as well as what\nis still wrong with financial markets today since no substantive\nchanges have been made to prevent a recurrence. Nevertheless, it's a\nvery watchable film with terrific performances from the entire cast,\nincluding many who are essentially walk-ons with only a few lines. It's\nneither dry nor dull. In fact, it's very entertaining, depressing as it\ncan be when you realize that almost every bit of it is true.\n"},
{"review": "\n'The Big Short' seems to want to play off the same vibe as 'The Wolf of\nWall Street,' with characters directly addressing the audience and even\nexplaining which scenes are dramatized and which really happened. There\nis even a series of celebrity appearances inserted solely for the\npurpose of explaining the core financial concepts to laymen. Although\ntrying to explain the housing market bubble of 2007/2008 using\nblackjack bet, Jenga tower and seafood cuisine analogies is only\nmarginally successful, the fact that nearly every single scene in this\nmovie involves the various characters discussing, debating, delving\ninto or otherwise taking action related to this bubble basically gets\nthe picture across to the audience. But that, and the fact that it's a\nlong movie and about 95% of it is these same characters waiting for\nsaid bubble to burst, also makes it a rather one-dimensional movie, and\na bit on the dull side at times. Still, it's worth it for the\ninteresting subject matter and a particularly entertaining performance\nby Steve Carrell.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat everyone else said: brilliant movie, educational, entertaining,\netc.<br><br>But the eye-opener for me was Steve Carell. My respect for him as an\nactor skyrocketed after this movie. Maybe I've been missing something,\nbut I've never seen him in a serious role before. When watching this\nmovie, I immediately latched on to Mark Baum as someone to whom I\nshould be paying attention. I later found out that he was played by\nCarell and I had a tough time reconciling that.<br><br>I think Steve Carell has many great dramatic roles in his future and I\nam very pleased with that because I'm not a huge fan of his comedy.

{"review": "\nThis is a strange movie - almost documentary-like with actors\nrecreating scenes from the book and that talk to camera/4th wall\ntechnique of stopping the action and talking directly to the audience\nabout scenes, background or complex terms. I have never before seen\nsomething quite like it before with a great ensemble cast of A list\nactors combined with new faces. The whole thing is done with a great\ndeal of humor - in almost every scene - practically to the point of\nsatire. I thought the movie did a good job of explaining a complex\ntopic, suggesting those responsible while still leaving those final\nconclusions up to the viewer.\n"},
{"review": "\nOverall, a pretty great film that manages to work on both a\nstory-telling level and on a character level, despite how busy it all\nis. The problem is in essence how busy it all is when it didn't need\nto. All of the side-explanations, the wink-wink, fourth-wall breaking\nstuff should not have been there. It was all meant for humor more than\nactual explanations, and that's fine in aim. It just wasn't funny and\nfelt both condescending and just really annoying. The screenplay did a\nfine job of really telling this story so all of that was just\ndistracting. I also think the editing at times attempts to show off\njust for the sake of it, but it also was able to provide the story with\na much- needed pace. It's a conflicting editing achievement, no doubt.\nI think both Christian Bale and Steve Carrell provide some fine work,\nthe latter in particular is more convincing here than he was in last\nyear's Foxcatcher. Both are the emotional anchors of the story and they\ndo very well. The entire cast is superb though, and really gives the\nSpotlight cast a run for their money.\n"},
