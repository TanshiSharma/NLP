{"review": "\nEven though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I\nwould actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10.\nJust saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement.\nThis movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further\nmore it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to\nthe book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was\nleft out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to\nruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to\nfollow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time.\nI highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series\nwith a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly\nHallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action\npacked left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series,\nthough all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and\nthere are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit\nperfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even\nfor those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is\nequally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will\nbe loved for years and years to come.\n"},
{"review": "\nHarry Potter's saga had many directors; I will not go back again to who\nwas the best (hint; a Mexican guy), but by far Mr. Yates was the worst.\nMr. Yates was only interested in make an easy sell PRODUCT. The only\nreason the first was paced was to fill out two movies with only one\nbook. Now, we are at the end so WHO CARES, let's just finish it, get\nthe money and keep going. Clocking barely two hours, it feel rush and\nincomplete; missing lots of interesting (and even important) parts on\none of the richer book of the series. Hermione and Ron do almost\nnothing; the others even less. Harry gets a lot of screen time but not\nnecessary good scenes. Even the battle at Hogwarts (the only part Mr.\nYates seems to be interested ) is a lame copy of \"The Two Towers\"\nwithout any kind of emotion. His direction so bad and unimaginative\nthat when most of the characters die; we do not feel anything. In\nbrief; worth seeing to understand how better the book is and because it\nis the last one; but AVOID any further movies with David Yates as\ndirector.\n"},
{"review": "\nDeathly Hallows works all right as a film, I suppose. My enjoyment of\nit was just spoilt by the total lack of respect shown by the director\nand scriptwriter for the source mat\u00e9riel. The book had a rather good\nplot and not bad characters. Would it have hurt the film that much to\ninclude any of that. No, all of that was junked to put in scenes that\nhad nothing to do with the plot of the book, twist and slant other\nparts of the book plot, ignore quite a lot of important book points and\nsimply never refer to the main plot point of the book at all. Does\nanyone recall anything about what the Deathly Hallows actually were and\nhow many Harry had, if indeed he had any?<br><br>So OK film, terrible, terrible adaption.\n"},

They just forgot that he needs a real\nwand and the one he has that works he breaks in half(elder wand). Well,\nthe movie was so far off from the book... i left angry... angry is not\nthe feeling I should have felt; i am part of the Harry Potter\ngeneration and i feel cheated. I know that many people love the movie\n(most of the people in the theater) and maybe if i see it once more i\nwill enjoy it more.

{"review": "\nThe series ends, at last. Good riddance. (Until JK Rowling needs money,\nI guess).<br><br>The first Harry Potter was interesting, and good fun.

There were\nsome new concepts and characters. All this was enough to make it\nmarginally likable.<br><br>By the third, however, it was a tired formula.

The story was good, and followed the books reasonably well.\nHowever, its production was over-dramatic, to the point where it was\nquite cheesy at times. I found myself laughing at parts that were meant\nto be taken seriously, as they were too drawn out and tried too hard to\nbe gripping. I also felt some of the acting, particularly that by\nMaggie Smith (Professor McGonagall), was quite horrible. A\ndisappointing finish to the series.<br><br>4/10\n"},
{"review": "\nAlan Rickman did an awesome job with his portion of the story - his\ncharacter was never separate from the book character. But the story was\nso rewritten as to miss many points that were important to the story. I\nunderstand how writers want to make the story their own from the\noriginal book writer but the value in the story comes from characters.\nHarry Potter was an introvert played by an extrovert actor. There were\nbits of the story from the book such as the final between Voldemort and\nHarry that went so much deeper to me in the book. Some of that value\nwas lost in how the film portrayed the scene.<br><br>Many shots were filmed so dark as to be almost too dark to be seen. It\nwas a dark story but did not need this lack of creative styling. As\nmuch as I love the books is how much I hate this film.<br><br>The only other positive credit I would give this film was to return to\nJohn William's music for the final scene into the beginning of the end\ncredits!

The first half hour - hour or so is not only quite accurate, but\nalso really good, but as the Battle of Hogwats begins everything go\ndownhill. It is all just a blur of people running around screaming and\nshouting inaudible curses at each other until all the character you\nshould care about, but can't in this mess, are dead and not even after\nthe battle has ended do we get to see what happened to all the people\nwe worried about and that at least I felt sorry for while reading the\nbook.\n"},

The producers and writers mucked up yet another ending.<br><br>I was sorely disappointed with the ending of HBP (Dumbledore's\nfuneral?) but after DH Part I came out and it actually followed the\nbook for the most part, I had high hopes for the ultimate ending to\npart II and to the series. As a devoted fan of Harry and his friends\nand of the books and the movies, I feel cheated. We deserved that\nperfect ending.<br><br>Having expressed my disappointment with the ending, I will say that the\nrest of the movie was fantastic, superb! It was everything I expected\nand more. The only reason I gave the movie 6 stars was because of the\nlast 10 minutes - of the movie - and of the entire series.\n"},
{"review": "\nHP7-Part 2: The wait for every HP movie was long and this one seemed\neven longer as this is where it all ends. But the wait was worth it.\nProbably the best of Harry Potter series.

It had everything we\nwant in HP series, thrill, action, magic, fun. <br><br>One important thing for anyone who reads this review.

{"review": "\nGave movie a generous 8. It may be unfair to rate it lower than others\nhave done as I had read the book. If you've done the same, you may tend\nto rate the movie even lower than I did. It deserved an 8 for no other\nreason than it was exciting and provided fairly good acting. It\ndiffered so from the book, it was sad. The movie seemed to be in a rush\nto conclude the series and provided little in the background stories\nrequired to make it unforgettable. For moviegoers that did not know the\nstory, I would expect some confusion. For those of us that read the\nbook, I would expect plain disappointment. Unlike the conclusion to\nLord of the Rings, this will not be an Oscar contender. I'm surprised\nthat the stories author hasn't complained; my God they had two movie to\ndo the ending properly and they missed entirely. As I read my review,\nI'm reconsidering the 8.

For example when\nharry kills voldemort its shown as if he has killed some normal troll.\nThe movie lacks dialogues, bad screenplay, it all ends very abruptly.\nIn the start the movie is very little fun to watch, well the most\nboring part was when Harry talks to Dumbledore. only girls will be\ncrying in this movie.

Too dark to my liking, it's a good\nthing to express the dark and grim feeling of the book, it's overkill\nto make the film look like everything was shot between dusk and dawn.\nThis effect was even worse in 3D - which again turned out to be a dud.<br><br>Overall the film felt rushed - as if the maker was done with it, glad\nto have the series end. As part of the audience I now feel the same -\nit was a good series to watch through the years but I am happy it is\ndone now.<br><br>Adding that all together makes it the worst part in the series to me,\nfitting but not fitting, pleasing and not pleasing.<br><br>6 out of 10 last rites\n"},
{"review": "\nThroughout the series every movie had something missing. Of course\nevery movie had parts that were cut because they simple didn't have\ntime to show everything. All of that has always bugged me until this.\nThis movie was everything the book couldn't be. While it did have to\ncut out parts that really were important, it said everything it had to\nsay. It finished everything that had to be finished. This movie tied up\nall the loose ends and it did this with a flourish. The action was at\nthe amazing pace that only that 8th instalment of a long series could\nprovide (without disregarding the story). Still a two hour movie of\njust thrills would have been a bit too much and it certainly provided\nsome breaks. Emotional scenes, like Neville coming full circle, showed\nthat as much as the series was about magic none of us could wield, it\nwas also about character that the best of us could aspire to. It was\nbreathtaking. It was triumphant. It was to the fans, to the books, to\nHarry Potter and all the faithful at Hogwarts: Justice.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe final entry into cinema's hugest phenomenon, HPATDH:P2 is also the\nbest in the franchise. The action is unlike anything you've seen in the\nPotter universe before; the showdown at Hogwarts is worth the price of\nadmission all on its own. The characters are all given suitably\nmemorable moments in their last outing \u0096 Maggie Smith's Professor\nMcGonagall and Julie Walter's Molly Weasley are allowed to get their\nbadass on, which is, quite simply, awesome \u0096 and there's a nice little\nepilogue that provides a fitting finale for the main trio at the centre\nof it all. With Alexandre's Desplat stirring score and the\nwell-rendered 3D thrown into the mix, this series-closer is as epic as\nit deserves to be.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is an average film at best. A great disappointment to a Harry\nPotter fan who read the books and a \"take it or leave it film\" to those\nthat didn't but watched the films. They could have done unbelievably\nbetter in time management about horocruxes and the battle scenes in\ngeneral were not very intense. If this wasn't the last film, I would\nnot go to see the next. The only good part was how the Deathly Hollows\nwere portrayed. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint as always are perfect in\ntheir roles. It is unfortunate that the screenplay writer, Steve Kloves\nand director, David Yates had to adapt the books to film in such a way\nbecause the last film had great potential. Still worth watching only\nbecause it is the last film.\n"},
{"review": "\nWell, actually i enjoyed every film of Harry Potter just for the reason\nof watching a dream come true, though i always say that it's difficult\nto surpass a book story. In this case, i think that to split the film\ninto two parts was necessary because the amount of events developed.\nHowever, the first part was pretty disappointing according to the lack\nof dynamism. the story falls in \"stand by\" for a long time focusing on\nthe relationship among Harry, Granger and Ron. I think that the result\nis a matter of get things done in the easiest way, so Yates avoid\ndifficult scenes as well as combat situations with a high need of\nspecial effects and stunts. How come that Moody, one of the best\nAurors, died without a clue of what happened? From my point of view,\nafter Harry Potter and the Gobblet of Fire, the movie is going down in\nquality.<br><br>www.cubareviews.wordpress.com\n"},
{"review": "\nI think overall the ending to this series of films was great. I don't\nthink they could of done anything more than they did, unless they made\nthe film longer to put in more of the book. obviously they cant put\nevery detail from the book in the films but somethings i don't thing\nmade sense because we didn't see them on camera like the polyjuice\npotion you never saw Hermione take it to turn into Belatrix. Little\nthings like that i think would of made the audience love the film.<br><br>I enjoyed the film through out that is possible the only thing i\nthought was a little disappointing. My favourite part was when Mrs\nWeasley stepped in for Ginny and said a line from the book. true potter\nfans loved that part as I've spoke to a fair few that love that scene.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was never really a fan of Harry Potter and especially the movies. But\nI gotta admit this final installment was just awesome. It wasn't as\nepic as I thought it would be but it's still epic. The plot also has\nsome very emotional twist and turns that will make some viewers cry a\nlittle while watching. The girl next to me couldn't stop weeping. The\nspecial effects are top notch and the acting is the best in this\nfranchise. I never thought I would be sad to see this franchise finally\nend. But during the final scene it was sad...Well just slightly that\nit's the end. One big gripe I have is how some of the main characters\ngets killed off way too easily and some even off screen. Anyways that\nis just a small complaint, overall this is a movie that is worth seeing\nit in theater. It's a great conclusion to this popular series.<br><br>8.4/10\n"},
{"review": "\nA fantastic conclusion to an epic series... As a critic said, watching\nthe HP films was like watching a hurdles runner that falls down several\ntimes during the race but ends up winner at the end!!! <br><br>In the last film, many many innocent and \"clear\" images from the first\nfilm are reversed (Hodguarts, Central Station, etc) and many characters\nare transformed as the story reaches its darkest twist and all the\nsecrets are out...<br><br>Watching it also showed that was a very wise move to break the last\nbook into 2 films. Part 1 was a road movie, a running adventure, while\nPart 2 is about an epic and long anticipated battle. <br><br>I haven't read not even one from the HP books, but I did watched all\nthe movies. However, I believe that one could watch and enjoy this film\neven if he or she has not seen all the previous ones.

The good wizards stand against Voldermort and\nhis Death Eaters in this battle royale of good versus evil. The second\nhalf of the final book was my favorite part so I was looking forward to\nthis movie. I loved the climatic landscapes of this movie and the way\nthe story comes alive and makes the magic seem real. It was with\nbittersweet sadness that I enjoyed watching this movie knowing that\nthere are no more stories coming. Oddly, I did not feel this way when\nreading the books. I think as I am more of a movie person than a book\nperson I have a stronger connection with the movies. I give this movie\na green light. I truly enjoyed myself while watching the film.

The\ndirection great, the script is written pretty well and I just loved the\nscreenplay. Its stunning visually and the effects are commendable. One\nmore thing is that you will find your heart pacing as more and more\ntime passes. Definitely all you think is that its gonna end now. I\nwatched in 3d and didn't find much use of 3d except 2-3 good scenes. So\nits moreover kind of same if you watch in 2d. The truths when unfold\ndelivers a shock to us.

The action\nscenes are also spectacular and all the money spent on this was\ndefinitely worth it. I also watched this film in 3D which was another\njoy as the effects were fantastic. Also credit has to be given to the\nwriters of the film who tweak some of the plot that was originally in\nthe book but readers should not worry as the scenes that have been\nchanged are still fantastic.

And while the film differs in\nvarious ways from the book, it still captures the emotion and heart of\nwhat the Harry Potter series is about.<br><br>The last forty minutes or so of the film are breathtaking and play on\nyour emotions in such a convincing manner that you forget that you're\nsitting in the theater, especially viewing Snape's story in the\nPensieve and the moment when it dawns upon all three young wizards that\nHarry must die to defeat Voldemort. I don't cry too easy but I started\nto tear up as I watched the three friends embrace one last time as\nHarry headed off to the forest.<br><br>Two words to describe this movie: a MASTERPIECE.

Harry Potter is on a mission to kill Voldemort and\nthose who obey him. Ralph Fiennes' character Voldemort lies about Harry\nPotter being dead, which shows his excellence in acting, then harry\npotter comes back to life and defeats voldemort.
