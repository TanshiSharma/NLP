{"review": "\nAfter watching the trailer i was really hyped about the movie because\nof its theme and potential to be a really good movie. But on the other\nside i knew how bad the most potential good movies in the past ended\nup. I was scared that they screw it up and give us another Oblivion or\nIlisium with much cgi-effects and bad story and no real story and/or\ncharacters. <br><br>So i took my girlfriend and went in the movie with mixed feelings. But\nthen, right from the beginning, i knew this movie would be fantastic.\nThe first minutes really hooked me and i found myself in a funny,\nfilled with perfect action and intelligent movie. You had the feeling\nlike you were directly in it and you really feel with Tom Cruise from\nthe beginning to the end. I don't like Tom Cruise in general but this\nrole just fits him. Nobody who sees this movie could deny this. From\nminute to minute i was more and more in this fantastic story and wanted\nto last forever. But eventually the movie ended and i was really\nsatisfied with everything. <br><br>Two main characters who played perfectly, a fascinating story well told\nand really fast and good looking action made it for me the best movie i\nwatched in a while (and i watch pretty much movies). Even though i\ndon't like to recommend movies because of different tastes I really\nwant to do this with this movie. The story is well told and there are\nno boring repeatings. Even my girlfriend who normally don't like movies\nwith much action liked it a lot and added Emily Blunt to one of her\nfavorite actresses of all time.<br><br>Oh well, 10/10\n"},

{"review": "\nOne of the most ingenious film concepts ever created, a cross between\n'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Groundhog Day', 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a\ngripping and clever blockbuster sci-fi thrill-ride accompanied with\ntaut, fast-paced action and compelling direction. Tom Cruise and Emily\nBlunt form a perfect chemistry that takes them from the training\nground, to the battlefield through to the action-bound finale in Paris.\nThe premise of the time-loop has been used many times before, but this\ntime round there are enough exciting visuals and dynamic storytelling\nskills employed to make this one thrilling (and unexpectedly comedic)\nflick that is unpredictable and expertly designed. A model of cinematic\ncraftsmanship.\n"},
{"review": "\nWith thrilling action sequences, clever sense of humor and surprisingly\nintellectual storyline, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" shows a real deal of summer\nblockbuster movie and proves itself beyond expectation especially after\nunconvincing trailers. Perhaps the theme and alien character looks\nfamiliar with some popular sci-fi movies but it's still combined\nperfectly as an entertainment. Doug Liman as director smartly exploited\n're-setting the day' aspect without making it complicated and escaping\nit from being dull with some quality combat moments also inserting\nlovable drama that is commanded by memorable chemistry from Tom Cruise\nand Emilly Blunt have carried whole scenes in it. Overall \"Edge of\nTomorrow\" feels more satisfying than it might have been in any ways and\nshows how the non-sequel-reboot blockbuster movie should be done. It's\ndefinitely much fun than I have ever imagined and pleasurable to\nre-watch it over and over again.\n"},
{"review": "\nAnother sci-fi movie starring Tom Cruise didn't interest me much. The\ntrailer also didn't give me a clear idea of what this movie was about\nwhich made it even surprisingly good to experience it! The thing about\nmovies like these is that there's a lot of potential to repeat the same\nthings over and over and leave the viewer uninterested. However, every\ntime there was something new so it didn't feel repetitive. There were\nalso elements of humor that were refreshing. The editing should be\nadmired.<br><br>Without giving too much away, I'll say that Tom Cruise (Major Cage) is\nan absolute novice in warfare, who is involuntarily picked for an\nassault on aliens who have taken over Europe. To combat these aliens,\nthe joint forces around the world have developed a armor suit laced\nwith heavy weaponry. He is baffled as to why he was picked when he\nknows nothing about warfare. That part wasn't satisfactorily answered.\nThe first day after combat, he begins to develop symptoms of living the\nsame day over and over again. Baffled, he tries to explain the\nsituation to others who disregard his views. In Rita, he finds someone\nwho can understand his situation.<br><br>There on, it's a thrilling ride of finding out what's causing these\nrepetitions and finding a means to put an end to it. The movie is fast\npaced so no mulling over. Little details of changes in the scenery, how\nCage modifies his behavior both to convince others and to find an\nanswer, and how events unfold are put forth excellently. I'm sure\nenthusiasts can find plot holes aplenty but I found this movie\nthoroughly entertaining. If you're in the mood for watching fast-paced\naction sci-fi, then I definitely recommend this movie!\n"},
{"review": "\nThere are multiple plot strands from other films gathered into a union.\nI won't give you any hint but you'll get it when you see it. Nowadays,\nmovies are short on originality. But, in this case, you won't give a\nthing about it. <br><br>Premise: An inexperience military officer was sent to war to fight an\nalien race invading the earth. In the middle of the battlefield, he got\ninto an accident which causes him to go into time- loop that repeats\neach moment when he dies.<br><br>The basis of the plot looks familiar... That could be a big problem. On\nthe contrary, it succeeded to provide a big summer blockbuster\nsatisfaction. The pacing is perfect, the acting is perfect. Oh, and did\ni mention the effects? It was ragin'!<br><br>See this movie with low expectations (2D or 3D doesn't matter)...\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw the trailer of this, but was expecting another campy\n\"Independence Day\" trying to be too funny, \"War of the Worlds\" that\ntried to be too serious or \"District 9\" that was FX for FX sake. I\nprobably would have not gone, but my date said her daughter saw it and\nloved it.<br><br>Wow, was I surprised! The characters make the movie. Cruise's\nless-than-perfect, frustrated but determined \"Cage\" quickly got me\nrooting for him. Emily Blunt's serious \"Rita\" was a great mirror image\nprotagonist.<br><br>The special effects were so clean and well integrated that they didn't\noverpower the story or become center stage. Instead, they added to\nbringing in me into making the unreal premise more real.<br><br>In the end, this is probably the coolest sci-fi love story I have ever\nseen. It is nice to see that Hollywood can still produce something\nother than the formulaic trash that usually keeps me away from the\ntheaters. Warner Brothers, thanks for putting $178 million on the table\nto make this!\n"},

{"review": "\nI've been waiting for HBO to broadcast this film for quite some time\nand I had high expectations based on the positive reviews this film has\ngarnered. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed, and I'll tell you\nwhy without spoiling anything.<br><br>Now I won't go on and mention the lack of characterization or emotional\ndepth. That's not why some stories are told--especially science fiction\nstories--which are usually always plot driven. Still, after the first\ntwenty minutes, which happened to be contain the most engrossing\nmoments in the film, I found myself wondering if this story would wind\nup as some mindless circus film and it wound up being the case.<br><br>The villains were very shallow things, with no motives whatsoever. And\nif science fiction is supposed to be plot driven, then, this film's\nplot could have had more depth. As a matter of fact, this wasn't even a\nscience fiction movie at all, but rather an action movie. And so if the\nvillain is shallow and without motives, chances are, that the hero will\nbe shallow as well. A hero is defined by the degree of the antagonist's\nvillainy after all. And the hero, Major Cage (played brilliantly by Tom\nCruise) was just a soldier in a war, with a gift. His plight was\nsimple. Save the world from evil robotic aliens.<br><br>The action was fun. I bet this looked great in the theaters. I just\nhoped for something more. Something more politically driven,\nconspiratorial, or philosophical. In the end, it's a fairly unique\nstory, with some clever directing and cool action scenes--but that's\nit. I admire the script and the slow dramatic buildup that the time\nloop creates. Each new day that Major Cage experiences led to new\ndiscoveries and new ways for him to defeat his enemy. I may watch this\nagain simply for Tom Cruise's excellent performance--and of course--the\nimpressive fireworks.\n"},

{"review": "\nAfter watching this movie, i remembered last year's Now You See Me,\nwhich was an unexpected and entertaining movie.<br><br>This is very well paced and executed film. Tom Cruise seriously fits\nthe character. I know the main character in the Japanese novel is a\nyoung man, but man i'm glad they cast Tom Cruise in this. I'm not a fan\nof Tom but to me he always give 120% in every film. If Hollywood wanted\nit to follow the original material, they would cast some pretty face\nteenagers that would have the same personality as the rest typical\nteenagers characters (Stupid, ignorant, selfish, arrogant for no\nreason). Thank God they didn't do that.<br><br>The story is excellent and it is nowhere similar to Groundhog Day\nexcept for the day loops. it is action packed and there are plenty of\nfunny moments. You may expect the looping days would be boring after a\nwhile, but you'd be wrong.<br><br>I cannot comment on the CGI, because i think there is too much good CGI\nin every movies nowadays that i am not impressed anymore. But it does\nnot mean the CGI int he movie is bad or anything. On the contrary it\nfelt pretty real to me.<br><br>My recommendation : GO SEE THIS MOVIE. You will not regret it.<br><br>P/S : The only bad experience when i was watching this movie in cinema\nwas the guy beside me who constantly open his brightly lit phone and\neven answered a call. another is a group of stupid teenagers behind me\nwho keep commenting loudly on every scene, thinking they were funny.

{"review": "\nSo Tom Cruise has been back again with the latest sci-fi, Edge of\nTomorrow. After his great performance in Oblivion, he made it again in\nthis comedy-filled tasty Twinkie. Not to say this film is all\ncomedy,and there was too much action to categorize it as nice drama\nmovie. What I was going to say is, this movie has all the movie needs\nto be enjoyable.<br><br>Private Cage is brought down to warfare against aliens, without reading\n\"Exoskeleton Suit for Dummies\" first. But oh my, he had this curse that\nPhil had in Punxsutawney that he had to die and respawn, and over and\nover and (over) again that he granted from an alien he killed.<br><br>I don't know, but apparently, the screenwriter was inspired by\n\"Groundhog Day\", which is a good thing. The pace really done well by\ndescribing Cage deals with time-loop. There are many possibilities of a\nman's mind could think to take advantage of a powerful curse, and I\nthink they explore this well, just like Groundhog Day.<br><br>Good thing comes from the characters. They are lovable and some of them\nhave great quotes. Emily Blunt really nailed the character of a\nhard-soldier that shared same fate with Cage in the past. She really\nbalanced Tom Cruise's performance.<br><br>But enough exaggerating, shall I? There are minus-es too. Always. The\nfirst one is the lack of pre-invasion imaging of Earth(I am not really\nsure for this one, because I missed first five minutes of the movie).\nDamn, they should have made the detail about the mimic's purpose and\nmaybe, a little twist in the credits that could open a gate for sequels\n(duh!). The second, well, I think there is no second minus.<br><br>Even it is not perfect, I believe they have exceeded the edge of making\na sci-fi well-balanced, either from the storyline and action. Really\nworth to watch in cinema. And btw, forget Godzilla, the storyline\nsucks.(no h8 kaiju fans)\n"},
{"review": "\nTake the 1993 classic Bill Murray flick and make the short furry guy\nthe star minus the comedy and include lots of guns and you have Edge of\nTomorrow. Interesting in theory except it completely throws the entire\nconcept of linear time out the window with the 2nd or 3rd revival.

{"review": "\nEdge of Tomorrow is a science fiction film starring Tom Cruise and\nEmily Blunt. It had a very clever plot and well-paced action scenes.\nWhat intrigued me about it was that it is based on a Japanese graphic\nnovel (or manga) called \"All You Need Is Kill\".<br><br>The story is about an army officer named William Cage (Tom Cruise) who\ngets caught up in fighting a war against an elite alien race along side\nSpecial Forces soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt). Shortly after dying\nthe first time he is dropped into combat, he discovers that he is stuck\nin a time loop which repeats the same scenario over and over. Realising\nthey can use this to their advantage, Cage and Vrataski hone their\nbattle skills each time the loop occurs and hatch a plan to kill the\naliens and win the war.<br><br>This concept was very cleverly executed. It was like Aliens meets\nStarship Troopers meets Groundhog Day. When the movie wanted to be\nfunny with jokes about deja vu, it was hilarious.

{"review": "\nTo me this film was surprisingly enough, actually funnier than Cruises\nlast comedy, Knight &amp; Day.

The only\nfilm I've ever seen in which the 3D actually did add something extra\nspecial to the film, was Avatar. Personally I think the 3D fad can\nmostly be chalked up as another Hollywood gimmick that really does\nnothing at all, except add extra cost to tickets, and extra in their\npockets of course. This film itself however is not a gimmick, it's\nsolid action sci-fi that even does have some real thought provoking\nmoments. The writing here is good, far better than most Hollywood\naction films.

It's fair to say that the writers behind this one\nmined both films for inspiration and came up with a watchable, if\nlight, concoction.<br><br>The problem with EDGE OF TOMORROW really is its familiarity, but saying\nthat, it still works as a worthwhile Hollywood blockbuster.

I\nstill think Emily Blunt keeps getting miscast in action-orientated\nroles, but she's acceptable here, and the supporting cast includes\nwelcome turns from Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson, and the like.

This\nis one big budget sci-fi movie that's very well done for the most part.\nThe basic plot isn't completely original - you'll see some small\ntouches of \"Groundhog Day\" here and there - but it is handled with\nintelligence. The character played by Tom Cruise (who I must admit is\ngood in this role) may be a coward (at first), but he's not stupid - he\nsoon catches on to what's happening and does what you'd probably do in\nthe same position. You'll probably guess what happens at the end before\nit actually happens, but all the same you won't feel your intelligence\nis insulted. As a bonus, the action sequences are also well handled,\nbeing very exciting while having the feeling things may not go\naccording to anyone's plan. If I have a complaint about the movie, it's\nthat some of the special effects - mainly the depiction of the aliens -\ndon't quite convince, coming across as obvious CGI creations.

{"review": "\nThis is a welcome return to big budget form for Doug Liman after\nstumbling with the mess that was Jumper.

In\nan era of filmmaking where most effects sequences are pre- visualized\nto an almost sterilizing degree, the action filmed feels remarkably\nspontaneous - thanks to Liman's chaotic, figure it out on set style of\nfilmmaking, that has been aptly named 'Limania.'<br><br>As Cruise gets caught in this time loop where he repeats the same day\nover and over, the script fleshes this scenario out where it never\nfeels repetitive or predictable. A concept like this is prime for\nwriting itself into a corner and forcing a last act to resolve\neverything, but Edge of Tomorrow avoids such last act problems. A minor\ngripe with the script would be that no one recognizes Cage as an\nofficer, yet he is a prominent media figure that got millions of\nrecruits to join the fight. That aside, Edge of Tomorrow is a hell of a\nlot of fun.\n"},

It was interesting to watch the character develop (as if he\nreally had a choice), the skills he needed to fight the summers alien\nenemy. There was a surprising amount of humor in the movie &amp; it is easy\nto see where they could have made subtle changes to the script &amp; just\nmade it a lot darker, but they wisely remembered that it is supposed to\nbe a fun summer alien movie &amp; people don't really care for depression\nwith their sci-fi.

Probably because we don't really know what Cage\n(Again, not Nic, nice try) cares about, we don't see him care about\nanything, except wining the war (maybe at some point we feel that he\nloves Rita, but it was not very well developed, things happened a\nlittle bit rush in emotional development). <br><br>As a male audience, I wasn't stunned but still completely satisfied,\nmaybe I just care about the plot and action more than the emotion (Just\nlike Liman's first Bourne, emotional development was lacking while the\nplot and action are stunning).

{"review": "\nThere are so many sci-fi movies nowadays, all trying to make a\ndifference in a really chaotic genre. Well, the difference from now on\nhas a name and it's called ''Edge of Tomorrow''. The innovative script\nis combining hardcore sci-fi with groundhog's day plot. After\nconsidering as a deserter, Cage (Tom Cruise), is poured in the ongoing\nbattle with aliens. The battle against aliens goes wrong, but after his\ndeath, he notices that he's living the same day again and again.\nGroundhog day. The script is brilliantly clever and this makes Doug's\nLiman job an easy task. The director is constructing the film like a\nvideo game. Every time you lose, you have a new try to achieve game's\npurpose. The whole movie is reminding a video game with its spectacular\nmeaning. You can follow the hero searching every possible aspect,\nchanging the smallest detail, just to reach his goal and win this\nbattle. Additionally, the sci-fi element is magnificent. Aliens are\nmimics which look like fast android transformers. On the other hand,\nhumans have super robotic suits in order to fight these expeditious and\npowerful creatures. What else do you want? I repeat, in the whole\nmovie, you feel like you're watching a video game, processing stage by\nstage. Only a few movies have done something similar successfully.\nAlso, the plot is so intriguing that retains the suspense until the\nlast minute. Not only the director is doing a great job, but the cast\nis similarly pretty qualitative. Tom Cruise never gets old giving one\nmore absolute action performance. But the biggest surprise is called\nEmily Blunt, who is delightful in each appearance and we expect\nglorious things from her in the future. So if you love sci-fi and\nespecially if you enjoy video games you should definitely watch Edge of\nTomorrow, but the fact is that this movie is far more interesting than\nanyone would believe, thus it's a must-watch.\n"},

It may be possible if we\nconsider the 'many world's' theory, but again, the film at no time\nsuggests this. It incorporates elements of other films you may have\nseen, like 'groundhog day' or 'predestination' etc, but for a loop to\nbe created that makes a mockery of time continuum, then the 'other\nworld's' theory must be included as part of the dialog.

{"review": "\nEdge of Tomorrow (2014): Dir: Doug Liman / Cast: Tom Cruise, Emily\nBlunt, Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleesan, Noah Taylor: Scientific version of\nGroundhog Day that dabbles on the issue of fate. Set in the future,\naliens have waged war and Tom Cruise plays Major William Cage who\nrefuses to be placed on the battle ground. This has him knocked out and\nforced into the middle of mayhem. He initially dies in battle yet he\nawakens repeatedly in the same place and repeats the same day until he\ngets it right. The goal is to destroy the alpha male but they always\nanticipate their arrival. Cage seeks out a freedom fighter, played by\nEmily Blunt and together they repeatedly try to figure out how to win\nthis war. Humor occurs when she trains him and he constantly gets\ninjured thus resulting in her shooting him and setting him starting all\nover again. Other roles include Bill Paxton as a gruff no nonsense\nSergeant, and Brendan Gleeson as a cynical General who initially forces\nthis position on Cage. Noah Taylor steals moments as a former\ngovernment scientist whom Blunt has recruited to help figure out the\nkey to destroy this alien race. Once Cage comes into play they progress\nforward but not without difficulty. Directed by Doug Liman who\npreviously made Go and the overrated The Bourne Identity. The\nscreenplay is inventive despite constant repetition. Cruise and Blunt\nhave great chemistry and the special effects are explosive with aliens\nthat seem unstoppable. Groundhog Day was more theme oriented while\nLiman's film goes for pure entertainment action that should place\nviewers at the edge of their seat. Score: 8 / 10\n"},

{"review": "\nEdge of Tomorrow is one of the most brilliant, original sci-fi films to\ngrace the big screen in recent years. Of course, it carries an infinite\nload of action sequences, but this is also a character story that\ninfuses sci-fi themes like time travel in a way. The film is\nessentially a louder, sci-fi version of Groundhog Day. The film is not\nonly fun, but it is also brainy which is hard to see in a sci-fi film\nnowadays. The film should have been seen by more people, because it's\njust that good. <br><br>Doug Liman's film is about a global war that is ongoing between the\nhumans and these aliens. Major William Cage is sent into battle despite\nhaving no combat training.

Along with the help of one of\nthe world's best soldiers, Rita, Cage must relive the day over and over\nagain until he can defeat the aliens. <br><br>The film has great acting. Tom Cruise is getting older, but he still\ncan hold an action film on his own. There are no death-defying stunts\nhere, but I feel that Cruise once again does a really good job. He is\nequally matched by the gorgeous Emily Blunt. I don't associate her with\naction movies, but this movie may have changed my mind. I also liked\nBill Paxton as one of the army leaders.

I just\ncan't side with Hollywood replacing Japanese characters with bankable\nnames like Cruise and Cage should be Keiji and played by a Japanese\nactor. But I'm going to let this stuff pass. Emily Blunt was tough as\nnails - and that's been a hard sell for Hollywood. Tough women - Linda\nHamilton tough - haven't been handled well by the studios and that's\nnot saying the women aren't out there. Blunt pulls off the famous red\nwarrior with ease.

{"review": "\nDirector Doug Liman's \"Edge of Tomorrow\" is \"Groundhog Day\" on steroids\nwith some mean looking aliens. The movie stars Tom Cruise as Lt.\nColonel Cage, who is sent into battle against mimic aliens who have\ndestroyed much of the world.

Cage is scared out of wits, but then something\nmiraculous happens; he dies in battle, and then relives the same day\nrepeatedly. Why that happens? Let me not spoil if for you, but let's\nsay that he became a blood brother of the Omega alien mimic fraternity;\nthey have that? The stunning Emily Blunt co-stars as Rita, a fierce\nwarrior who was pivotal in destroying many of these mimic aliens in a\npast war. Cage groundhogs into Rita's world and the two team to destroy\nthe Omega mimic plan to destroy mankind. The first two acts of \"Edge of\nTomorrow\" kept me on the edge of my seat with its inventiveness in a\nfuturistic action movie. However, the third act of \"mimic aliens vs.\nhuman soldiers\" action unfortunately mimicked many other formulaic\nbattle-oriented action flicks.

I\nwas skeptical that the film might come off as repetitive but Cruise's\nchanging reaction to the same situations coupled with the slight\nchanges in scenery and outcome keep the film feeling new and engaging\nthe whole way through.<br><br>Would recommend\n"},
{"review": "\nGround Hog Day meets Aliens meets Oblivion....takes great elements from\neach and adds others to make a great movie. I love all 3 movies, and\nthis one absolutely does not disappoint. It reminds me of a video game\nin which you die and come back with memories of what led up to the last\nencounter before you died and you learn from it. One might think it\nwould appeal only to video gamer-aged mentalities....maybe it might,\nbut I loved this movie. This movie is clean and well produced. Special\neffects are great. Nothing is too far over the top. Well-balanced.\nCharacters are as well developed as necessary without drowning...the\naction and plot are fast-paced. This movie does not pander.\n"},
{"review": "\nI usually think sci-fi movies have too many plot holes, and this one\nhas some, but for the most part it makes sense. Of course, they are\nusing the plot of groundhog day set in an alien invasion. One big plot\nhole is why didn't Rita leave herself notes so she wouldn't have to\nrepeatedly meet Cage over and over. And the whole part where she and\nthe scientist dude figured out some aliens are Alpha protecting an\nentity called Omega, was very far fetching. But anyway it was cool to\nsee how Cage improved day to day to get further on the battlefield.\nConsidering we are talking about invading aliens, why did others, like\nthe general, find it so hard to believe Cage and Rita about time\ntravel.<br><br>Anyway, it ended how it should with Cage waking up again except this\ntime, things are different.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good sci-fi with cool special effects. Definitely\none of Cruise's better films in the past 10 years.\n"},
{"review": "\nBest Sci-Fi of the year. Great Performances. One to not miss. ...\nRecommend to any one that likes Sci-Fi movies.<br><br>Edge of Tomorrow kick ass from start to finish. What a roller-coaster\nride! This will be hard to top in the upcoming summer season. There is\nnothing wrong with this film. It's got everything.<br><br>Overall I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes Sci-Fi,\naction, or anyone who wants to watch a good film that you will have fun\nwith. It's highly enjoyable, well done, and easily accessible. It's\nexactly what a big budget Hollywood movie should be.<br><br>I highly recommend it!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis century, evidently thanks to advanced digital technology, has seen\ndozens of futuristic movies where the world is to be saved from alien\ninvasion. Most of them have both the plain plot and ending, and all\naction in focused on visual effects. The latter plays also an important\nrole in Edge of Tomorrow, but, fortunately, a new angle - in the form\non recurrent time loop - and twisted humor make this movie an\nentertainment distinct from other of the kind, perhaps as the\nscreenplay is adapted from a Japanese light novel. The very ending has\na pleasant \"dodge\" as well.<br><br>Anyway, you have to concentrate and ponder, as things get intertwined,\nrepeated scenes are combined with new elements, and the chemistry\nbetween Tom Cruise as Major William Cage and Emily Blunt as Sergeant\nRita Vrataski is good as well; besides, Bill Paxton as Master Sergeant\nFarell and Brendan Gleeson as General Brigham provide small, yet\nmemorable performances. As for the effects, the enemy's look is\ndifferent, and the likeness of the equipment/technology used by the\n\"good guys\" with the ones used in related movies is not annoying as\nthey are not means for torpid destruction. The creators have taken all\nwith ease, sometimes it seems that they laugh even at themselves.\n"},
{"review": "\nLittle Spoiler<br><br>Very good and efficient movie. I loved the first part. The discover of\npower, the use of them, the ability to improve himself. Tom cruise,\ngood actor here, play the role of a video game character where you\ncould save just before attacking a big boss. I recommend it a lot. It\nis the only film I know which mix the temporal loop and war. I still\ndon't know how very good villains (which look like Matrix creatures)\nare able not to strengthen the protection of the most important thing\nthey have ! (like Death Star in Star Wars). Just for this It put 9/10.\nBut It is close to a 10.<br><br>Don't hesitate !\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is the Best movie I have seen in years, and I watch a lot of\nmovies. Groundhog day and Independence day have a baby and you get\nthis.. Plus adding Tom Cruise and Bill Paxton to the mix is the icing\non the cake. The beginning of the movie is a tad confusing, but you\ncatch on very quickly. Within about 10 minutes you are hooked on this\nmovie and know you have a gem on your hands. Its rare when you don't\nwant a movie to end, but this was the case with this movie. I hope they\nmake a sequel , it deserves it. Bill Paxton is hilarious and reminds me\nof his character Chet on weird science, and Tom Cruise is a great actor\njust like in all his other movies. So if you watch this make sure you\nsit down, and don't plan on getting up for anything.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was fully prepared to be frustrated with wasted time during the\nrepeats in this movie given the premise. I have to admit, though, it\nwas handled well. <br><br>Tom Cruise was cast perfectly at the beginning of the movie as the\nsoft, bureaucratic military officer and his growth into a hardened\nsoldier was realistic and well-acted. <br><br>With apologies to Keira Knightley, Emily Blunt may be the most\nbeautiful woman in Hollywood sans makeup. She was rarely portrayed as\nvulnerable in the movie, and that was a nice refresher from the\nstandard woman-in-power's perceived weakness.<br><br>Bill Paxton brings the score down in this movie, as he remains one of\nthe worst actors in show biz in my opinion.\n"},

{"review": "\nI'v got to like Tom Cruise in sci-fi movies lately which I wouldn't\nhave said ten years ago' the thing about this movie is the humour for\nme' every time he dies I just found it so funny for some reason. The\nmovie is based on an alien invasion on earth and cruise plays major\nCage who is trying to sell the war to the public and is thrown into the\nlions den by his commanding officer (played by brendan gleeson' who\ntakes an instant dislike to cage) where he comes across a platoon of\nsoldiers and their commanding officer (bill Paxton) where he quickly\nfinds out that the war is basically a slaughter and he has to relive\nthe nightmare time after time against an enemy that knows their every\nmove, step in' Rita Vrstaski (Emily blunt) who is the poster girl\nspecial forces hero, and gives cage some startling news that he's\ntotally unprepared for. this is one of the best sci-fi movies Iv'e seen\nfor a long time carried of by Cruise and blunt very well' the ending is\na bit predictable but there's enough going on in the rest of the movie\nto keep us all entertained for a couple of hours.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm not especially a fan of Tom Cruise and even less a fan of science\nfiction. But this film rocks.

{"review": "\nI really do respect Tom Cruise a lot as an actor because of the amount\nof hardwork he puts into his films,but, had not enjoyed any of his\nprevious ventures post MI4. To add to that I'm not a fan of Sci-Fi\ncinema. Despite that, I braved to watch this movie, as I had heard rave\nreviews about it, and boy, it was a treat!!<br><br>Europe is attacked by an ET species and their only hope is an officer\nwith absolutely no prior experience in combat,who is stuck in a time\nloop,after accidentally killing one of the aliens and having it's blood\ntransfused. Even though,dying repeatedly and going back in time to go\nthrough the same routine,like in Groundhog Day, seemed to be\npredictable and I expected to get bored. But, every time , Cruise\npresented his character in a different fashion and was able to emote\nalmost all the feelings a human possibly can with ease. His comic\ntiming was right on the money. <br><br>Director Doug Liman did a great job behind the camera. The story was\ninnovative and almost all the loose ends were tied by the time the film\nended.The special effects and BG score were good. Of the cast, Emily\nBlunt was brilliant; so was Bill Paxton.

{"review": "\nA Clever, fast-paced action movie with a welcome streak of dark humor.\nThat would be my summary of this movie.<br><br>At first glance, one just can't help it to be skeptical. Another action\nmovie with Tom Cruise. We had some over the last years, and they were\nmediocre at best. The theme of the movie could have well been wasted\nlike we have seen many times before. Fortunately, it was not. <br><br>The trailer promised us a Sci-Fi spectacle, and the movie delivered\njust that.

{"review": "\n\"Edge of Tomorrow\" successfully manages to portray a complex, sci-fi\nstoryline that respects the intellect of the viewer while also\nproviding jam-packed action.

Cruise's drama, humor, and character\ndevelopment keeps the viewer on the edge alongside an excellent dynamic\nwith Emily Blunt. On a side note I appreciated that Blunt used her real\naccent in this film, brings out the seduction in her character...unlike\nher horrendous American accent from \"Looper\". <br><br>To all sci-fans, please be sure watch this movie before it leaves\ntheaters to see Tom Cruise at his absolute best.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Edge of Tomorrow\" is first and foremost an action film. I saw the film\nin IMAX 3-D. It really does present a spectacle.

{"review": "\nEdge of Tomorrow is a fantastic spectacle! While it's been a banner\nyear for great action movies such as Captain America and Days of Future\nPast, this has to be the surprise hit of the summer to date. From start\nto finish, not only does this live up to the trailers, it surpasses\nthem. I really liked this well paced, engaging sci-fi film. <br><br>It's one of those movies where you feel you've seen it before, but just\nnot quite in this way and that's what makes feel fresh and new. Part\nThe Matrix Revolutions, District 9 and a few time travel movies I can't\nquite put my finger on, yet the sum of the parts feels like something\ncompletely unique and wholly entertaining. I think the last time I felt\na movie was such a great mishmash of different movies was Inception.<br><br>This is also vintage Tom Cruise. He commands the screen with his wit,\ncharm and emotion; for me this is his best movie since Mission\nImpossible: Ghost Protocol. If you thought Cruise couldn't carry a\nblockbuster anymore, Exhibit A. Admittedly, what makes this movie work\nwell however is Emily Blunt; she is excellent! Together they had\nsurprisingly great chemistry and are the backbone of the movie. They\nprovided a few genuine, moving moments (always appreciated in an action\nmovie) that elevate the film. <br><br>There's plenty of action, the special effects are solid and there's\nmore than enough humour to balance it all out. Essentially, this movie\nhas all the elements of a great summer blockbuster and is right up\nthere with Days of Future Past as the best of the year to date.

{"review": "\nI just saw this movie, and I was surprised in a good way. I was\nexpecting this to be another okay alien movie, but as I was watching, I\nrealized that this movie was more about the plot and the story, rather\nthan just action and scary scenes. I liked the humor in the movie. One\nof my favorite scenes, was when Cage was doing the push ups and then he\nrolled under the car and got smashed. I found that scene very funny.\nThe battle scenes in this movie were absolutely spectacular. I enjoyed\nwatching all of the humans fight the really cool looking aliens in the\nreally cool suits. Rita was pretty cool with her sword. She took down\nthose aliens like it was the easiest thing in the world. Cage was\npretty funny when he couldn't figure out how to take of the safety.\nThere are only two things that I didn't like about Edge of Tomorrow was\nhow many times that Cage starts the day over in this film. I think they\nwent a little overboard on that one. The movie was the same thing until\nhe gets to the farmhouse. I thought that they could have done a little\nmore with the ending. I won't spoil it. I let you guys think about\nyourselves. There was something else that the director could have done.\nThanks for reading, and think about what you thought should have been\nthe ending.\n"}
