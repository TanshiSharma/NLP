{"review": "\n\nThe Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The\ndepth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering\nexcellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in\nthe\nproduction knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See\nthis film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch\nfor the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the\ncast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and\nremains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is\nexceptional.\nHe brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.<br><br>The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in\nthe theater this night, tears.<br><br>BRAVO!<br><br>\n"},
{"review": "\n\n\"The Green Mile\" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it\nseveral times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was\nconcerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on\nscreen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who\ndid such a magnificent job bringing King's \"Shawshank Redemption\" to the\nscreen.  He does the same high quality work with \"The Green Mile\".  The\nstory is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important\nto the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly\nsuited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to\nsingle out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right\non the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered\nin the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are\ncomplaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film never\ndrags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  The\nlength is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story\nis so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much\nemotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes.\n\"The Green Mile\" will haunt you.  \n"},
{"review": "\n\nFrank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of\nStephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call\nthe green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale\nof the events that transpire at \"the mile\" after the arrival of a giant man,\nJohn Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls.\nActually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.<br><br>A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when\nit comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells,\nthis movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the\nmile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is\neven more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively\nunknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous\nperformances, and the new role is coloured by this.  Doug Hutchison as Percy\nWetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his\ncharacter could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the\nperformance of Michael Duncan.<br><br>It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast\nwonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit\nover three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast\nand the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively\nthrough the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find\nthis movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style,\ncombination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and\nconversation.<br><br>All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and\nsorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the\nyear. Five out of five.\n"},
{"review": "\nHaving seen the movie, The Green Mile, and read the novel of the same \r\nname by Stephen King, I am glad to say that the movie stays true to the \r\nbook, which in itself is a great read.\r\n\r\nI read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the \r\nmovie, I didn't see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left \r\nout. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way \r\ndetract from either work.\r\n\r\nAs far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael \r\nDuncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best \r\nperformances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that \r\nMichael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard \r\nDelacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the \r\nbook.\r\n\r\nI can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the \r\nmovies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had \r\nwritten it.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The \r\nShawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are \r\nboth great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn't a movie about \r\nhope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie \r\nabout a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.\r\n\r\nBut like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4 \r\nstars. Great story, great cast, great look.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie is a real gem.  It is hard to find fault with it.  Hanks is\nexcellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant\ntoward humor.

Michael Clark Duncan put\njust the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and\nsympathetic.<br><br>Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together\nto bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and\ncompelling study of human injustice and charity.\n"},

{"review": "\n\nHaving doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours can\nbe\ndeath to a film).I was so surprised that I didn't look at my watch once\nthroughout the whole movie.

How he made this giant like\ncharacter into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came\ntogether and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long\ntime. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is\nmore known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not\nlong till he's carrying his own movie.

{"review": "\nThe world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men\nare housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the\nplaces are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay.\nHowever, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as\nwell. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but\nare further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case,\nthe realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a\nnatural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer,\nchronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe\nCoffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having\nbeen convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by\nelectrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an\naging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working\non 'Death Row' or \" The Green Mile \", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's\narrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic\nGuards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper),\nHarry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard\ncalled Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his\ndiscovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising\nrevelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven\nKing and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the\nfinest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb\nability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not\nfor the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward,\nthe story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which\ngave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true\nmovie fans. ****\n"},

I had seen\nmany movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not\nmany of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling\nagain.

I have felt the emotions of every\ncharacter. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched\nme like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that\nhasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is\nflawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I\ncan't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the\nleast. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep,\npoignant and heartfelt. The characters are so \"human\" and unpretentious\nyou can't help but adore them.

The\nsupernatural effects in the movie might be unbelievable if you focus\nsolely on them, but I think they're \"metaphoring\" and make things a bit\nmore understandable, maybe. A wonderful movie that moves at a measured\npace on to a very unexpected ending. As with most great movies the\ncasting is almost perfect and each character gives added depth to a\nrich script.

{"review": "\n\nWhether it is fair to compare this film with \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is\na\nquestion up for debate.  However, since there is no decision on that topic\nI\nam going to make the comparison.  \"The Green Mile\" is a long way from \"The\nShawshank Redemption\".  This film deals with a massive death row inmate in\n1935 Louisiana played by Michael Clarke Duncan (in an Oscar nominated\nperformance) who is charged with the murders of two small girls.  It is\nclear from the start that this man is not evil or dangerous at all, in fact\nhe is blessed with the power to heal.  The supernatural aspect of this\nmovie\nturned me off almost immediately.  It seemed that writer-producer-director\nFrank Darabont was going for something between \"The Shawshank Redemption\"\nand one of Stephen King's other novels that dealt with supernatural\nphenomena.  The result is a film that is uneven in many respects, in spite\nof the fact that it is very well made.  Tom Hanks does nothing to help out\nthe problem as he gives his weakest performance in years.  William Sadler\nand Gary Sinise have such little screen time that one barely even notices\nthem.  Everyone else just seems to be along for the ride.  Duncan is the\nrevelation.  He keeps a questionable screenplay above water and holds the\naudience's attention for most of the 3 hours and 7 minutes.  That's another\ndrawback, this film is way too long.  I think that 30 minutes could have\nbeen deleted and the end product would have still been the same.  A very\nconsiderate 4 out of 5 stars.    \n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis is a good film, primarily because of Tom Hanks' subtle ability to\nportray a man who is tough, hard, and duty conscious, and at the same time\ncompassionate and human.

A few scenes are grisly, but the tone\nof the film is generally positive, and several scenes are surprisingly\nmoving. The supernatural powers of one character stood out strangely in a\nfilm that otherwise seemed to be dedicated to harsh reality, but I suspect\nthat was intentional, for contrast, and it worked.<br><br>One detraction was that I had a nagging suspicion that Hollywood was once\nagain taking an opportunity to promote it's sociopolitical views, on capital\npunishment, race, and regionalism, but maybe I have become over-sensitive to\nthis issue.

{"review": "\n\nThe Green Mile caught me by surprise.  Being that The Shawshank Redemption\nis one of my all-time favorite films, I went into this film expecting an\nattempt to capitalize on \"Shawshank\".  Man, was I wrong.  Aside from the\nprison settings, these two films could never be confused with one another. \nWhile Shawshank is about the triumph of the human spirit, The Green Mile is\nmore about who we are at our core.  Are we good or evil?  Can we change who\nwe are?  Why are bad things allowed to happen?  There are some imbedded\nreferences to Christ, even symbolized in John Coffey, where we see the\nsacrifice of His dying for our sins.  The cynics out there may choose to\nsmirk at these actions, but I think that they would be making a knee-jerk\nmistake.  This film makes no judgements about us as a society or any such\nnonsense, but rather tries to make us look at ourselves, individually, and\nhow we relate to the rest of the world.<br><br>Hanks does his best work in a few years.  Michael Duncan and David Morse, I\nthink, are the most compelling, however.  I've heard criticism that the film\nis \"too long,\"  I don't really know how to repond to that argument other\nthan to ask the person if they came to that conclusion before having seen\nthe film.  If a film grabs and interests you, then holds that attention,\nthen there is no way one should be able to make that claim about The Green\nMile.  It is the length it should be and needed to be.  I enjoyed it\nimmensely and will put in in my top ten for the year.<br><br>One last note to the cynics among us:  cynicism does not automatically make\none smart or thoughtful.  In fact, it can be a good thing.  I only say that\nto remind you that just because a film, book, song, or event is about\nsomething \"good\" does not automatically make it bad or\nuntrue.\n"},

Near the end of the movie, Coffey is able to pass on a\nmemory/image of the person who actually committed the crime he was convicted\nof to the guard/narrator (Tom Hanks).  Although Coffey is clearly innocent,\nwe are told that nothing can be done to save him.  This is totally absurd. \nIn the real world, where there is no evidence for actual spiritual or\npsychic healing, practicianers (or charlatans) enjoy fantastic success.  If\nthere were a REAL healer, who could also transfer images from the minds of\nkillers to other people, then publicizing his talent would be a trivial\nexercise.  We already know that officials came to the prison to see a mouse\nperform -- why wouldn't people come to see a genuine healer?

For Duncan the decision was probably more difficult, he\ngot to play the usual part of the black country guy.

{"review": "\n\n1994 saw a modest Stephen King novel translated into a modest, little-seen\nprison drama...that is, until it was blessed with a surprising seven Academy\nAward nominations, including Best Picture. Since then, everyone and their\ngrandfather has espoused \"The Shawshank Redemption\" as the little movie that\ncould...and did. Five years later, its director, Frank Darabont, has adapted\nyet another prison-based King tale into a highly pleasing entertainment. But\nthere the similarities end. While \"Shawshank Redemption\" essentially belied\nits typically macabre Kingian origins, but for a similar tone and languid\npace \"The Green Mile\" includes a crucial plot element not atypical from the\nhorror-meister's oeuvre. Told in flashback, a former death-row prison guard\n(solidly played by Hanks) relates the extraordinary story of John Coffey\n(Duncan), a simple-minded and gentle inmate who is readily accepted as a\nkiller in the summer of 1935 because of his hulking size and damning\ncircumstantial evidence. But Coffey (initials J.C., ahem), in addition to\nhis overwhelmingly considerate attitude, possesses a singular talent for\npsychic empathy with others and an ability to heal the sick. Gradually, he\nconvinces most of his captors, to varying degrees, that he is not a man\ncapable of the heinous crime he is condemned to die for imminently.\nCompounding their crisis of conscience are the presence of a callous fellow\nguard and a psychotic neighboring inmate. Despite its over-length (by at\nleast 20 minutes), the 3-hour \"Green Mile\" succeeds in every other respect.\nOften moving and technically astute, its premiere quality lies within its\nensemble of actors, each of whom is simply perfect in their respective\nroles. Hanks may be the star of the show, and Duncan may stand out because\nof the uniqueness of his character, but their co-stars are consistently\nequal to the standard they've both set throughout. That alone is reason\nenough to see \"The Green Mile\".\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI agree with some of the other comments made about Stephen Kings\nadaptations, some work and some definately don't. This is one of those that\nfortunatley does, and it even makes up for some of the one's that\ndon't.\nDon't mistake this for just another prison flick, or expect a rip off of the\nShawshank Redemption, because this is neither.\nIt follows the lives of prisoners and guards on a prisons death row, Hanks\n(Paul Edgecombe) is the head guard who tries to show a little compassion to\nthe prisoners facing the inevitable, most of his fellow guards are of the\nsame mind except one, who uses his position as nephew of the governor's wife\nto keep him in a job that enables him to induldge his bullying\nnature.\nMichael Clarke Duncan is John Coffey, who, with shades of Forrest Gump,\nintroduces himself as John Coffey, \"like the drink only spelled different\"\nis a prisoner on death row for killing two girls, as the film progresses the\nguards come to realise they are about to send an innocent man to the\nchair.\nIt has some nice moments in it, particularly with Mr Jingles, a mouse who\npatrols the 'Green Mile' floor and eventually makes friends with the guards\nand prisoners, and I have to say I haven't seen an acting performance like\nthis from a mouse since Tom and Jerry.\nAll the cast play their parts well, Tom Hanks and Michael Clark Duncan\nespecially.\nKing's story gives the film enough of a twist to make it interesting and\ndifferent, but it's not so over the top with the effects and to make it\nnonsensical.\nThe film wasn't quite what I expected, and was pleasantly better than I\nthough it was going to be.\nIt maybe a 3 hour epic but I've seen shorter films that have seemed twice as\nlong, and I could quite happily sit through the film without getting\nantsy.\nOn a par with 'Shawshank' so if you liked that chances are you'll like this\nas well.\n\n"}
