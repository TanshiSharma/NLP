{"review": "\nBlack Mass serves as a nice redemption for the floundering career of\nJohnny Depp, who has leaned more on quirky voices and loud makeup than\nhis actual skills in recent years. His portrayal of mob boss Whitey\nBulger is a powerhouse performance and easily his best since he first\nintroduced the world to Jack Sparrow. It's too bad the movie as a whole\ndoesn't fair quite as well. Despite a great cast and some interestingly\ninsane source material, somehow a movie about one of America's most\ninfamous criminals feels more like small claims court. Director Cooper\nfocuses his narrative on Bulger's less-than-legal partnership with the\nFBI. It's a fascinatingly close-knit community we witness (agents,\nfelons, politicians, and families alike) in which loyalty and\ncorruption go hand-in-hand. It's a grimy yet quiet 70's-feel gangster\nfilm that engages its audience nearly as much as it reminds them of\nbetter films. Therein lies its big problem: What is Black Mass offering\nthat hasn't already been perfected in other gangster films?\nUnfortunately, instead of a true movie-making vision, it's like a guy\nwatched every crime drama from the last 40 years and just spit out a\nless-interesting copycat. Not that a counterfeit of something great\ncan't still have its positives: the score is beautiful and the\nperformances from the top-notch cast around Depp are nearly as superb\nas his, all of whom nail the oft-parodied Bostonian accent with aplomb.\nBut with too many side plots to juggle, not enough cohesion to the\nstorytelling, and an unfortunate lack of auteur vision, Black Mass just\ncan't stand against the great American crime films of yore (Chinatown,\nGodfather, Goodfellas).\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you like slow, plodding movies full of unlikeable characters, by all\nmeans gear up for this sleep inducing film. Goodfellas is an action\nmovie compared to Black Mass.<br><br>There are a few good qualities here: top shelf production, excellent\nacting, a clear, concise story of characters making poor choices -\nleading to predictable consequences.<br><br>But who cares? There's no entertainment here! None of these characters\nare worth giving a damn about, and the few sporadic scenes that offer\nany true value sit like islands on a still horizonless sea.<br><br>But I learned something... Really? This might be the number one reason\nto sit through this boring expanse, and the info is not worth it. The\nscumbags are scumbags, the protagonist is a weak, shallow excuse for a\nlaw enforcer, and the other surrounding characters are bland at best\n(including Benedict, who for all his talent, brings nothing of note to\nan already white bread affair). Speaking of white bread - No culture\nwhat-so-ever, and often these fat, out of shape gangsters look absurd\nin their early 80's sunglasses and attire. There will be no awards\ngiven for costuming or make-up here. True Depp is transformed with\nprosthetics, but as a friend and I joked - his character is far\nexceeded by the likes of Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder.<br><br>If you've seen the trailer, you've been robbed of one of the films\nthree or four memorable moments. Interestingly, all of these good\nscenes are just spice to the meat of the film. This is not a good\nthing! When the main arc is dull, the violence (while realistic) lacks\nstylistic punctuation, and the constant voice overs are delivered with\napathy... one wonders what the hell the director was thinking!<br><br>Waste of time, even for fans of actors involved.<br><br>my score? a disappointingly average 5 out of 10.\n"},
{"review": "\nI swear to God I really really wanted to like this movie. I am kind of\na fan of Bulger's for some sick reason and I felt like Johnny Depp was\nappropriately menacing and weird looking and did a good job with making\nthe Violence believable. What failed was the writing. There is never\nreally any attention paid to why Whitey was Whitey or how he got to be\nWhitey or why he wanted to be Whitey. His kid is dead his marriage\nruined and he is just accumulating money to accumulate money? Why? He\napparently has no vices to speak of except giving money to con men from\nthe IRA. The whole thing just makes no sense. The whole thing just\nseemed apathetic.It could have been a real classic but they fornicated\nwith the puppy yet again. It was just Depp looking weird and enjoying a\nWHitey Halloween costume while he strangled hookers and killed\ninformants. Thanks Hollywood. I suspect you can blame the producers.\n"},
{"review": "\nBlack Mass is a crime drama movie revolving around the true events\nbehind the Winter Hill Gang and the gang's leader Whitey Bulger played\nby Johnny Depp. The premise for the film was very interesting as it\nplayed on Whitey Bulger's connections as his brother, William Bulger,\nplayed by Benedict Cummberbatch is a Massachusetts State Senator while\none of his childhood friends John Connolly played by Joel Edgerton is\nan FBI agent. This an amazing premise however it was not fully executed\nas it focused mainly on Joel Edgerton's character and Cummberbatch's\ncharacter felt out of place at times. This may have been a more\nrealistic approach however I felt like they could have utilized\nCummberbatch's character more in the film as it would have added two\nassets for Whitey. The Film is divided in three parts overlooking\nWhitey's almost twenty year reign. However because of this approach it\nleaves viewers wondering what happened in that time frame and feels as\nif it was forced to make the movie feel more like the actually events,\nso spread out. The cinematography and direction of the film is very\ncrisp and sleek which makes the film a lot more enjoyable. The acting\nall together throughout the film is superb as it holds a stellar cast.\nI found Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton,Kevin Bacon and Benedict\nCummberbatch to be all great. Depp's performance was electrifying and\nhe should get an Oscar nod but I would not be surprised if he does not\nget one.<br><br>Overall decent film<br><br>7/10\n"},
{"review": "\nEncompassed with episodic rhythm and an awfully conventional format,\nScott Cooper mutates a story of rich soil capable of greatness to a\ndetaching and routine crime film. Black Mass grasps only on the\nsuperficial layer as it focuses solely on documented events of the\ncrime they organized. Due to this, the movie suffers as it seems to be\nmerely a biography- laying out these horrific events in these specified\ntimeframes but not putting any focus on the characters that performed\nit. All action, but none of the story that happens between that allows\nthe audience to view who they are and what they're like. Black Mass\nfails to delve deeper into the roots, and this of course limits the\nscope of all the actors. Great mob cinematography such as The\nGodfather, Goodfellas, and the Sopranos- all of these were so great\nbecause they allowed the audience to see what the characters were like\nwhen they weren't shooting, beating, or plotting against people.<br><br>That being said, in their limited boxes boy do these actors put on a\nshow. Led by Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, the audience can tell\nstraight from the start that this cast reveled and lived their roles.\nWith the amount of overwhelming, heinous events; the film had to have\nsomeone cold-hearted and sleazy, and woah did these actors become the\nepitome of that. However, due to this heavily limited character, the\nonly \"rise\" the audience feels are from the bone-chilling actions that\nthese men did. Black Mass fails to captivate. And when the closing\ncredits roll a feeling of disappointment washes over you, as it feels\nlike you just watched an episode on the ID channel with really, really\ngood actors.\n"},
{"review": "\nI don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled to inform others\nabout how awful this film was. And I want to prefice this by saying I\nlove crime films and have seen the greats such as Goodfellas, the\nGodfather, and The Departed but this was just drivel. <br><br>Let's start with the acting: Johnny Depp plays Boston crime lord James\n\"Whitey\" Bulger and reveals virtually nothing about the character he\nplays aside from the violent actions he portrays. The supporting cast\ndoes nothing to make this a compelling story either with the exception\nof Joel Edgerton's John Connolly as a street-wise kid turned FBI agent\nloyal to Bulger's cause. <br><br>The pacing and dialogue are also the biggest culprits here. The film\ndevelops slowly leaving the watcher wondering if it will ever pick up\nto an emotional crescendo with only to find out the ride is as\nmonotonous as your daily drive. Moreover, the dialogue feels like\nstudents taking turns reading out of a textbook. I know that the film\nis a biographic one but there's no need to have it feel as though\nyou're reading a Wikipedia article. <br><br>Likewise, the musical score tries to underpin the uneasy feel of the\nmovie but only works to put the viewer to sleep with its two tone rise\nand fall. None of the cinematography and shots of the scenes work to\ncreate anything worth capturing attention. There are shots of Southie\nthat do convey the bleak outlook of Bulger's turf but they are few and\nfar between as the film mostly focuses on the boring and uninspired\ndialogue and setting the actors are captured in such as living rooms,\noffices, dark bars, and car interiors. <br><br>If I was to summarize watching this film with an analogy I would\ndescribe it as eating and tasting a cardboard box.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this movie with a bunch of my college friends (we are all in\ncollege). They all loved it. And I will say that Johnny Depp and Joel\nEdgerton were fantastic in this movie, however, the movie lacked the\nqualities of a great mob movie. I have always been fascinated by the\nmob genre. I have watched the sopranos, goodfellas, donnie brasco, the\ngodfather, and basically all mob movies under the sun. I feel like\nJohnny Depp and Edgerton are great at portraying their characters, but\nI feel like no other character was developed at all. Benedict\nCumberbatch is one of the great actors of today, but Cooper just wasted\nhis talents on a weak supporting role.<br><br>I was also looking forward to see the inner workings of how Whitey\nBulger came to power. I understand that he was a silent, cold-blooded\nmobster that used the FBI to become to be one of the most influential\ncriminals in Boston. However, other then a few choking scenes and\nmurder scenes, I would have liked Cooper to show more of the specifics\nof Bulger's rise to power. Also, we rarely see Bulger interacting in\nthe everyday mob-life, but we always see how he handles unique,\nproblematic situations all-the time. I would have liked to have seen\none normal day in Whitey Bulger's life given the movie was only was 2\nhours long. <br><br>Overall, a decent movie with great acting by Depp and Edgerton, but\nlacking on some of the finer details of a classic mob movie. <br><br>P.S. I could not take Ben Wyatt serious in that mustache.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe icy blue eyes of notorious Boston crime boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger\nstare out from the screen in Scott Cooper's \"Black Mass\" like the gaze\nof some confident jungle predator calmly lying in wait, holding his\nground until the moment he moves in for the kill. And that same coolly\ncalculated composure extends to every aspect of how the actor playing\nBulger embodies the role, or rather disappears into it. But if Johnny\nDepp's mesmerizing performance \u0097 a bracing return to form for the star\nafter a series of critical and commercial misfires \u0097 is the chief\nselling point of \"Black Mass,\" there is much else to recommend this\nsober, sprawling, deeply engrossing evocation of Bulger's South Boston\nfiefdom and his complex relationship with the FBI agent John Connolly,\nplayed with equally impressive skill by Joel Edgerton. Something of an\nanti-\"The Departed\" (which was partly inspired by the Bulger case), the\nmovie has an intentionally muted, '70s-style look and feel that may\nlimit its appeal to the date-night multiplex crowd, but quality-\nstarved adult moviegoers should flock to one of the fall's first\nserious, awards-caliber attractions. Not only that but Benedict\nCumberbatch (who plays as a Senator and as Whitey's brother) has given\na stellar performance. He is truly a talented person who gives his all\nin every film/show he acts.<br><br>BOTTOM LINE: Johnny Depp deserves an Oscar, if not then at least a\nnomination. Truly worth watching\n"},

This is the type of the film that makes you want more and\nmore after each scene is done all the way towards the end, and the\nsupporting characters really help Black Mass reach its full potential\nof hitting the right spots for a moviegoer. Scott Cooper did an amazing\njob in this biopic he also she be up for best director, Joel Edgerton\nsteals the spotlight in some scenes and bloody nails it in all the\nscreen time he gets.

{"review": "\nThe American crime genre is arguably the cornerstone of modern cinema.\nThink cinematic masterpieces and there's a good chance every third one\nis a mobster flick or underworld yarn. This breed of film is nothing if\nnot reliable. Why, then, is the first notable movie about one of\nU.S.A's most notorious and durable heads of crime so unmemorable?\nChecking off key points in an organised but uninspired manner, this\nJames \"Whitey\" Bulger biopic is seemingly more concerned about fitting\nin all the Wiki-worthy moments rather than truly delving into the\npsyche of a monstrous man. The unfocused script stems from the choice\nto trace two decades of Bulger's life (1975 to 1995), an unwieldy\nstretch of time that results in an unclear filmic timeline and the\nrequirement for truly horrible makeup and wigs. Johnny Depp has\nsucceeded at portraying a gangster before \u0096 his John Dillinger in\nPublic Enemies is enthralling \u0096 however he's lumped with too many\npoorly executed physical alterations and character development\nshortcomings to make an impression here.

All of the \"plot-twists\" that were\nsupposed to feel surprising didn't feel very surprising. It was\ncompletely obvious when something bad was going to happen to someone,\nunlike other gang movies like Goodfellas or Godfather. <br><br>If your not too picky and want to watch some decent gang action and\ndrama then you will likely enjoy this movie, but if your a movie snob\nlike me I would recommend passing on this one.\n"},

{"review": "\nI really don't know a whole lot about James \"Whitey\" Bulger outside of\nwhat I got in the documentary about him that came out shortly before\nthis film. Needless to say, he was quite an unsavory character, but\ninteresting movies have been made about those types, even in the\ngangster genre. BLACK MASS didn't always work as an engaging story,\ndespite combining two of my biggest interests (gangsters and true\ncrime), because it never really focused on a particular aspect of the\nevents and, as such, was a little unwieldy and never really let its\ncharacters develop. To be sure, it has an impressive cast and all of\nthem do fine work, but few of them outside of Johnny Depp were given\nany room to make an impression. Still, this is a well-crafted film from\na technical perspective, with excellent camera-work, a good score\n(courtesy of Junkie XL, no less), and a welcome return to form by\nJohnny Depp. This is the best I've seen him in years, possibly since\nDONNIE BRASCO. For all of the faults in the narrative structure, Johnny\nDepp is what makes this worth watching. There are times when he was\nlegitimately frightening, even though a couple of these moments were\npartially given away in the trailers. Although BLACK MASS aspires to be\nin the same company as GOODFELLAS and DONNIE BRASCO, it doesn't quite\nlive up to them, at least in terms of lasting quality and\nrewatchability. Still, it is a perfectly serviceable true crime tale\nwith a top-notch performance by Depp, itself alone to recommend at\nleast one viewing.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis biopic of a famous Boston crime lord falls flat for a number of\nreasons. Depp acts his socks off and the make-up and camera departments\ndeserve credit for imbuing a coldness in those blue blue eyes.\nCumberbach also copes ably with a role that is a departure from much of\nhis previous work. But the story fails to engage. The main problem is\nthe FBI office. The complicity of the FBI in the rise of this nefarious\nindividual is what makes this story stand out, but the squabbling\nbetween the various characters in that setting lacks gravitas. Kevin\nBacon is unusually limited. The story chases Boston authenticity,\nforsaking gripping drama in the process. There is one scene where\nBulger plays mind games with an FBI officer over the dinner table about\na 'secret' family recipe. A potentially dramatic scene, if we hadn't\nwitnessed it before, beat for beat, in Goodfellas. Taking a\ncookie-cutter to that iconic 'You think I'm funny?' scene is\nsymptomatic of the lack of ambition and verve in this film. Not a\nterrible film, but the lack of risk, or surprise, is disappointing. The\nfilmmakers should have watched 'Snowtown' before starting out.\n"},

It's different, less flashy and maybe\nalso less entertaining, especially for people not used to \"slow\"\nmovies. However I also find it more realistic and thought-provoking.\nSome of the more critical opinions point out the \"lack of depth of the\ncharacters\", however we should not forget that real-life carrier\ncriminals are often in fact, less than complicated and certainly aren't\nthe uber cool guys often depicted on screen. They might be intelligent\nin some cases, but they are greedy, violent and don't have moral\nboundaries. Frequently they also show sadistic tendencies, as the\nprotagonist does. I consider it exhilarating that there's no\nglorification of organized crime and those involved in it, just a quite\nfaithful, as far as I know, adaptation of true events.<br><br>The stellar cast is top-notch, even secondary characters give a\nconvincing performance. Depp's acting is certainly Oscar-worthy, he is\nunrecognizable and really frightening. Edgerton is just perfect as the\nsleazy, yet loyal in his own twisted way, cop. Cumberbatch is solid as\nalways, I 'd have loved to see more of Kevin Bacon, one of my all- time\nfavorite actors. Furthermore, I was absolutely stunned by Sarsgaard's\nperformance, he really shines in his small part. <br><br>I definitively recommend you watch it in the cinema, in order to fully\nappreciate the style, the musical score and the gloomy atmosphere. I\ndidn't give it a 10/10 rating, because imho the editing should have\nbeen slightly tighter, especially during the first third of the film.\nOtherwise I hope time treats it kindly and puts it among the classics\nof its genre, as it deserves.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm Irish and I live in a Boston suburb. Here is what I would have done\nto make a better movie. Start the film in the projects when Connolly\nand the Bulgers were young. Show the environment they were raised\nin.The cops. the Catholic Church. All were relevant in their\nupbringing. How being a \"rat\" was considered more serious than being a\nmurderer. How loyalty was considered the most worthy quality. Tell us\nsomething about the growth of Howie Winter and the Winter Hill Gang and\nhow Bulger grew within that gang . Describe the relationship between\nthe Irish gangsters of Southie and the Mafia in the North End. Take the\nfirst 30 minutes of the movie as background and then tell the Connolly-\nBulger story. I didn't like the way that the Connolly angle shared\nequal screen with the Whitey angle. As for the Whitey Bulger portrayal,\nforget the drivel of the tragedies of his son and mother's deaths. The\nguy was a bad guy. The viewer doesn't need to be reminded that even bad\nguys have a heart once in a while. I never got the feeling that the\nwhole film was nothing more than the story of a local hood.A little\nknow gangster outside of South Boston. As for the Angiulo family, pure\nhogwash . My friends and i used to go over the the North End for pizza\nafter a Bruins game and we knew where Angiulo lived so how could the\nFBI not know. The actors' make up was horrible.

Now I'm not going to put it up there with the likes\nof \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino\" but it was good. I wasn't disappointed,\nbut I will say this, if Martin Scorsese had put his magical touch to\nthis film it would have been better. Johnny Depp put on a nice\nperformance as James 'Whitey' Bulger, almost Oscar worthy, as with Joel\nEdgerton, who played the role of John Connolly. The only problem I had\nwith this film was Johnny Depp's make up. To me the attempt to make him\nlook like James 'Whitey' Bulger only ended up looking \"Bad Grampa\"ish.\nThat really didn't take away from the film but it must have been pretty\nobvious if my wife noticed it being that she doesn't take movies as\nserious as I do. \"Black Mass\" is a film about James 'Whitey' Bulger\n(Johnny Depp), a violent gangster who becomes an FBI informant in order\nto take down a Mafia family who is disrupting his criminal activities\nand at the same time involving John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), an FBI\nagent. I heard of James 'Whitey' Bulger from documentaries and stories\nafter he got caught. If he was anything like the character Johnny Depp\nportrayed in this film he should be locked up forever!

{"review": "\nBased on the true story of Boston crime lord Whitey Bulger and his\nlongtime not-so-legitimate association with the FBI, 'Black Mass' tells\na notable slice of American history. The film is credited as a\nbiography on IMDb, which is not quite right; Johnny Depp is electric as\nBulger, but he is more of a supporting character in the tale with\nemphasis constantly on Joel Edgerton as his FBI contact - a childhood\nfriend who finds himself in a tricky position, torn between loyalty to\nthe Bureau and his a lifetime pal who has looked after him for as long\nas he can remember. It all seems fine at first, with Edgerton able to\noffer Depp immunity if he agrees to turn informant, however, as Depp\nmisuses his immunity to take down those around him and become even more\nruthless, Edgerton finds himself stuck in a corner. On one hand, all\nthe emphasis on Edgerton does not feel right. With limited room for\ncharacterisation, Depp's Bulger is defined in very broad brushstrokes;\nwe are led to believe that his anger over his son's death hardened him\nas a criminal, but we seldom see how he ticks beneath the tough\nsurface. On the other hand, Edgerton is so great wrestling with his\ninternal conflicts that more emphasis on him may have in fact been\nbetter. Either way, the film is quite uneven with all the jumping\nbetween characters, but solid acting keeps thing afloat. While Edgerton\nsteals the show, Depp has several excellent moments; his anger over a\n'family secret' recipe is a surefire highlight, and the scenes where he\nbonds with his son shed a lot of light on the way his mind works.\n"},
{"review": "\nI think some of the negative reviews comparing Black Mass to classics\nlike Goodfellas are being a little unfair.<br><br>Classics like The Godfather have already expertly dealt with the lure\nof power and how it ultimately corrupts, whilst Black Mass isn't in\nthat kind of league, it does offer a fresh perspective.<br><br>Depp's character is facilitated by FBI agents, who use him to take down\nother crime syndicates, whilst turning a blind eye to his dealings.\nThis idea that they created their own monster, believing that the end\njustifies the means, is an interesting theme, not really explored too\nmuch in this genre. Recently, The Departed touched on similar ground,\nwith Jack Nicholson's character actually being inspired by the\nreal-life Whitey Bulger, but Black Mass gives us the full story.<br><br>Depp gives a great performance as Whitey, all too often he's dismissed\nlately as a 'gimmicky' actor, but once again he proves he can deliver\nin a grown-up movie.

And sometimes his makeup was so bad that it made what\nshould have been his most powerful scenes look ridiculous. And there\nwere problems with the story and etc, etc. it is a shame because the\nstory of which this movie is based on is pure gold. The acting is\nexcellent almost all around. In the end, I think the ultimate fault\nfalls on the director. Hollywood needs to stop risking the outcome of\nproperties by saving a few dollars using noobie directors who have less\nthan 5 films under their belts.

When the credence for each\nother began fading out, drug dealing, murders, and extortion started to\nrise, and forced the FBI's Boston office to confirm that Whitey Bulger\nwas one of the most notorious criminals in US history and also one of\nthe FBI's Ten Most Wanted List criminals.'<br><br>Take a look at the cast \u0096 Peter Sarsgaard, Kevin Bacon, Dakota Johnson,\nJuno Temple, and an array of bit part players each with viable varying\naccents of Boston areas \u0096 and you can see how this violent evening\nwould work.

{"review": "\nGreetings from Lithuania.<br><br>\"Black Mass\" (2015) is a very true story about a local mobster in\nBoston, who by the help of FBI ruled the streets for some time. This is\na very good movie, absolving one, with great acting by all involved,\nvery solid directing, engaging script that never isn't boring, and is\ninvolving from start till finish. That said \"Black Mass\" isn't\n\"Goodfellas\" by any means, because you can re watch \"Goodfellas\" again\nand again, and \"Black Mass\" is basically a one time movie, but\nnevertheless it is a very solid one. <br><br>The best acting in this movie was not Johnny Depp's (altough he is VERY\ngood in here, haven't enjoyed Johnny Depp's movie in very, very long\nwhile now), but from superb and always reliable Joel Edgerton. He\ncreates or recreates in this case this FBI guy, who is as much as a\ngood guy trying to do good, but at the same time he is more then an\nfriend to James 'Whitey' Bulger - and that isn't a really good thing\nconsidering the circumstances, but he was as he was. This is a very\nsolid performance. And about Johnny Depp - in the beginning of this\nmovie noticing his eye lenses and make up - it was a bit to heavy in my\nopinion even distracting, but it grown on me during the movie, it is a\nvery solid performance.<br><br>Overall, Scott Cooper, a great director (of a brilliant \"Out of the\nFurnace\") does a very solid job in recreating true events. I liked this\nmovie very much, it not a classic by any means, but just a very solid\nfilm. I also liked that this movie never tried to show any glimpses of\nWhitey's redemption or anything like that - he was a bad guy at the\nbeginning, middle and the end - he is just a bad guy.

{"review": "\nThe title of Scott Cooper's effective, violent and atmospheric crime\ndrama Black Mass has several meanings. The first is a reference to the\nIrish-Catholic values of the film's real life subject, the gangster\nJames 'Whitey' Bulger, whose violent actions in South Boston from the\n1970s to the 1990s were a terrifying contradiction of his religious\nupbringing. The second meaning is a scientific and philosophical\nviewpoint, reflecting how matter or mass can never entirely disappear\nbut becomes invisible to the human eye. Invisibility was imperative for\nWhitey because according to the film, his attitude was that if no one\nwitnessed a crime, particularly a murder, it never happened. The\nmerciless brutality of Whitey is embodied by Johnny Depp, whose wicked\nperformance and hideous transformation ignites a desperate victory for\nthis once inventive character actor. He is matched by a colourful turn\nfrom Australian actor Joel Edgerton, who plays self-interested FBI\nagent John Connolly, a childhood friend of Whitey. Connolly represents\nanother form of darkness. Money and status encourage him to sweep away\nthe devil's crimes, meaning Black Mass is a film that draws from the\nOld Testament, warning us about how people of power and status succumb\nto life's temptations.

I thought all of the acting was great but there were time\nwhere I thought that there were to many F words, but what did you\nexpect there gangsters who don't what they say, how they say it l, and\nwho they say it to because they don't care. It wasn't as brutal as I\nthought it was but still bloody. All the reviews I've read about this\nfilm were just horrible and I don't get it. It wasn't that bad of a\nfilm I mean it's a gangster movie most of them are slow. I came into\nthe theater knowing that it might be slow. Look all I can say is is\nthat this is a good film and it talks about a cruel violent man who\ndidn't care about other people other then the people he associates\nwith.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is my second review on Black Mass. After having seen the German\nversion and leaving the theatre rather disappointed and empty, I\nthought I give it another try. And watched the OV in the cinema. So the\nwhole crime story of an unholy alliance between FBI and mobster Bulger\nagain in Boston American English. I must admit, despite much, maybe too\nmuch cursing and blood splatter, the film grew on me. Depp's\nperformance as Bulger definitely works for me (despite the original\nBulger not being amused about his portrayal). Maybe the whole thing\nworks best when not related too much to some \"true story\". True stories\nand Hollywood - let's face the facts, it's an oxymoron... Taken as a\nmere gangster movie, it works. I didn't learn very much about Bulger's\ncharacter or his motivation. The movie is still a collection of\nmurders, crimes and curses. But the somewhat creepy alliance between\nJames \"Whitey\" Bulger and his boyhood friend John Connolly evolves\nslowly and subtly from a \"friendly\" cooperation into a misunderstood\nloyalty and disaster for everyone involved. Loyalty is the glue and the\nbomb. But while Connolly insists on his loyalty to Bulger, Bulger stays\nrather loyal to himself... His criminal energy is always present,\nperfectly embodied by Johnny Depp. The whole cast is brilliant, may it\nbe main characters or supporting actors. Watching the film a second\ntime gave me a better overview and understanding. And more thrills,\ndespite the movie going at a rather slow pace, and still somehow\nmissing a plot. Yes, it's different than the usual Hollywood\nBam-Boom-Bang, smart characters, explosions and car chases. But once I\ngot used to the rather narrative, documentary and distant style, I was\nat times sucked into the film. Maybe I should watch it a third time...\n"}
