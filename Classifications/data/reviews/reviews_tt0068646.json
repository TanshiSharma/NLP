{"review": "\nRather than concentrating on everything that is great about The\nGodfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is\nbad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about\nit, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The\nGodfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out\nas bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.<br><br>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it\nearlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando\ncomes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al\nPacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also\nvery memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear\nit. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it\nis, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great\nepic.<br><br>The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost\ninstantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things\nhappen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made\nand entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it\nstands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't\nseen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that\ndidn't disappoint.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime,\nthis\nmovie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..<br><br>With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon\nBrando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia\nfamilies in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their\nbusiness runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business,\nfor\nexample their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot\nof\ntroubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day\ncould\nbe their last day..<br><br>Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family\nhe\nreturns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in\nthe family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose\nand\nhe see no other ways than to step in and fight for his\nfamily.<br><br>This is definetely a \"must see\" masterpiece.\n"},
{"review": "\n\n     This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and\nover the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29\nyears old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of\nmovies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what\nwill happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed,\nrelationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style\nmake the film memorable.  \n"},
{"review": "\n\nThe Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. \n Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie\n experiences of my life.  There's scenes that stay with you when the movies\n over, and you don't forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling\n this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The\n dialogue is just unbelievable.  I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times,\n and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting,\n everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever\n made...well, there's no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is\n more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I\n find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes\n throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie\never made,\n and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An\nensemble performance that has no weak spot.<br><br>Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza)\ngive wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe\nthat Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.<br><br>John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak\nFredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but\nknowing that he can never be what his father wants. <br><br>The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family\nbusiness,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid\npicture of this violent period of US history.<br><br>Do not miss this film!\n"},

I love\nthe characters and all of the different personalities that they\nrepresent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the\nentire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The\nsounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of\nthe film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which\nit was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself\nfeeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating\nthis film.

{"review": "\nThe Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum\nopus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a\nleague of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but\nrather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject\nvulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its\neloquence. <br><br>The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal\nperformances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave\nan Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant\nin his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his\nremarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito\nCorleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.<br><br>The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement\nmade about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most\naptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind,\nowing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in\nan utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended\nall the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.<br><br>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/\n"},
{"review": "\nThink epic novel crossed with Mafia speak.<br><br>Imagine excellent cinematography and direction, a great musical theme,\nviolence, tragedy, spectacle, and the family, and a cast which can't be\nfaulted, and here you have a film which fits the bill on all counts.<br><br>Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in one of his greatest roles, one which he\nsupposedly didn't initially want to play) is the powerful Mafia Don we\nmeet early in the film. He has three sons (Sonny - James Caan; Fredo -\nJohn Cazale; and Michael - Al Pacino) and a daughter (Talia Shire), and\nan adopted son (Tom Hagen - Robert Duvall). These are his beloved\nfamily and the centre of his world. His day job involves building his\nempire by making 'offers you can't refuse'.<br><br>'The Godfather' was the first film in a trilogy following the fortunes\nof the Corleone family, and I think the best. It has some\nwell-presented set pieces (Connie's wedding; Sonny's murder; Michael's\nkilling of family enemies in the restaurant; the horse's head in the\nbed; and Vito's death while playing with his grand-child) and is\nextremely well-written. The novel itself was more soapy, a work of pulp\nfiction - the film pulls it together and gives it a bit more class.<br><br>I particularly like the characterisations of Vito and his sons. Vito is\nassured in his role at the head of the premier Mafia family. Sonny is a\nvain libertine who is hot-headed. Fredo is a weak disappointment.\nMichael takes his place in the family when he has to (in fact\nthroughout the three films he is shown to be far more ruthless than any\nof his relatives).<br><br>Is 'The Godfather' the greatest film ever made? No, but it is one of\nthe best. Certainly in the top 10 films of the 1970s.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nFirst I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the\nfirst time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing\nreviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever\nmade) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being\neasily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult\nstatus that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen\nit.<br><br>I thought \"The Godfather\" was a good movie, but nothing more than that\nreally. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even\none of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've\nfinally seen it, but nothing more.<br><br>The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and\nthe appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don\nCorleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole\nthing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's \"business\"\nnever ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for\nfavours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of\ncourse, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his\nportrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance.\nFirst, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as\nCorleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far\nmore interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura\naround him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the\ncharacter of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the\nreturned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family \"business\" to the\neventual \"Don.\"<br><br>It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for\nthe most part very interesting. I just think I've seen\nbetter.<br><br>6/10\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Godfather is not just a crime film, it's much more deeper than\nthat. It's about loyalty, respect and more than anything, it's about\nfamily and real life. The casting in this movie is flawless. Marlon\nBrando as the Godfather is a perfect casting choice. He brings his\nunique style to his character and makes him alive. He's not just acting\nhis role, he's living it, at least that's what it feels like. He truly\ndeserves his Best Actor Oscar. Every scene where he is in and every\nline he says is emotionally touching and breathtaking, and it's not\njust because of his acting, but it's also because of the film's\nmagnificent writing and directing. The storyline is outstanding. It's\nbased on a novel written by Mario Puzo. Francis Ford Coppola did an\namazing job with bringing his story to the screen. He really gave us\nthe best film of all time. Brando wasn't the only one who did a\nwonderful job with his character, because even though Vito Corleone was\nthe key element of the movie, the movie was still mostly about his son,\nMichael Corleone, played by Al Pacino. You can really see his character\ndevelop during the movie, and you can feel the respect that his\ncharacter has toward his father. There's a real connection between\nthose two, even though they have a small number of scenes together.\nBesides Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, there were other supporting roles\nthat were amazing as well, like James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert\nDuvall as Tom Hagen and of course the beautiful Diana Keaton as Kay\nAdams. This movie has everything. Good acting, directing, writing,\ncinematography and of course memorable and recognizable music by Nino\nRota. In my opinion, there is only one misstep in this film, and that\nis the lighting in the wedding scene in the beginning of the movie. I\ncan honestly say that this is my favorite movie and if you haven't seen\nit yet, you should watch it as soon as possible! 10/10 Excellent!<br><br>(These are just my quick thoughts about this movie)\n"},
{"review": "\nIncredible!! With the epic soundtrack, characters, plot, casting, and\ndirecting this movie has to be considered THE best of all time.\nAlthough it is one of many Francis Ford Coppola masterpieces, this\nmovie stands apart from the others. By telling the Corleone story from\nthe inside of the family and mafia, viewers easily identify with and\ncare about the characters. The cinematography is amazing too, and some\nof the shots and scenes from this movie can be considered the best of\nany movie throughout time. You can see IMDb's 9.2 rating of The\nGodfather and hear about the movie as often as you want, but until you\nexperience the power of this film yourself, it will be impossible to\ngrasp the importance of the movie to cinema. Although this movie is\nfrom the early 70s, it is by no means dated. Michael Corleone is my\npersonal favorite character of all time, and the chance to see James\nCaan, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and John Cazale work\ntogether is unforgettable. Nobody could've known that Marlon Brando,\nwith two cotton balls, would create the most famous voice in cinematic\nhistory.\n"},
{"review": "\nSince I was a small boy, whenever I heard of others talking of the\ngreatest movies ever made, The Godfather always came up,most of the\ntime, at the top. I always thought that the movie was overrated, that\nis, until watched it two years ago.<br><br>How to tell if a movie is good? If you can't stop thinking about it, if\nyou keep replaying the characters' lines in your sleep, then the movie\nisn't just good, it's great. The Godfather's impact on the movie\nindustry is incalculable, in almost ever modern gangster movie there is\nat least one reference to it.<br><br>I can find no flaw in this movie. If there were anything such as a\n'perfect' movie, this is it. Coppola provides excellent direction such\nthat though the movie stretches to almost three hours, you won't be\nbored for one minute. <br><br>The highlight of this film is an innovation. The gangsters here are not\nportrayed as mindless monsters but as men with families. We see Vito\nand Michael Corleone as protagonists rather than antagonists. Credit\nfor this goes to Mario Puzo's original source material but let us not\nforget the actors.<br><br>Marlon Brando gives the greatest performance of not only his career but\nof any other actor as the family patriarch. He's so Don-like that you\njust wished you could go to him with all your problems too. Al Pacino\nplays Michael Corleone. But he doesn't give a single performance, he\ngives two. At the beginning, he plays a war hero who doesn't want\nanything to do with the family business. Pacino skillfully shows us\nMichael's transition from this to a cold blooded Don at the end. The\nother actors play their parts well too. In fact, there has never been\nany other better cast than the cast of The Godfather.<br><br>A cinematic masterpiece, this is one for the ages.\n"},

The acting is top notch, the cinematography is\nbeautiful, the filming locations and sets are perfect, the sound is\ngreat, the music is excellent... I could talk about how great this\nmovie is for hours. Francis Ford Coppola has a clear vision for this\nmovie, and is expertly brought to life.<br><br>The beginning of the film starts out at the wedding of Don Vito\nCorleone's daughter, Connie.

At the wedding, Vito's\nyoungest son, Michael, tells his then girlfriend, Kay, that he was not\nlike his family. Throughout the rest of the film, we see Michael\nCorleone transform into the very thing he claims he hates. It's an\nexcellent example of how character growth should be done.<br><br>From the intriguing beginning where we find Vito Corleone being asked\nfor favors, to the climatic ending where Michael finishes his\ntransformation, The Godfather is a landmark film in American cinema.\n"},
{"review": "\nThere isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The\nGodfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At\nthe centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by\nVito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's\nwedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key\nindividuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running\ntheme of business and personal matters never mix. <br><br>The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family.\nThink before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the\npeace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest\nson Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn\napart as he takes control of the family business.<br><br>With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the\nlast time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered.\nBrando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the\nsmallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert\nDuvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes.

{"review": "\nThis film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its\nattention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful\nscreenplay.

As for the\nperformances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire\ncast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is\nthe fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for\nthe roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their\nrespective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor\nactress who seems \"too old or young for the part\". Nor does anyone\n(including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem \"out of place\" or\n\"unconvincing\". The plot and storyline could not have been better and\nthis is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still\ncontinues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of\nthe classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and\nwill probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS \"The Godfather\nSaga\" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which\nis absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with\nthe eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not\nlike this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.\n"},

A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best\nDirector-- Bob Fosse (for \"Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a\nmuch better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that \"Cabaret\" won.The\nother seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound,\nEditing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So\nwhen the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the\nAward goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two\nstatues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay).

{"review": "\n\nSpoilers herein.<br><br>Building a life in film is not so much a matter of discovering the\nworthwhile films, but choosing which of those have the stuff worth building\nwith. I have a clear understanding of what Scorsese is about, which I\nattribute to the Latin convention for storytelling. This convention is\ntotally invested in characters, not situation or place or God help us,\nideas. Scorsese's camera is attached to people, never place. His curiosity\nis always about people. This is a form of visual gossip that I\neschew.<br><br>So it is with Coppola. But his two projects (the Godfather and Apocalypse\njourneys) have another merit in how they work with what came before.\nApocalypse is far more interesting in this respect. But `Godfather' is very\nclever in how it places itself. Gangster pictures began as a matter of a\npretend world, and became ever more so as the genre matured. Mobsters lived\nin a world not unlike that of the Roadrunner,  always at a distance from\nreality, often winking at the audience.<br><br>Coppola took his focus on the human to this genre. The film itself is no\nmasterpiece without this placement, but is great with it. We inherit all the\nmachinery and momentum of the genre to place behind the characters.

{"review": "\nThere is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular\nculture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off,\nriffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is\nalways a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and\nbecome comical and stale. <br><br>The Godfather, however, disproves this. It is still a masterpiece, and\nalways will be. The story-line proves once again how much the innocent\npublic loves to view the lives of outright evil men, especially when\nthey happen to be of the charming and charismatic variety. Let's look\nat the most iconic scene; a man chops off a horse's head, and leaves it\nin his owner's bed in order to scare him into submission.

The Godfather\nis darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour,\nobligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and\ntrust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead\nwith Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid.\nPerfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'.

Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the\nfictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years\n1945\u009655, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from\nreluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the\nfamily under the patriarch Vito.<br><br>Based on Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, The Godfather is\nwidely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and as one\nof the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. Ranked\nsecond to Citizen Kane by the American Film Institute in 2007,it was\nselected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry\nof the Library of Congress in 1990 as being \"culturally, historically,\nor aesthetically significant\".<br><br>The film was the box office leader for 1972 and was, for a time, the\nhighest-grossing picture ever made. It won three Academy Awards for\nthat year: Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best\nAdapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other\ncategories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best\nSupporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two\nsequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in\n1990.\n"},

Highly recommended. have seen The Godfather movies too many times\nto count. It's part of the lexicon in my family, we quote lines from it\nall the time in regular conversation. So, I thought this book might be\na little boring, just because I already knew the story so well. Not the\ncase! The book adds so much detail to the story that I think I'll be\nwatching the movie again soon in a whole new light.

You realize\nhow every character here is crucial to the story at some point. There\nis a huge amount of suspense in many occasions and the scenes where\nsomeone gets executed can be quite abrupt, being always thrilling.

He owned that role as this aging patriarch and head\nof one of the most powerful mafia families in the area of New York in\nthe 1940s. Every time he was on screen, I felt compelled by what he was\nsaying. Don Vito is just very rich as a character as he values respect\nmore than anything, being always eloquent and caring towards others. Al\nPacino gives a very nuanced performance as Michael Corleone, one of Don\nVito's sons. Following his transition as a character was truly\nremarkable. The final moments in the film reflect that in a very\npowerful and intense manner. Finally, I have to say The Godfather\ndefinitely has one of the most beautiful scores I've ever heard.\n"},

{"review": "\nRarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is\nthat more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of\nthe 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was\nnamed Best Picture), all \"gangster movies\" have been judged by the\nstandards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is\nabout Jewish mobsters, it's a \"Jewish Godfather\"; if it's about the\nChinese underworld, it's an \"Oriental Godfather\"; if it takes place in\ncontemporary times, it's a \"modern day Godfather\".<br><br>If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never\nhave garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film\napart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to\nweave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of\nthe individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to\nform the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many\ncomplimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a\nseries of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive\nconclusion.<br><br>Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories.\nStrong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all\ncontribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not\nslapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was\ncarefully and painstakingly crafted.

The best summary for this film\nwould be about an aging mob boss named Don Vito Corleone (played by\nMarlon Brando in an Oscar winning performance) who in a few years time\nis going to retire from his position as Godfather and pass the Corleone\nfamily leadership to his reluctant war hero son Michael (played by Al\nPacino in a performance that should have won him the Oscar as 1972s\nbest supporting actor). Besides GoodFellas and Bonnie and Clyde having\nthe most obvious thing in common with this film is that all three films\ntalk about the mob, and the second thing that all three films have in\ncommon is that they give people who watch them how ruthless the mob can\nbe in real life. Though I didn't read the Mario Puzo novel I understood\nthis film perfectly thanks to all the perfectly acted performances by\nBrando and Pacino, but as well as Robert Duvall as the family lawyer\nTom Hagen, James Caan as Sonny, as well as John Cazale as Fredo.\nCoppola's film not only depicts how ruthless the mob can be in some\ninstances but also how violent the mob can be as well as those were the\nperfect requirements for movies like this. The one thing I really\ndisagreed with most with the 45th Oscar ceremony is why Marlon Brando\nrejected his 2nd academy award for lead acting when in this movie he\ngave the best performance of his entire since A Streetcar Named Desire\n(1951) and On the Waterfront (1954), and as to why Francis Ford Coppola\ndidn't win the Academy Award for best director when I really do think\nhe deserved it.

{"review": "\nTHE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic\nin the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film\never shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits\npitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making\nas it should be.<br><br>Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow.\nNevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story -\nof a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia\nfamilies - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola\nturns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human\ncondition, perhaps.<br><br>Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity.\nJealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the\nfilm is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking\nviolence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said\nviolence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does\nhappen.<br><br>Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past\nhis prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino,\nwho burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to\nmiss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile\nSonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is\na splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably\nspawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE\nGODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.\n"},

{"review": "\nFor mafia members murders are nothing but business. They never kill for\npleasure. Only in case of need, cold revenge or even summary justice\n(punishment of traitors for instance). Besides this they all have\nnormal family lives with most cherished spouses and children and are\nusually very religious making pompous wedding, christening and funeral\nceremonies in the Church or under priests' directions. This reality and\natmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a\nsuperb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a\nstupendous performance. Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the\nrole of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families,\nmastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus\ncreating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The\naction unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want\nto stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new\nfamily godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the\nchild (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest\nwhile a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival\nmafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other\nplaces and which had been ordered by himself. The contrast of the\nreligious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive\nand full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever\nmade.\n"},

{"review": "\nThe first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (\"I believe\nin America\") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia\nDon Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of\nhis adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces\nthe American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful\ncelebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism,\nand continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for\nvengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed\nsheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic\ndisplays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a\nshading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of\nfootsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and\nMario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by\nitself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing\npatriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual\nviolence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like\nreading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical\nnovel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with\nchanging times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly\neffective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two\nperhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.\n"},

{"review": "\nThe Godfather is simply put a masterpiece. I would highly recommend it\nto anyone who hasn't had the chance to enjoy Coppola's best movie.\nFirst off, the actor's performances are top notch. Al-Gore especially\ndoes an amazing job as Michael, always wearing a serious face, really\nbecoming a very professional gangster. The other actors also contribute\nimmensely to the film but none stand out quite like Robert Duvall,\nBesides Al-Gore. From humble beginnings as Bo Riddley, Duvall really\nhas come a far way as he plays the character of Tom Hagen, Lawyer of\nthe mob. Next there's the shots. Almost all shots have a purpose, from\nthe beginning shot over the godfather's shoulder to slowly approaching\na man sleeping with his horse's head. Similar to how shots serve a\npurpose to the movies progression, so do props. An iconic prop from the\ngodfather are the oranges. Coppola places oranges in scenes to\nforeshadow that something bad is about to happen, like when the\ngodfather gets shot he's buying oranges! The sound track was also very\nwell done. The violins really give a mobby feel and how the music built\nup during certain scenes really helped build up tension.(Spoilers) My\nfavorite parts of the movie were when they hit the driver near the\nstatue of liberty, when Michael kills the opposing mob boss and cop,\nThe final scene when Michael closes the door on his girlfriend, and\nfinally, my favorite, the epic finale where each mob boss is killed of\none by one as Michael becomes a literal godfather to his sister's child\nand the godfather of the mob.

{"review": "\nThe Godfather (including Part 2 for purpose of this review) is probably\nthe most analysed film of all time, so really I don't see the point in\nrepeating any of the rhetorics. Rather, what I intend to provide here\nis my honest two cents of this film.<br><br>The Godfather is not an easy film to watch, so it baffled me at that\ntime of watching for the first time (and still baffles me to this day)\nhow it is so universally loved by almost anyone who has watched it.\nFirstly, there are so many characters that I gave up remembering anyone\nother than the Corleone family. Secondly, the script is so subtle and\ntight that the moment I missed a single sentence, I did not get the\nnext scene. It was no easy feat to follow every sentence given the\nfrequent mutterings, so subtitles are almost indispensable. In the end,\nI pretty much referred to the plot synopsis every 5 minutes.<br><br>Make no mistake, the reasons above are also what probably makes the\nGodfather regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It just\nsurprises me how a film as subtle as the Godfather has received just as\nmuch attention as 'lighter' classics such as Star Wars, Pulp Fiction,\nTaxi Driver, Goodfellas, etc.<br><br>Ultimately, my verdict is that the Godfather is a great, iconic film\nfrom the 70s era, but my honest take is that the Godfather is perhaps a\nlittle over-hyped (not overrated, but over-hyped) to the extent that it\ngets more exposure than some of the other equally great films from the\nolden era. For that, the Godfather is a great film, but is not in my\nconsideration for the greatest film of all time.\n"},

The\nplot is not to be detailed, as it's one of the most famous movies, but\nI can assure everyone, this is the strongest part of the film. Of\ncourse there are some action scenes where bad people shoot with guns,\nthere are some romantic scenes where beautiful woman make love with\nhandsome man, but all of these give the essential of the Godfather. We\nlearn the rules of this world, without directly being told each of\nthem. We become the part of the family, and we suffer or win, as the\nCorleones do. We start to worry about the characters, that feel alive\nand realistic. Our first, probably negative impression are getting\noverwrite by the deeper, and more considered emotions, which are more\nlikely to be positive. We understand that some things have to be done,\nno matter what the moral says. Yes, we can live the live of the\nCorleones, and that's a thing not every movie can provide.

{"review": "\nEveryone at some point will see \"The Godfather\" unless they live under\na rock. This classic beginning of an epic trilogy beholds a crime story\nunlike any other for one reason: it doesn't view the crimes as crimes.\nFrancis Ford Coppola shows the business end behind the Italian mafia\nafter WW II. Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) passes his organized crime\ndynasty to to his reluctant son Michael (Al Pacino) after tensions rise\nbetween his fellow Mafia families. This epic reflects a struggle\nbetween a family caught up in crime and portrays the consequences that\nerupt due to such activity. Coppola engages audiences with the settings\nhe portrays with wonderful music and camera work that helps tension\nrise and lets viewers experience the characters' emotions. Unlike many\nother films made in the seventies, \"The Godfather\" gets its production\nvalue right. It has fantastic costumes and sets that allow you to\nengage in the characters' conflicts. But what this film does best is\nshow the devastation of a family enlisted in a horrible business that\ncan prove fatal. It makes you rethink everything you know about mafia\nand show a humanized version of real people who, due to their family,\nend up doing bad things. This isn't a film about bad people. It's a\nfilm about people doing bad things, all in the name of business.\n"},
