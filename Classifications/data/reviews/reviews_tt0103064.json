{"review": "\nReview based on the Special Edition cut: <br><br>In 1984 young director James Cameron took us into a new world with 'The\nTerminator,' a film that was a great success. Two years later he would\ndazzle us again with 'Aliens.' He had proved he was no one hit wonder,\nbut the 1980s would soon be over and one burning question remained:\nWill there ever be a 'The Terminator 2'? Fortunately for those of us\nwho cherish the original that day came 7 years after that films release\nand the world would never be the same. This sequel, the first of a few,\nturned out to be bigger and took the concept farther, which is exactly\nwhat a sequel to a Science Fiction classic should do.<br><br>Pros: Excellent work done by the cast. Compelling score. Dazzling\nspecial, mechanical, and visual effects. Beautifully photographed.\nMoves at a good pace. Like the original this film has some real heart\nand intelligence in it. Successfully builds on the mythology started in\nthe original. Some solid action sequences and set pieces. Good humorous\nbits.

Not many, but\nsome effects don't measure up, especially the dummy used for Arnold\nSchwarzenegger.<br><br>Final thoughts: Fans of the 1984 original had to wait quite a while for\nthe story to continue and I think we were greatly rewarded. It's lucky\nthat the original creator returned to continue this and that the studio\ncared about the quality of the film.

The main reason James Cameron\nmade this masterpiece was not because he only wanted to make money. All\nthe greatest movies of all time deal with an important issue about\nhumanity and T2 is no exception. It deals with how humanity has a\ntendency to destroy itself.

This masterpiece works on so\nmany levels that it's truly amazing. It contains some of the best\nvisual effects and action scenes ever put on film. It is a thrill ride\nfrom beginning to end and the great character interaction and drama\nnever stops. During each action scene you always feel that the\ncharacters are fighting for the fate of humanity. By far James\nCameron's best film and that is saying a lot. It's much more emotional\nand dramatic than Cameron's overrated and disappointing Titanic. T2\nclearly shows that James Cameron is most creative and artistic when he\nis making an Action/Sci-fi film.

After Arnolds diasasters\nsuch\nas End of Days (not bad flick) he needed a hit\nand the only way was to bring the Terminator out of retirement, with or\nwithout Cameron.  Thats Loyalty for you.<br><br>T2 is the best action movie ever made, and if you have not seen it yet,\nyou\nhave probably seen paradies, ripoffs, and copies of the movie.<br><br>But watching the original will give an appreciation as to how this movie\nshaped future action movies, as it is groundbreaking.<br><br>I wished James Cameron had made T3, but I doubt he could have topped the\nperfection of T2, and that may be one of the reasons he decided to opt out\nof T3.  \n"},

{"review": "\nA+ Following the first film came a rare sequel indeed. It is beyond\nrare to find a sequel that takes it predecessor and expands it, deepens\nit, and ultimately surpasses it tenfold. And \"Terminator\" was a good\nmovie all its own. \"T2\" does that in almost every way imaginable.<br><br>With \"T1\" we were left with a lot of unanswered questions, but here we\nget those and more. We have a very good cast rolled out here for\naudiences to enjoy, among them obviously Arnold and Linda Hamilton as a\ntougher Sarah Conner. Edward furlong is the legendary John Connor, a\nrole that I doubt few of that time could fill. I won't drag this on any\nlonger than I have to seeing as everybody's' seen the film by now. The\nthing that sets this film apart from many films is the characters and a\nwell driven story. Most action films are easily forgettable with\ncharacters I could care less about. You're just there for the big\nexplosions. But Cameron develops his quite well. And as the movie nears\nits end, we are left with a very good interpretation of who they were\nand why they did what they did. The terminator undergoes a complete\ntransformation from the first film as a silent and menacing killer to a\nbeing we know is definitely not human but we care for it just the same.\nExuberantly well done. That role is replaced by the T-1000, played by\nRobert Patrick. Even more menacing as than the first one really.<br><br>The action is obviously well played, fresh and VERY intense. Unlike\ntoday's CGI over laden, over the top antics. An unrivaled achievement\nof film history and a legacy that lives to this day.\n"},
{"review": "\nI consider this movie to be a classic, and for good reason. The CGI is\namazing, even for today's standards, and this was released back in '91!\nThe action is explosive, the directing is superb, and the acting was\nvery good, at least believable! Action movies don't require a lot of\nacting, heck even a coherent plot, but this movie delivers both big\ntime thanks to film master, James Cameron. The plot sets back in '91,\nwhere we see the famous \"Ahhnold!\" teleported back in time, not to kill\nSarah Conner or even her son, but to protect them, from the vicious,\nmore advanced T-1000! The plot change is enough to make fan excited,\nbecause now you know your in a whole new better adventure, and not just\nmore of the same. It's actually very touching to see \"The Terminator\"\ndevelop a relationship with young John Conner within the movie as it\nprogresses. I'll admit, I wept a little bit in the end when \"the\nterminator\" sacrificed himself for the good of man kind, and as he's\ndrowning in the pool of lava, he gives a thumbs up to John for a\nmission accomplished, seeming that \"the terminator\" actually has a\nconscience, if not a heart. For me though, I give this movie two thumbs\nway up! The effects are awesome, especially from the T-1000 aka liquid\nmetal, it has the most memorable action/chase scene I can remember in a\nmovie when T-1000 is chasing little John Conner with a big mack truck.\nBottom line, this movie has it all.

{"review": "\n\nAfter the release of \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", we all knew James Cameron\nwas the best director for sequels. He had already proved that a sequel could\nsurpass the original with \"Aliens\", but with this one, he took it to a whole\nnew level. The story of the 1984 hit thriller \"The Terminator\" is about a\ncyborg machine sent back through time to kill the future-mother of a\nmilitary leader who will supposedly, take mankind to victory against the\nmachines in an upcoming war. \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" takes us about 13\nyears later. Sarah Connor is now in a mental institution after trying to\nblow up Cyberdyne. Her now-born-son, John Connor lives with his foster\nparents. But when a terminator called T-1000 comes to kill John, his only\nhope lies with the same terminator that once tried to kill his mother.\nTogether, they will help Sarah to escape from the mental institution,\ndestroy Cyberdyne to avoid judgment day and fight a metal-liquid made\nterminator, that seems invincible. \nWhat is so great with this movie is two things: the special effects and the\nscript. James Cameron truly wrote a script superior to the original ad added\nmore depth to the story. The special effects by Stan Winston are truly\nremarkable. They introduced CGI Animation to the world, long before <br><br>\"Jurassic Park\" or \"The Matrix\", to create some of the most impressive\nstunts and effects ever made with a movie. If James Cameron hadn't\ndone\"Titanic\" a few years after that, \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" would've\nbeen his masterpiece. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives his best performance in\ncareer as the good terminator to battle the invincible T-1000, played\nremarkably by Robert Patrick. \n\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" came out on July 3rd, 1991, and took in more\nthan $500 million worldwide, including $204 million in the U.S. alone. It\nwasn't only a movie, it was a phenomenon. I give \"Terminator 2: Judgment\nDay\" a very good 9.5/10      \n"},

However, the cyborg must then\ndestroy itself in order to eliminate its chance of being used to help\nfuel the future war with the machines.

{"review": "\nIn the iron foundry the Terminator gets his left arm ripped off in a\ncogwheel. He leaves it there. This means that it is NOT destroyed along\nwith the laboratory arm and micro chip after the destruction of the\nT1000, and thus, when the Terminator is lowered into the molten iron,\nthere is STILL a robot arm in existence. The arm is bound to be found\nby scientists like Dyson who will eventually replicate it. This just\nshows that you can't change the future by changing the past. World War\nIII is bound to happen but hopefully only in the Terminator universe.

Every detail of this cult movie, from the plot\nto the music was awesome. <br><br>In the first movie, the terminator was the bad guy. With a tremendous\nbody like Greek gods and his robot-like accent, Arnold Schwarzenegger\nwas a perfect fit to the Terminator character. He was sent back from\nfuture to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of an unborn\nchild who will become the leader of a resistance against the machines.\nWe all know the story. But in T2, he came back to protect the son of\nSarah Connor which I believe was a very good twist. Arnold did his part\nvery well again as the cyborg of our dreams.

About the script, I say it is very humane\nafter all. You see, we build machines and kill each other from the\nbeginning of history. And we never stop shedding blood. And in this\nmovie, James Cameron did the best to prove that we hold the most value\nas human being and we should never ever hurt ourselves, with or without\nthe hopeless inventions.

Edward Furlong plays John\nConnor, Sarah's son who are on the run from a new terminator, the T-\n1000. Robert Patrick plays this terminator and he's got a knack for it\ntoo.

{"review": "\nI am a very enthusiastic and dedicated movie fan and reviewer. I want\nit known that this movie is without a doubt the best and most complete\nmovie I have seen in my 26 year existence.<br><br>Between the brilliant music, casting, directing, cinematography, and\nplot I have adamantly defended this movie again and again to the\nnegligent and the educated. It is simply perfect in every respect. I\nhave gone into movies the last 16 years waiting for something to beat\nthis title but nothing has. When something does surpass this title one\nday I will stand and applaud. This is quite simply the best movie ever\nmade!\n"},
{"review": "\nBeing a Terminator 2 fan for some years now I think it finally deserves\na comment. From the first time I witnessed the fast paced action, high\npowered weaponry and the the T-1000 emerging from explosions and\nfloors, I was immediately hooked. I don't think there's any aspect of\nthis film that I don't like, it really has a great feel of humanity's\nstruggle against the creation of Skynet which will be responsible for\nthe loss of so much life.<br><br>It's hard to pick out the best performance here, with Linda Hamilton\nportraying such a cold character (almost like a Terminator herself), to\nRobert Patrick's excellent performance as the new Terminator, the\nT-1000. Even young Edward Furlong is fantastic in this picture being\njust 9 years of age as the young John Connor. And of course you have\nSchwartzenegger, who is playing the role he was born to play, unlike\nthe clich\u00e9 he turns into in Rise of the Machines.<br><br>I would highly recommend film to anyone. From a distance it might just\nlook like your mindless science-fiction action movie with robots and\nexplosions, but it really is just so much more than that. The\nproduction value is phenomenal with great chase scenes and fantastic\nspecial effects, even by todays standards. And as I mentioned the\nperformances by the actors are fantastic. But more than all that I\nthink is the whole feel of the movie, which contrasts good over evil\nbrilliantly.<br><br>10/10, your not going to find a better action movie than this, buy it\non special edition if you haven't already..\n"},
{"review": "\nWith nearly 650 reviews at this point, I haven't read them all so I may\nbe repeating something which has been said elsewhere (although I\nhaven't spotted it among the pages I've sampled).<br><br>I liked the way Cameron didn't so much repeat the first film as echo it\n- there were many places where something from the original showed up\nagain, but in a different context, making a different point, driving\nthe plot forward.<br><br>I liked the way that the gradual role reversal from the first film\n(Reese strong and supportive, Sarah weak and helpless at the start,\nexactly reversed by the end) was echoed in the relationship between\nSarah and John.<br><br>Which is why I was particularly surprised at the garage scene with the\nlearning chip being cut from the release print - not only does it\nilluminate several points which follow it and which don't make sense\notherwise, it is also the pivotal moment when John assumes the dominant\nrole in his relationship with his mother which, in turn, echoes the\nmoment in the first film when Sarah starts protecting Kyle rather than\nvice versa.<br><br>And another vote in favour of the groundbreaking effects, particularly\nthe way they served the story rather than becoming the reason for it.\n"},
{"review": "\nI adore this movie. I could never stand action movies, but T2 is so\nintelligent and moving that it stands apart from everything else.<br><br>First, the story - brilliant, smoothly making the necessary transition\nfrom T1. The dialogue runs the gamut from hilarious to heartbreaking,\nbut always strikes exactly the right chord.<br><br>The cinematography and effects are stunning, especially the scenes\nfilmed during \"magic hour\", when the pale gold of sunset casts a\nmeaningful and lovely effect on the scene. Being the first $100 million\nmovie naturally the effects are remarkable for their time, but they\nhold up wonderfully against anything made today.<br><br>It's the actors, however, who steal the show. Linda Hamilton can play\ninsanity and despair like nobody's business, and she gave her all here.\nRobert Patrick was wonderful in the demanding role of the T-1000,\ncreepy and threatening even during the funny finger-wagging moment.\nArnold Schwarzenegger balances non-stop action with a machine's\nemerging humanity; frankly this movie cancels out every dumb action\nflick he ever made. New-comer Edward Furlong carried the film with\nseeming ease, giving an astonishing performance for his age and lack of\nexperience; the \"We're not gonna make it, are we?\" scene is hauntingly\nperfect.<br><br>James Cameron and his team have given us a classic that has something\nfor everyone. You'd never know that this is the guy who made Titanic.<br><br>Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence, Strong Action and Profanity.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm not even going to bother with a real review of this film, because\nit has like 4000 other reviews and most people know what it is even if\nthey haven't seen it. Sarah Conner's in an insane asylum, and a robot\nfrom the future has come to kill her son. But don't worry, because her\nson (in the future) sent his own robot back to kill the other robot and\nsave the son (himself). Yeah, it might not make sense from a time\ntravel point of view, but just deal with it.<br><br>What to say? Arnold is great, as usual (though this is no \"Commando\").\nEdward Furlong is young, but does a fine job. I don't have the crush on\nhim some people do, but he's cool. Robert Patrick is also awesome, even\nif he has creepy weird ears. And this is more action than you'll get in\nmost films, which is probably what you want if you're watching this.<br><br>There, that was my little review. Maybe next time i see the film, I'll\nexpand it to something with substance. But for now, this is good\nenough... read the other reviews instead. (Yes, you can vote this to\nthe very bottom of \"helpful\" reviews.)\n"},
{"review": "\nTERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, in my opinion, is an excellent,\nnail-biting, edge-of-your-seat thriller that's sure to make you feel\ngood and take your breath away. If you ask me, Arnold and Linda\nHamilton deliver electrifying performances that are out of this world.\nIf you ask me, the liquid metal and special effects were fantastic.\nWhen Sarah (Linda Hamilton) and John (Edward Furlong) were being\npursued by T-1000 (Robert Patrick), I was on the edge of my seat the\nentire time. In conclusion, if you like thrillers that will blow you\naway or are a fan of Arnold or Linda Hamilton, I strongly recommend\nthis excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat thriller that's sure to\nmake you feel good and take your breath away.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nSuperior to the first episode in every single way. In this episode a\ncyborg\n(T-800) is sent back in time to protect a 10-year old boy named John\nConnor.\nHe will be the future leader of humanity that tries to resist the\nrelentless\nkilling machines. This action/sci-fi masterpiece is extremely cool but\nmost\nimportantly very smart. It is also very emotional and artistic. The words\nartistic and emotional don't apply to any other action movie but only to\nthis timeless James Cameron masterpiece.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie blew me away when I saw it in the theatre - as much for the\nthoughtful ending as for the FX, story, characterization. There are very\nfew\nmovies I would give a 'ten', this being one of them, despite the time\ntravel\nstory, which I normally don't like in SF. There are only a handful of SF\nmovies that equal this one, (2001, Contact, Star Wars:Empire Strikes Back)\nnone really exceed it; it's THAT good. Overall best action SF movie out\nthere - a must own.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nAnd really, this is what T2 is.  Giving Arnold the Kyle Resse role the time\naround to promote Schwarzenegger's then newer \"good guy\" image.  But\ndownplaying that, this film definitely keeps the entertainment and wow\nfactor.<br><br>It's T-800 versus the shape-shifting T-1000 in another battle for the future\nand the fate of John Connor.  A more buff version of Linda Hamilton.  A\nsupporting role from Sam of \"Diff'rent Stokes\" as John's punk friend.  Lots\nof explosions, gun fights and chases.  And still remarkably good special\neffects even by today's standards.  Schwarzenegger has charisma.  His acting\nrange is best in two areas, acting and comedy, and this film allows him to\ndo both.  His cyborg persona's attempt to understand humanity ranges from\nfunny to surprisingly touching.  The plot is a retelling of the original\nfilm, but it's a secondary point for the sheer entertainment value that's\ndelivered from this film. <br><br>There's not much that truly can be said about this film ten years after its\nrelease.  It's a landmark film in the sci-fi genre, especially for its\ntechnical advances with CG effects.  The \"Ultimate Edition\" DVD released\nlast year is a \"must get\" as it adds deleted scenes to the film (The\nTerminator learning to smile is well worth the price of admission), as well\nas the \"extras\" book and all the \"Behind the Scenes\" information.  And the\naudio quality is nothing to sneeze at, either.  An excellent demonstration\nof any sound system.<br><br>Terminator 2: Judgement Day remains a remarkable film.  Go in expecting lots\nof action and a classic Arnold performance, and there will be little to be\ndisappointed with.  With a \"T3\" in the works, it seems that not only the\nfuture of humanity is uncertain, but of this franchise as well.  Hopefully\nthey'll be able to one-up the standards of sci-fi again, and not be out just\nto make a quick buck.\n"},

{"review": "\n\nJames Cameron is a God.  He has to be.  There are so few directors that\ncan\nmake films the way he can.  In fact I would go out on a limb here and say\nthat besides Spielberg ( who himself is a God ) no one can make films the\nway he can.  Terminator was a great film.  But T2 is really heads and\nshoulders above it.  Sequels don't usually surpass the original, but this\none sure did.<br><br>T2 explores so many of the same issues as the first one but it goes deeper\ninto them.  It gives us more visuals of what a desolate future would be\nlike\nafter a nuclear war.  And it gives more reason to be pessimistic towards\nour\nown species.  \" We're not going to make it, are we? \" John asks the\nTerminator.  \" It's in your nature to desroy yourselves. \"  How chilling\nis\nthat?  And how true?  As a sci-fi/action movie, this is one of the best.\nBut this could also be taken on the same level as a horror film.  Just an\nincredibly expensive and well made horror film.<br><br>What an idea to add to the first films paranoia by not just having Arnold\ncome back to play a good Terminator, but to have the seemingly invincible\nT-1000 become the enemy added a whole new dimension to the\nfilm.<br><br>This film has a bigger budget and it had higher expectations but it did\nnot\ncease from being dark and intelligent enough to make us think.  It also\nhas\nsome great humour.  And Arnold doesn't disappoint, he utter the famous\nline\n\" I'll be back! \"<br><br>T2 is a movie miracle.  It is so well made and enteraining while having a\nmessage that it is quite simply one of the best films ever made.  I love\nwhat James Cameron does when he is behind a camera and I loved this movie.\nIt is a true work of art.  And one hell of an entertaining\nfilm.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis One's a seriously moving picture. Don't get me wrong,\nit's\naction packed and is full of enough shrapnel to de-bark a\nforest,\nbut the underlying message and subversive tones of whatever you can find\nwrong with the future of the world within the story is to impress about\nmore.\n"},
{"review": "\nThere is a saying that sequels never surpass the original. Well, this\none does, and can I say, BIG TIME! Besides the special effects, and\nthey are great, is the sheer terror and hopelessness the main\ncharacters are in. How do you stop a relentless, ruthless killing\nmachine? Linda Hamilton was superb in T2.(I fell in love with that\nbody!) She was almost as unstoppable as the machine in her pursuit of\nsaving her son and mankind. I'm not a fan of your basic Sci-fi special\neffects. Snarling aliens drooling slime all over their victims, and\ngross mutant alien-babies popping out of humans don't thrill me. But it\nT2, Cameron does it best, it's more believable. With technology these\nthings could happen. I was blown out of my seat with the EXTREME\nspecial effects, and chase scenes. This is the best action movie I have\never seen, BY FAR! If this movie doesn't blow you away, you better\ncheck your pulse rate. My recommendations? See it on a big screen and\ncrank up the volume.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is one of James Cameron's best to date. It is also Arnold\nSchwarzenegger's best. I liked this movie better than the first\nTerminator film, but I thought the first film was good though. This\nmovie has awesome special effects and visual effects, top notch acting\nand a very good storyline. In this film, the Terminator is sent back to\nprotect John Connor and Sarah Connor from a more advanced more powerful\nterminator, the T-1000. I liked Robert Patrick's portrayal as the\nT-1000 in this movie. This is Robert Patrick's best film role to date\nso far. Sarah Connor is more psycho and more stronger in this film than\nshe was in the first one. Like I said, I think this film is better than\nthe first one. This movie is the breakthrough movie with the use of CG.\nCreating the first computer animated villain and a partially computer\nanimated main character. This movie is definitely worth a watch and\ntime well spent.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is the BEST sequel ever made to a movie! Terminator was a great\nmovie but T2 made the whole thing one of the best movie franchises\never. I mean who wouldn't know the quote \"Hasta la vista Baby\" One more\nthing about this masterpiece. It has the best use of CGI i've ever\nseen. The CGIs looks great (not for just its time i find it appealing\neven now the t1000 looks great) but the great thing is that CGI is not\noverused like in films nowadays. All together i think this movie got it\nall right, great story, great action scenes, lots of explosions, great\ncgi so yes it is one of the best movies ever and i still think this is\nthe best sequel!\n"},
{"review": "\nI was 13 when this movie came out and as a 13 year old lad I loved this\nmovie. I hadn't seen it in years and just watched it again. I have to\nsay it just keeps getting better. The visual effects still look\nimpressive all these years later and the soundtrack is amazing. The\nT-1000 is probably one of the best baddies in a movie ever. It is\ntotally relentless in it's attempts to kill John Connor and it's up to\nthe older model Terminator (Arnie) to protect John at all costs.\nThere's nothing about the movie I don't like and that's all thanks to\nJames Cameron. I think it's amazing that Arnie was able to go from\nuber-villain in the original Terminator to uber-hero in the sequel\nwhilst playing exactly the same character basically. I realise that\nhe's a robot but I don't think anyone else could've played that part\nand Arnie excels here. As a now 32 year old man I know I'm supposed to\nbe all tough and hardened but the ending ALWAYS makes me cry and I'm\nnot ashamed about it. Totally amazing.\n"},
{"review": "\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day is a perfection. The action and sci-fi\nelements go together like bread and butter. It also contains some of\nthe greatest action sequences in film history, but that doesn't stop it\nfrom having a deep storyline. The characters go through changes, the\ndialogue is razor sharp, and the acting is wonderful. Arnold gives the\nbest performance in his career. The jokes are often funny. Moments with\nThe Terminator talking to John Conner are just as good at times as the\nbig action sequences. The effects were groundbreaking at the time. The\nscore is fantastic.

{"review": "\nWritten and directed of course by James Cameron, the 1991 sequel to The\nTerminator takes place eleven years on from its predecessor.

I personally find it impossible to look at\nCameron's sequel as a 'film' to critique because it's simply so much\ngreater than the confines of the silver screen. I'm currently sat with\na tepid coffee, trying my best to conjure the brilliance of this epic\nand even with the worlds most extensive thesaurus I'd fail to do it\njustice.<br><br>Casting aside the sheer admiration I have for Cameron's ability to\nintertwine science fiction, action and romance so poetically, it's the\noverwhelming character the film has to offer that I feel sets it so far\nabove the rest. Whether it's Cameron's off-hue blue-lit depiction of\nLA, Brad Fiedel's tragically heart-warming score, Robert Patrick's icy\ndemeanour, Arnie's stoical charm or the final brutally touching words\nof Linda Hamilton, Terminator 2 simply oozes with a unique and\nunmatchable style, character and timelessness.<br><br>-10/10\n"},

When I watched\nTerminator 2 for the first time, I didn't understand anything, because\nI was new to English, but after re-watching it, I was completely amazed\nby what I missed out on. Terminator 2 is 50x better than it's\npredecessor even though that is good, but still it could not beat\nTerminator 2.<br><br>An evil terminator (Robert Patrick) is sent back from the future to\nterminate John Connor (Edward Furlong), who will later rise an uprising\nagainst the machines, and the terminator will do anything to stop John\nfrom living.
