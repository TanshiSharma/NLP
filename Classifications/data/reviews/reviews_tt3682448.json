Bridge of Spies is literally\nabout the Cold War Bridge of Spies, where Soviet/US spies were\nexchanged through negotiations.

And based on my\npreliminary research, they seem to be getting most of their facts\nright. Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake, Bridge\nof Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama. There is a lot of\ntalking, but it's meaningful talking. At times, the film can be a\nlittle slow {opening scene, especially}, but give it a chance and you\nmight enjoy it. History buffs like myself will definitely enjoy it.

{"review": "\nBridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks,\nco-written by the Coen brothers, and directed by Steven Spielberg. Even\nthough its subject matter of the Cold War is something I know very\nlittle about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than\never to learn more about it. I rank it among the best of Spielberg's\nmost recent movies.<br><br>In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during\nthe Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and\nSoviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and\neach side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified\ninformation from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is\narrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom\nHanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of\ndefending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and\ndifficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an\nAmerican spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured\nby the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring\ncountries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war,\nAbel for Powers.<br><br>Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely\nmade up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is\nmost likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven\nSpielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments\nwhere it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong\nand that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another\nmemorable performance as James B. Donovan, once again proving his\nversatility as an actor.<br><br>I rate it 8.5/10.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Everyone deserves a defense. Everyone matters.\" James B. Donovan (Tom\nHanks)<br><br>In Bridge of Spies, Steven Spielberg once again masterfully goes to the\nhistorical drama with a righteous man's theme (think Schindler and\nLincoln for starters). This time lawyer James B. Donovan is asked to\ndefend an accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Able (Mark Rylance, superb), in\norder to show the world the American justice system is democratic. <br><br>The story is \"inspired by true events\" with the outline of the exchange\nof Able for U-2 downed pilot Gary Powers historically accurate. As\nusual, Spielberg recreates the times with the atmosphere, cars, and\nfilm noir aspect of a spy thriller in the figurative and literal Cold\nWar. He said, \"I always wanted to tell the stories that really\ninterested me in my personal life\u0097which are stories about things that\nactually happened.\"<br><br>Hanks is central to Spielberg's vision of the lone hero defying the\nodds and supporting the highest ideals of the American Constitution and\nthe individually virtuous man. Never does Hanks overplay the good-guy\ncard; he's just very adept at playing an everyman not always right but\nalways righteous. <br><br>The dialogue is crisp, a no fooling around typical of Spielberg and\nHanks but a charming bad guy as well: James Donovan: \"Aren't you\nworried?\" Rudolf Abel: \"Would it help?\" As producer Kristie Macosko\nKrieger commented about Spielberg, \"He's got a childlike sense of\nwonder. He never gets tired of hearing stories . . . . \" Bridge of\nSpies is vintage Spielberg with a Lincoln-like atmosphere, righteous\nhero, and intriguing multi-plot, an entertaining spy story brimming\nwith humanity. <br><br>As the director says, \"This is more about very smart people in\nconversation with each other, and the sword of Damocles hanging over\ntheir heads is that, if they make the wrong decisions, it's the end of\nthe world.\"\n"},
{"review": "\nBridge Of Spies is a well acted, thrilling, smart Cold War drama that\nfeatures a Oscar worthy performance from Tom hanks. Bridge of Spies\ntells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of\ntension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that\nwhen films can capture that tone it's usually special, that being said\nthe film doesn't quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks\nperformance, and Spielberg's seasoned direction manage to save the\nfilm. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either\nhumor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar\nnomination. In the end Bridge of Spies isn't as good as it could have\nbeen, but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get\nplenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards.\n"},

It is unnecessary to\ncomment the direction of Steven Spielberg and the performance of Tom\nHanks, perfect as usual, but it is impressive the capacity of\nnegotiation of James B. Donovan.

{"review": "\nMark Rylance stands out as the best reason to watch this movie. And, I\nfeel tempted to say, the only reason to do so. His lines take the cream\nof the screenplay.

{"review": "\nHanks, Alda, Spielberg, the Coen brothers. What can go wrong?\nApparently, quite a lot.<br><br>Strengths first: the meticulous recreation of the 60's across two\ncountries is breathtaking. The streets look 60's, the people look and\ntalk 60's, the atmosphere is 60's. It's immersing and awe-inspiring.<br><br>Now the weaknesses: 1) Lots and lots of exposition. I understand that\nthe millenials are expected to not know the history from 50 years ago,\nbut come on - if someone doesn't know/love history they aren't going to\nsee this movie in the first place. Stop wasting our time with\nexposition. 2) Poor acting. This must be the weakest performance from\nTom Hanks I've seen in years. The guy is sleep-walking through the\nrole, and everyone else is wooden and not worth mentioning, except for\nAlan Alda who steals every scene he's in. Amy Ryan is just awful I'm\nsorry to say. 3) Too long. Way too long. Should've ended with the\nexchange taking place. We don't need the \"happy end\" through\nvindication - it's completely implausible too. 4) Not focused. The\npilot's story is completely surplus to requirements and insignificant -\nit doesn't add anything to the narrative. We don't really need to see\nthe pilot until his first scene in captivity. Instead, the time should\nbe spent on character development of which there is absolutely none. 5)\nPredictable. Yes, the story is well known and we all know how it ends,\nbut this means that the unpredictability needs to be in the nuances.\nThe little things that aren't part of the written history. But\neverything is predictable, nothing is captivating. 6) The treatment of\nthe story. The script is by the Coen brothers but it has John Le Carre\nwritten all over it. It's a classic Le Carre-like spy thriller\n(thriller, not action). There have been fantastic film adaptations of\nLe Carre, so we know it can be done. Sadly, on this occasion Spielberg\nfails to deliver.<br><br>4/10\n"},

The treatment of Francis Gary\nPowers is completely superficial, which makes the story even weaker.\nFor an audience not familiar with the history surrounding Abel and\nPowers, this movie will not make any sense at all. This movie contains\nno heroes, heroines, no damsels in distress, none of the stock\ncharacters and situations usually employed to give a story some\nsubstance.

We manage to gain support from the spy as we see\nhis point of view, beautifully captured by the great Steven Spielberg. <br><br>On the other hand, I did feel that it did not give us enough insight on\nthe seriousness of the Cold War. There is a scene where Donovan views a\nbunch of people being shot down while travelling on a train, I would\nlike to to have seen more of this, to emphasise the struggles this\nmovie is dealing with. <br><br>The performances are the highlight of it all, Tom Hanks is breathtaking\nas the lead role, James Donovan, perfectly conveying the transformation\nof an everyday lawyer turned hero, and Mark Rylance delivers a well\ndeserved Oscar win as Rudolf Abel, a flawed, conflicted character who\nwe can not help but support as a result of Rylance's charm. Terrificly\nacted, superb direction and a great script, Bridge of Spies is\ncertainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama. <br><br>An insurance lawyer is tasked with defending a Soviet spy, a job that\nends up stretching far beyond the courtroom. <br><br>Best Performance: Tom Hanks / Worst Performance: Alan Alda\n"},
{"review": "\nSo this is a talking movie, with a LOT of talking going around without\nmuch action. Actually there is almost no action at all. So if you are\nlooking forward to watching a action movie with spies going on\nespionage and trying to assassinate people, this isn't that kind of\nmovie. When it comes to talking movies, the story, the dialogue and the\nperformances has to take center stage. And this movie has all three of\nthose elements without it going to a very convoluted and overly\npolitical direction. So most mainstream audiences will understand what\nis going on, on screen. However for me, what made this movie really\nwork is Steven Spielberg classic direction. Where the premise is\nuplifting while having a sense of humanity. The cinematography really\ndoes have the tenacity to keep audiences like me focused for the most\npart. This is a historical film that is based on a true story. So the\nplot is about James B. Donovan played by Tom Hanks who is a lawyer that\ntakes on the task of defending a soviet spy. And the negotiation and\nwhat goes behind the scenes of the American and Soviet politics. It\ndelves into humanity and the will power to stand up for what is right,\nalthough a lot of people will resent you for it. Although this isn't a\nmovie I would sit through the whole thing again, it was well worth the\nwatch.<br><br>8/10\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a compelling character study set amid the espionage and drama\nof the Cold War between America and the Soviets. What really got my\nattention was when part of James Donovan's (Tom Hanks) argument against\nthe death penalty for Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) relied\nlargely on foreseeing the day when an American might be arrested on\nsimilar charges, and a live prisoner might be the key to an exchange.\nCold War paranoia is more than evident in the early part of the story,\nDonovan's own son asks him, \"You're not a Communist, so why are you\ndefending one\"? <br><br>It's not made clear how much Donovan's pressure impacted the judge in\nsentencing Abel, who early on insisted this was an open and shut case,\nwith Donovan's court strategy merely window dressing. I was surprised\nhow little time was offered for Francis Gary Powers' (Austin Stowell)\nrole in the film, but that apparently was not the emphasis of the\nstory. I was only six years old when these events unfolded but somehow\n(amazingly) can recall Powers' name in headlines of the day.<br><br>There's always a question about historical accuracy with films like\nthis, but that shouldn't sway one's interest in seeing the picture. The\nstory is gripping and does a good job in demonstrating Donovan's\nresolve to protect his client's rights while remaining faithful to the\nprinciples of the Constitution. His reaction to East Germans being shot\nat the Berlin Wall attempting to escape was an unsubtle reminder that\neven though the events depicted occurred over a half century ago, they\nstill resonate strongly with viewers who were alive at the time.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe bar association asks insurance lawyer James B. Donovan to defend a\nsuspected Russian spy arrested on American soil. When an American spy\nis captured Donovan becomes a negotiator for two of the world powers to\nagree the prisoners release.<br><br>With the film based on real-life events writers Matt Charman, Joel and\nEthan Coen turns a secret prisoner exchange between the CIA and the KGB\ninto a tense and often humorous cat-and-mouse game. Suffering with a\ncold, quick thinking breifcase touting Tom Hanks' law-abiding lead\ncharacter Donovan is gripping as he is used as a go between by his own\ngovernment with German and Russian officials. Hanks brings an everyday\nman vulnerability, akin to Michael Caines' Harry Palmer to the role. <br><br>Steven Spielberg offers a finely crafted Cold War espionage thriller,\nwonderfully recreating the Cold War era thanks to clever special\neffects. The stakes are high, you witness the Berlin Wall being built,\nit's an appealing diplomatic film. There are tense moments littered\nthroughout, notably when Donovan is tasked in defending a Russian spy\nin a court of law, the backlash from his community and the danger he\nputs his family carries an impact.<br><br>Its a fine production. Bridge of Spies is interesting throughout and it\nsurprisingly captures some old fashion Hollywood magic.\n"},
{"review": "\nI finally watched this Steven Spielberg-directed drama starring Tom\nHanks on Netflix disc with my mom just now. We were both enthralled by\nthis based on a true story of Hanks' James Donovan-an insurance lawyer\nwho previously was involved in the Nuremberg trials-and his attempt to\nfirst defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance who gave a\nperformance worthy of his Oscar win) and then fostering an exchange\nwith Russia and East Germany to trade Abel for pilot Francis Gary\nPowers and student Frederic Pryor, respectively. It was fascinating\nfinding out later how much of the movie was historically accurate,\nturns out quite a bit. Some scenes would be considered shocking but\nthis was mostly carried by compelling dialogue of which much of it was\nby Joel and Ethan Coen. So on that note, me and Mom highly recommend\nBridge of Spies.\n"},
{"review": "\nBut it's either a very big gap or a very big bridge (or maybe both). So\nto some this may feel too long.

Haven't read much about that, but the\nmovie may take a couple of people to take a look into that. And for\nthat, the movie achieved what it wanted: Putting a spotlight on\nsomething not many are aware of.

{"review": "\nI like films about spies, especially those are based on actual events.\nThis film is one of the greatest. It tells the story very clear and\nfantastic.

I\nthink the lawyer Donawin is magnificent and he really changes the\nworld. The exchange is successful, and his fame improves. I hope that I\ncan watch more espionage films like that, such films can take us inside\nthe secretive, interesting, amazing world of spies.

I was so wrong and for\nthe better of it.<br><br>Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor and he plays the role of a simple lawyer\nbeing dragged into an unfamiliar situation with a huge amount of\nconfidence and bravery. He fights for what he believes is right and\nplays both sides ( the Germans and the Russians) perfectly.

There is something in his eyes and\nthe way he talks, it just pins you down and you just have to focus on\nhim. Of course, the camera work in the movie is excellent and it really\nputs you right inside the action - especially in the second part of the\nmovie.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis Cold War thriller confirms two things about director Steven\nSpielberg.<br><br>One: he is among the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema.\nIt's amazing how he makes every sequence visually interesting, fluid\nand well-paced, from dialogue scenes (which represent the bulk of\nBridge of Spies) to action set-pieces (here just a brief plane crash\nsequence). He gets strong performances from his actors, here Tom Hanks,\nAmy Ryan and Mark Rylance, the latter in an Award-winning turn as a\nmild-mannered Soviet spy. The director's efficiency on set is legendary\n- Bridge of Spies looks great in spite of a slim (for Hollywood\nstandards!) forty millions budget. Spielberg was just born to narrate\nstories.<br><br>And that's why his films, even those I don't particularly like or\nflat-out detest (The Lost World), usually still have *something* worth\nrecommending.<br><br>Two: Spielberg's movies have diabetes.

Bridge of\nSpies would be greatly improved by excising (or radically altering) the\nlast five-ten minutes, much like War of the Worlds, AI, Saving Private\nRyan, Schindler's List, Minority Report. Looking back at it, it's\nsurprising the director delivered in Raiders of the Lost Ark one of the\nmost memorably ironic epilogues ever.<br><br>And that's why I prefer Spielberg's more lighthearted fare, like Jaws\nor Jurassic Park; in serious movies, his fluffy endings are more\ngrating and inappropriate.<br><br>Overall, Bridge of Spies is a solid effort.

{"review": "\nHanks and Spielberg tackle a Cold War spy-exchange against the backdrop\nof a freshly-constructed Berlin Wall. As one might expect from these\nold masters, it's expertly-crafted and loaded with gravitas; a warm,\nmotivated take on a surprisingly under-explored chapter of recent\nhistory. It does a great job of delicately re-evaluating popular\nsentiment and the bullish nature of post-war international relations,\ntoo, painting heroes and victims on both sides of the dispute. The plot\nis very linear, though, moving on a predictable set of rails from start\nto finish, and that can make it feel preachy when a few of the more\nheavy-handed themes briefly overstay their welcome. A\nfoundationally-strong, workmanlike offering, it's 50%\ndesperately-uphill legal drama and 50% high stakes poker with a set of\ncaptive American souls as the ante.\n"},
{"review": "\nMark Rylance is really really good. I can't believe he hasn't been in\nany big movies before and wish to see him again. As for the movie, well\nit isn't a Schindler's List and won't feature in Spielberg's top 10.\nNor is it a Tom Hank's top ten. It's a regular cold war time movie that\nis biographical and based on the life of James Donovan who was\ninstrumental in prisoner exchange during the cold war and the Bay of\nPigs invasion. It's an interesting story giving an important\nperspective on the cold war. I enjoyed watching the movie, but it could\nhave fleshed out the characters of Pryor and Powers some more. Both of\nthem were unknown actors (seemed like) and their roles totally\nforgettable. The folks from Russia and East Germany also were\nforgettable to say the least.

{"review": "\nBridge of Spies is an excellent movie. It is based on a true story and\nshowcases the tumultuous political intricacies that are involved in\nespionage. Although it is based in the past and espionage has no doubt\nundergone massive change the political aspects of espionage always\nremain extremely delicate. There is no doubt that situations can be\nresolved or escalate depending on the actions of a few men. Tom Hanks\nis truly excellent as the 'standing man'. He is a straight down the\nmiddle man who believes in his country's constitution and believes in\njustice. He is prepared to stand up for it at any cost. He is the\nmovie's hero and is wisely understated as so rather than over\ncelebrated. His performance should have stole the show however Mark\nRylance (who I had never encountered before) gives a truly memorable\nperformance as Rudolf Abel. He is indifferent in the face of danger and\nresigned to playing his part as a pawn in a bigger game. Every moment\nhe is on screen is true acting brilliance, and mesmerizing to watch. As\nin many espionage thrillers there are a few twists and turns right up\nuntil the end. This movie makes you think about the real life people\nwho have put everything on the line for something bigger. People who\nknow how it could end but carry on regardless in service of their\ncountry. People who carry out the dirty work of bigger powers and may\nnever have been remembered for it.

What is surprising\nthough is that Spielberg confirmed in a BBC interview he had no\npolitical message in this one. That is curious to say the least, with\nall the abundant contemporary parallels like Snowden for Abel in the\nstory, or drones for the U2 back then. His reply was 'it is just a\nbloody good story'.

The result would then have been much more\npowerful and less preachy. His choice is all the more peculiar, since\nhe did not shy away showing us uncompromising battle scenes in Saving\nPrivate Ryan, but perhaps it was also helping us realize that was\nindeed a deserved accolade for what America has done for the world.\nSpielberg is, as IMDb says, indeed one of the most influential figures\nof cinema, and he deserves this for his many film making qualities as\nalso this movie shows us again.

Donovan is an insurance lawyer who was asked to defend an\naccused spy Rudolf Abel,who was caught in some illegal activities in\nthe United States.The prosecutors were thinking that he will not take\nthe case seriously amidst the Cold War.But apparently he did.Despite of\nbeing proved guilty,he avoided the death penalty for his\nclient.Also,Donovan tried his best to defend Abel up to appealing his\ncase in the Supreme Court.<br><br>Years after,Donovan was asked to negotiate for the release of Francis\nGary Powers,an American spy was caught in the USSR after the U2 pilot\nplane was shot down.They did this through an exchange of spies with the\nUnited States releasing Abel and the Soviets releasing Powers.Aside\nfrom that,Donovan also worked for the release of Frederic Pryor,an\nAmerican economics graduate student,who was visiting his German\ngirlfriend in East Berlin. <br><br>The film was interesting.No question about it.While the film had an\nunderstated impact,the unpredictability of the characters kept the\nmovie interesting from beginning to end.It was nice to see a something\nwherein friendship is developed among people who wouldn't trust each\nother.As for the performances,Tom Hanks could be considered superb.But\nMark Rylance definitely deserves an Academy Award nomination for being\ngreat as the Soviet spy Abel.As for Spielberg,he still remains the best\ndirector when it comes using visual images in telling the story.This\ndeserves the highest rating.\n"},
{"review": "\nName every aspect involving making a film and thumbs go up with this\none.The master speaks, uses his skills to the sublime. No one doubts.\nSpielberg at his best. Right?<br><br>Yes, but...<br><br>1/3 courtroom, 2/3 cold war suspense. Thats a rough outline of the\nscrips structure. The latter would be deeply satisfying for it's\nexiting, sentimentally old- fashion, home- cooked cold-war-spy-movie\ngrandeur. But it is not satisfying to me. Why? Because there is a 1/3\ncourtroom part that is so much more, so much more promising, so much\nmore layered, with so many exiting set-ups, that i miss - i miss him\nmore often these days - good old Clint Eatwood to bring all that\ncomplexity to a satisfying end. The first part is not about cold war,\nnot about a spy and not about court. The fist part is about.....us. Us\npeople in modern days turmoil , caught in the middle of international\nterrorist fear. In the middle of fear for Muslims, in the middle of\nfear for 'the other' human being, in the middle of group pressure,\nconsensus, media hysteria, etc..... The first part is showing a hero\nwho thinks for himself, who is not giving in to group- thinking, who\ndares to stand alone, who uses reason in the right way, who is a hero\nbecause he keeps his brain sound and clear, his private property, not\nowned by Apple, Google or God knows who..... All in the setting of the\n50s. This 1/3 part promises a movie that uses a cold war concept to dig\ndeeper into the psychology of group thinking and the harmful\nconsequences of it.<br><br>Instead, we turn to a good old spy movie, Spielberg forgets his\nmillion-dollar worth set-ups, leaves us alone with the moral\nexpectations we developed and gives us goodies and baddies....with a\ntwist, sure, but......<br><br>Americans that think, act straight and...... Eurpoeans that act weird\nand confused.<br><br>Great movie to watch, because it is nothing more than great popcorn. My\nfavorite is white ceddar cheese btw...\n"},
{"review": "\n\"What's the next move when you don't know what the game is.\" James B.\nDonovan (Hanks) is an insurance lawyer who has been chosen to defend a\nRussian accused of being a spy. He manages to make the entire country,\nincluding his firm, upset with him by the time the trial is over. After\na US pilot is captured the US wants to facilitate an exchange of\nprisoners. Once again Donovan is enlisted to help, but his plans are\ndifferent than what the government wants. First thing, this is a great\nmovie. I really enjoyed this and was entertained by it the entire time.\nI will say there isn't a lot of action in this and the movie really had\nthe feel of Lincoln. To me that's not a bad thing but just a heads up.\nHanks is good as usual and really brings compassion to this role. The\nfact that this is based on true events makes the movie that much more\nexciting and tense. This is a movie that I highly recommend, but again\nmay not be for everyone. Overall, Hanks and Spielberg hit another home\nrun. For a history buff like me this was one of the best movies of the\nyear. I give this a B+.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen Spielberg is behind the cameras you know you're going to watch a\nmovie which is at least correct. Luckily, Bridge of Spies is more than\ncorrect: it's a remarkable film from start to finish.<br><br>Its strenghts are the great staging, the dark and cold photography and\nthe rock-solid acting. There is nothing more to be said about Tom\nHanks, he is able to make crappy films like Da Vinci Code entertaining,\nso in a good movie like this one, it's obvious he nails it. I've loved\nthe other main character, Mark Rylance as the Russian spy. He transmits\ncomposure no matter what is going around him. The ties that bind his\ncharacter to Hanks' one trascend the main plot and send a bright\nmessage: people have essentially the same values, and if we are\nconfronted is just because of the part of the board we started from\nwhen we were born.<br><br>Its weaknesses, well... no risks taken. The plot is predictable and\nbased in values overused in cinema like friendship, loyalty and\nhonesty. Even the cinematography: after so many movies Spielberg knows\nhimself too well, and his way of managing the resources seems obvious.\nDon't get me wrong, that is great because with an interesting story we\nhave an interesting movie, but far from that feeling of novelty that\nmakes a film special. To be precise: there are shots which feel like\ncopy-paste from other of his movies (those scenes with headlights in\nbacklighting, those slow chases, those cars moving and braking to stop\nin front of the camera...) and the pace is sometimes quite slow (there\nare scenes in which Spielberg shows the exact same thing from different\nangles, adding really nothing to the movie but redundant information).\nBut anyway, it's an enjoyable movie. In fact the best from Spielberg\nlately.\n"},
{"review": "\nSteven Spielberg is one of the best directors of all time with his\nmassive and mostly amazing filmography this was one of my most\nanticipated movies of 2015 and it lived up to most expectations. Tom\nhanks is fantastic in this movie he is instantly likable as he is set\nup from the first scene as an honourable and hard working man. But my\ngod Mark Rylance was outstanding in this movie, he stole every scene he\nwas in and his \"Standing Man\" speech is one of the best monologues of\nthe year. The era of the Cold War was very well done as it was clear\nhow many people hated the soviets in this movie and also made for a lot\nof very intense moments and gave the impression that things could fall\napart at any moment. Like most of Spielberg films Bridge of Spies is\nsuperbly directed with most of the scenes are long cuts, tracking shots\nand close ups. It could have been very easy in a dialogue driven film\nlike to cut a lot but Spielberg doesn't fall for it. This film is not\nwithout its flaws, for one Powers' are in this movie was slow and\nhonestly unnecessary as looking back at Savung Private Ryan the person\nthey were trying to save in that movie didn't even make an appearance\nuntil 2/3 of the way through and that type of decision would also have\nworked very well for this movie. The film also suffers from a slow\npaced second half. With certain obstacles becoming a bit silly and\ndrawn out and being a bit repetitive after a while. The ending however\nwas just perfect for what it needed to be. Not without its flaws but\nstill a great movie and another Spielberg classic. <br><br>8.5/10 A-\n"},

{"review": "\nIt has been a while since we have been blessed with something from the\nlegendary Steven Spielberg and Bridge of Spies certainly does not\ndisappoint. I do not think this is one of Spielberg's greatest films\n(It's kind of hard to become of those), however I do believer this film\nis surely high on the list. Bridge of Spies brings light on the Cold\nWar, an event that most audiences do not know much about. The Cold War\ndid not have much action associated with it and neither does Bridge of\nSpies. Nonetheless, this film was highly entertaining and had me glued\nto my seat. Everything flowed together perfectly. These days actors are\nperform at a high level and most films have moving performances from\neveryone they cast. Bridges of Spies was no exception to this. Tom\nHanks has yet to let me down in a film and Mark Rylance looks like he\nneeds to be cast in a lot more films. The only thing negative I have to\nsay about the film is that it is very predictable. But with great\ndirecting, superb on screen performances, and well written dialogues,\nBridge of Spies is among the best films of 2015.\n"},
{"review": "\nHanks plays lawyer and former counsel for the OSS who represents Soviet\nspy Rudolph Abel on espionage charges, and is then asked to broker a\ndeal permitting Abel to return to Russia for the release of Francis\nGary Powers, captured U-2 spy plane pilot. I have a natural distrust of\nSpielberg, most recently from the fictional War Horse, for being overly\nmanipulative with his audiences. I have checked the basic facts behind\nthis movie and they appear legit. If the movie was confirmed on a few\nother points I would give this a 10 without reservation. Sorry, for me\nhistorical movies (and particularly Biblical movies) need to be\naccurate - subtle deviations from the truth can (to me) create false\nimpressions. As it is Hanks and Rylance (as Abel) are just superb,\nHanks seems made for Spielberg's sort of movies. The period work is\nvery impressive and cinematography superb. The story starts slowly but\nonce things get going it moves along very well. This has the feel of\nOscar work, just an impressive movie.\n"},

{"review": "\n'Bridge Of Spies' is a really cool drama movie with intriguing\nscreenplay.Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap,\nduring the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia.The movie is\nvery realistic.

{"review": "\nI prepared myself for the slow and steady spy-craft of Steven\nSpielberg's Bridge of Spies and got to watch another strong performance\nfrom Tom Hanks.<br><br>I was not familiar with this piece of history but apparently this\ninsurance lawyer, James B. Donovan, had quite an effect on U.S. foreign\nnegotiations during the Cold War. I can't help thinking there were some\nother stories to tell and should do some research on why Spielberg\nchose this particular story to adapt into a motion picture. There was\ncertainly historical significance to the events depicted and I alway\nlike to be made to think and to learn. <br><br>It looked beautiful, shots, scenery, costumes, but I did notice it was\njust a bunch of white guys for the most part and a few minor roles for\nwoman. I have been reading Hollywood has a problem with that but it's\nnot like this movie set out to change that and I guess they were just\ndisplaying the times. <br><br>There were also some great supporting performances by Mark Rylance, as\nRussian spy Rudolf Abel, and Amy Ryan, who played Donovan's wife and\nwas also the mother in the recent Goosebumps movie. Someone should give\nher a leading role. I liked her all the way back in The Wire. Scott\nShepherd was also good as a CIA agent.<br><br>This movie hinges on Hanks performance and I had no doubt he would\ndeliver. He especially excels in the final climactic scenes. I liked\nthis movie but it was also a bit slow and doesn't necessarily need to\nbe seen in theaters. This is the fourth collaboration between Tom Hanks\nand Steven Spielberg after Saving Private Ryan (one of the greatest war\nmovies ever), The Terminal (forgettable), and Catch Me If You Can\n(another great movie).

{"review": "\nSet in the Cold War era, in Brooklyn, Bridge of Spies is a story about\na successful insurance prosecutor, James B Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is\ngiven a case to defend a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). A\ntrue nationalist and yet an idealist lawyer, James draw a lot of flak\nfrom his men for his earnest and professional efforts in the case. But\nsoon, his ideology leads him to a precarious task of rescuing an\nAmerican pilot, a task gravely sensitive for the two conflicting\nnations. The movie is not a nail biting thriller which the title or the\ntrailer or Saving Private Ryan might have suggested. This is a very\nevenly paced drama, predictable for most of the time but boasts of\nmeticulous details, a hallmark of Mr Spielberg. The story is inherently\na little weak, yet Mr Spielberg manages to spin off a decent movie out\nof it. James and Rudolf really hit it off and it is fun to watch them\ntogether. Tom Hanks is at his usual best and Mark Rylance befits the\ncharacter of an extraordinarily wise, artistic and resolute Russian\nsoldier. Other characters are not of much significance and a couple of\nthem actually seem needless. The movie follows a depiction of the event\nas it happened and doesn't display any deliberate dramatization.\nConsequently, it doesn't evoke any strong emotions while watching which\nsome people might actually prefer. Personally, I believe a better\nconnect and impact would have made this movie far more memorable. This\ndefinitely is a decent, American film which scores completely on\nactors, cinematography (involving 1960 Brooklyn) and direction. But\nconsidering what Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks have done before, I had\nstomach for more.\n"},

{"review": "\nOK, Bridge Of Spies. Long (141 mins) and boring spy thriller with the\nusual performance from Tom Hanks (James Donovan) who's face throughout\nthe middle of the movie looks like a carrot due to the the bad makeup\nand in the other half has the usual-suspect- grimace if he is having a\npoo because of too much effort trying to convince us with his tricks in\na particular scene. The story is ...hm \"based on a true story\" which\ncan't save it from superficiality. Mark Rylance who plays Rudolf Abel\nis much more interesting/convincing as an actor but also struggle in\nthe adapted screenplay so whoever did it better not do it again.The\nIron Curtain/Berlin Wall is very much Hollywood and you have seen it in\nmany other movies so you are already prepared for it and will not\nsurprise you.

{"review": "\nBridge of Spies had an amazing display of sincere and authentic care\nfor your enemies. The display of love for your enemies in this movie is\na great example of who we are supposed to be in Christ when we struggle\nto do the right thing against our sin nature. For when we love our\nenemies, our friends may hate us for it, but we can be assured in who\nwe are in Christ by not backing down in our character and convictions\neven if the crowd demands our head.

But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who\npersecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven.\"\nCharacter is also greatly displayed in Donovan's character throughout\nthe movie.

{"review": "\nTo start off, Tom Hank's acting was spot on.

The movie could have been shortened to an\nhour an a half, in my humble opinion.

Alas, this film hinted at the depth of\ntheir relationship but could have showed so much more.<br><br>Rather, like a parasitic over-the-top twin, the movie within a movie\ninterrupted the story.

By the end of 1952 all US air\nforce personnel were required to wear blue uniforms so that the period\nof 1957-60 would not have seen the uniforms that props issued to the\nactors playing the pilots.
