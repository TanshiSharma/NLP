{"review": "\nIf your idea of funny is excessive unnecessary profanity (it seems\nalmost every line in the film contains it) inserted instead of actual\nhumor, uninspired sex jokes, gross images with no pay off, and lame\nsatire, then you may enjoy Sausage Party.<br><br>Allegedly, the inspiration for making this movie was the creators'\ndesire to make the first \"adult\" 3D animated film.

But that's just it. There\naren't really any jokes in this movie. Punchlines here are usually\nsomeone dropping an f-bomb. If you are not 11 years old, you may want\nsomething more. Visual gags are sometimes interesting, but do not\ninduce laughter. The animation is well done and there are many\ncelebrity voices involved, all of whom act well, but to what end?<br><br>Anyone familiar with the sort of movies Seth Rogen ends up in (toilet,\nsex, and drug humor) then you will have a fair idea of how this pans\nout. There are characters taking drugs and talking about \"getting\nbaked.\" HA! HA! Items from the grocery store make crude remarks and\nsimulate sex acts. HA! HA! Many of the characterizations simply involve\npeople yelling a lot. HA! HA! There's brutal violence. HA!

{"review": "\nOkay, to start this off: this movie is definitely NOT for kids. It\ndefinitely deserves its R-rating. Sausage Party is one of those movies\nthat will make you say: what the hell am I watching?<br><br>To be frank(see what I did there?), this movie fulfilled every bit of\nexpectation I had, no more and no less in its \"well, I think I've seen\nenough\" factor. What I mean by that, is that this is the most vulgar\nand xenophobic animated movie I've ever seen but in a good way. As\nobnoxious as this movie is, I can't help but giggle half the time when\nI'm watching it, even though how disgusting and indecent some of the\nscenes are, especially at the end. And mostly because of that, I will\nnever see food the same way ever again(the animation is pretty good\nthough).<br><br>Maybe my only true complaint about this movie was the ending, since it\nseems it was just tacked in there \"just because\" but to be fair, the\nmovie was already weird as it is. So yeah, the ending for me felt kinda\nrandom and I feel that it should've ended in that particular scene\nbefore it but overall, I don't think it won't affect what most people\nthought about this film. Though I expect that this movie will offend a\nlot of people but to hell with that! let your immature side take over\nfor a while and enjoy this film about food getting it on and on and\non..... and on.<br><br>If you like humor that is both weird and outrageously crass but still\nremotely funny, then look no further since Sausage Party is the movie\nfor you.\n"},

{"review": "\nSo this is the animated movie that came out of nowhere and got a bunch\nof people of talking all because of it's trailer. Let me tell you right\nnow, the red-band trailer for this movie is funnier than the movie\nitself. And the whole reason the trailer made me laugh was because at\nfirst it looks like a regular animated movie, then the swearing and sex\njokes happen. Speaking of which, this movie is nothing but swearing and\nsex jokes, oh and stereotypes. Because writing personalities for\nanimated characters is so difficult, almost every character is just a\nwalking stereotype. The bagel's Jewish, the lavash is Muslim, the\nsauerkraut is a Nazi, are you laughing yet?!? That is the extent of\nthis movies \"humor\", it is literally just that. So if you think\nswearing and sex jokes is the pinnacle of comedy, then this'll be the\nfunniest movie you've ever seen. However, if you're above the age of\n14, then this movie will just exist, exist and not be funny in the\nslightest. This movie only made me chuckle twice, I laughed more during\n\"The Theory of Everything\", and I'm pretty sure that movie wasn't a\nfreakin' comedy!!! This is without a doubt the worst animated movie\nI've seen, and it's a shame that actors like Edward Norton had to be in\nit. I can't wait for the eventual sequel where all the food comes to\nthe real world and interacts with their voice actors, won't that be\nhilarious?! Does anybody else think that the makers of this movie paid\noff top critics to give this positive reviews? Because I honestly can't\nunderstand why anyone who's old enough to see an R-rated movie would\nfind this funny at all.\n"},

The\nvoice acting is pretty good even if some voices felt weird over their\nrespective characters. It was interesting to see how lip syncing worked\nwith food. Each and every single character is fun and unique and while\nthey fall into stereotypes they still do great job making you laugh and\ndriving the story.

You NEED to shut your brain of because if you even think for a\nsecond about the movement, the plot and some moments you would turn it\noff instantly.

{"review": "\nIf your idea of funny is excessive unnecessary profanity (it seems\nalmost every line in the film contains it) inserted instead of actual\nhumor, uninspired sex jokes, gross images with no pay off, and lame\nsatire, then you may enjoy Sausage Party. good tip, don't watch with\nyour sister and father like den Toni... it makes for awkwardest\nsituation (like that one where the bagel covers his eyes ;) )\nAllegedly, the inspiration for making this movie was the creators'\ndesire to make the first \"adult\" 3D animated film.

I really believe there\nshould be a specific and separate warning for \"cartoon\" films that say\n\"not suitable for children\", kinda like Camel Joe for the tobacco\nindustry. The R rating just isn't enough. No one pays attention to\nthose anymore because there is not always a definition to the warning.\nSo which is more harmful, violence, nudity, drug use or perverted\nbehavior, etc. I believe my daughter would have been traumatized by\nwatching and \"listening\" to this movie. Fortunately my daughter is very\ngood about accepting my guidance as to what is appropriate and would\nnot watch this without my permission. But I worry about other kids that\nmight be drawn to and get access to this film, and you can't always\ndump it off on the individual parent. It takes a village. This type of\nfilm has no business being advertised like any other animated cartoon\nmovie. Its a crappy movie and the humor is only funny if your a\ndeviant.

While much of the surprise in the individual jokes is\ngone in favor of broader concepts, Sausage Party still works, thanks to\nits comedic thoughts on faith and prejudice. It's a mixture of foody\nand racist puns that, while far from consistent, provide plenty of easy\nlaughs.

Its\nsurprising main ingredient is its interest in social pigeonholing;\nthink Zootopia without the cute animals and family-friendliness.\nThoughtless religion and selfish bigotry are on abundant display,\nincluding a hilarious opening song (akin to the worst of modern\nevangelical music) and a straight-up explanation of our tendency to\ncompartmentalize people with religion and race.

It does contain many stereotypes of all kinds, and it\neven has a rape scene (yes, a rape scene), but it's a film that\nactually condemns hate, and all of the pointless rules religion gives\nus that prevent us from doing what we enjoy, or even inspire hatred.\nThe film says that since death and hatred and racism and violence are\nrampant among the human race, we should stop hating others for their\ndifferences and rather unite as one human race, and just have one big\norgy. Okay, that last part is only partially true, but that's basically\nthe point. We focus so much on our separate beliefs and versions of the\nafterlife and how to get there, that maybe we forget to just enjoy our\nlife on earth.<br><br>Aside from that message, it also has some seriously detailed animation,\nand some clever visual humor, which is something we don't get enough\nthese days, and one of the strongest arguments for the fact that\nanything can be funny in certain context. To top it all off, it's an\nincredibly original idea, and probably one that can never be replicated\nagain, and in the sea of reboots, remakes, and sequels that are thrown\nat us, this stands out, in all of its absurd, raunch- filled, excessive\nglory.

Take away all the vulgar humor, foul language, and\nobscenities altogether, and Sausage Party is ( not surprisingly) a very\ndumb movie. The first ten minutes of this had me, I mean, really had\nme...I laughed a few times, and thought I was in for a winner. After\nthe first ten minutes, it was already tiresome...the \"f\" bomb dropped\nmore times then I care to count. We get it, it's an R rated computer\nanimated movie, not intended for children. Does it really find the need\nto abuse the offensive material? In the case of Sausage Party, it does.\nIt just seems like an endless montage to say and do whatever possible\nto shock us, but after the first 20 minutes, you are actually immune to\nit, if you make it that far. The story actually makes you feel bad for\nconsuming food, something essential for life, and the idea that food\nhas real feelings and is alive is just pure silly, but for the films\npurposes, we play along, and therefore it turns out to be an\nentertaining piece to watch. If you don't think food that can talk and\nlike to cuss is funny, you're in a lot of trouble with this movie. Most\nof the jokes are misses, but the ones that are hits, they are worth\nremembering. So when food finds out it is being purchased to be eaten,\nthey decide to fight back. I thought the movie was quite violent, a\nhuman head is actually decapitated ( by accident) and after an hour of\nwatching this, there are finally several \"oh my god!\" moments...you may\nbe caught a little off guard by the turn it takes, and trust me, you\nwill know what I'm talking about...quite a bit of gore at the end. So\nall in all, this is a story about food vs people. Who will win? The\nquestion really is, who will care? And how many will laugh at it?\n"},

The problems is that, if we\nextract the vulgarity, the only thing we have is a horrible copy of Toy\nStory (Food has secret lives!) with an awful production design and poor\nanimation. One of the very few positive things I can say about this\npiece of junk is Kristen Wiig's voice work; despite her horrible\ndialogues and null characterization, she managed to bring some\npersonality to her character. In conclusion, I didn't hate Sausage\nParty because of its constant vulgarity. I hated it because I found it\nunfunny and irritating. If you want to watch good animated comedies\n\"for adults\", I recommend you Team America: World Police or South Park:\nBigger, Longer and Uncut.\n"},
{"review": "\nNot funny.<br><br>Those are the two words that I would sum up Sausage Party with. No\nmatter what your sense of humor is, there is no WAY that anybody could\nfind this stuff funny, and yet, it has an 83% on Rotten Tomatoes. <br><br>Wow.<br><br>I thought every would hop off the it's-funny-because-I'm-baked-Seth\nRogen-train after the profoundly stupid and unfunny The Interview. <br><br>But no, and were probably gonna get another one of these half-baked (ha\nha) \"smart\" stoner comedies.<br><br>So, right off the bat, Sausage Party is annoying, with a screechy,\nfaux-intelligent take on the extravagant musical numbers prevalent in\nmost other (better) animated movies.<br><br>The commentary on religion is so ham-fisted, unintelligent and\nREPETITIVE, that the movie begins to feel like a propaganda piece for\natheism. <br><br>Oh, yea and Seth, just a thought, swearing is fine and can sometimes\nwork to elevate the humor in other (better) comedies, but the joke\ncan't just be the swearing itself. You know that right?...Seth?<br><br>The only time I actually began to genuinely chuckle was the food-orgy\nscene, but still, it was a cheap-laughs scene. If what would be a minor\nsight gag in other (better) comedies is the highlight of your movie,\nthen your kind of screwed.<br><br>It's kind of sad actually, to see Seth Rogen sacrifice his talent on\ndumpster-fires like \"The Interview\" and now this. I thought his\nmeta-comedy \"This Is the End\" was pretty funny, and I thought 2009's\n\"Observe and Report\" was unusually dark, brutal and depressing in an\noriginal way (but then again, it's coming from the co-creater of\n\"Eastbound &amp; Down\"). <br><br>Final thoughts: It's awful and unbearable, unless, of course, your\nhate-watching it.

{"review": "\nWithin the first few minutes of the film, I cannot describe how bored\nto death I was of this film.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of all Seth Roger's\nmovies, but this is just garbage. I even read somewhere online that\nSeth Rogen is even considering making a Sausage Party 2. And if Seth is\nreading this, don't do it, man. This movie is going to bring your\ncareer downhill into a pile of mud and horse crap.

{"review": "\nWhen I first saw the trailer, I thought \"Finally! They're bringing back\nadult animation to the mainstream!

Before that, there's a whole\nlot of stuff that may put several people off.<br><br>The film uses too many f bombs, explicit jabs at political satire and\nold jokes that will probably make you groan rather than laugh. Though\nthis is a film clearly for adults, it feels juvenile. <br><br>There were, however quite a few laugh out loud moments, but not many.\nThe orgy scene at the end was hilarious, scathingly crude and insane.\nI've heard people complain about the racist and sexist jokes in the\nfilm, and yes, they are there, but the people who will be offended the\nmost are the religious ones.<br><br>It's anti-Pixar, anti religious, anti-PC, pro-stoner, pro-sex and more.\nBut unfortunately it doesn't really carry out a powerful enough message\nas the Bakshi films, Meet The Feebles or South Park. For a project of\nthis caliber, I think it could have left a few things out, and a bit\nmore satirical depth.\n"},
{"review": "\nWish I had read the reviews or something before I tried to watch this\nabomination of a movie. I usually like Seth Rogen but as a victim of\nsexual assault for years and having been trying to treat my Post\ntraumatic stress disorder for my entire child and adult life, this\nmovie was an insult, I don't understand how sexual assault is funny or\nhow people can reenact it for entertainment. I understand that it is\njust cartoons but that doesn't change the meaning of the action. I was\nexcited, at first, to watch Seth Rogan's new movie because he has had\nsome funny ones but this one was very cruel and seemed to glorify some\nless than reputable actions.

I'm sure the actors had\nfun in-studio and shared a ton of laughs while making this film, but it\nwas poorly reflected to the audience. I had a feeling that this movie\nwas going to be bad from the previews, but I had no idea it would be\nthis rough.

{"review": "\nI truly regret we wasted our time and money on this vulgar, pointless\nhour and a half of idiocy. If this had been cast with real humans, it\nwould have been rated X. Even though it was animated, the blatant\nsexual acts should have required a different rating than R. It is so\ndisappointing that movies like this don't come with a warning label\nthat those with any degree of intellect should refrain from viewing. It\nwas obviously strained to push an agenda. This review will never be\nable to describe what could have been a funny movie; it was nothing but\na series of expletiives and filthy innuendos. Are there Hollywood\nJackass Awards?

{"review": "\nThis movie is based on an interesting and imaginative idea. The story\nis not for adults. It is a simple children's story. Yet, you cannot\nshow this movie to children because there is too much profanity within\ntime spans of thirty seconds throughout the whole movie. I did not\nwatch until the end. It was a waste of time to feed myself with such\ndecadent garbage. I understand why America is quickly falling. This is\nthe kind of movie that people want to see. Sadly it reflects the\nsociety.

{"review": "\nHonestly this movie was so sick. I watched the trailer, I knew there\nwould be cussing and perversion-- but there was TOO much of it. I kid\nyou not, 99% of every sentence in this film had an overuse of cuss\nwords. The perversion was completely overdone and out of hand. It\nwasn't funny, just flat out disgusting. Save your money and don't watch\nit in theaters or on Netflix, just watch it online for free when it's\nout if you really want to see it... but I and there other 6 friends I\nwent to see it with highly recommend you don't. The stuff they promote\nis sick. So corrupt. The first few minutes of the film you're fine, but\nget a little startled at the amount of cussing you hear. People who\nnormally cuss don't even cuss that much, so it wasn't realistic. 20\nminutes in and you're in utter shock by what you see. As the movie\ncontinues to progress, you'll find yourself horrified and struck by\ndisbelief. It's awkward and so WRONG-- all of it! I mean you see rape\nhere! Murder! Threesomes! Drug abuse! And let's not even get started\nabout the blasphemy and complete disregard of faith in God. I walked\nout. I couldn't finish watching and nor did I want to. I deeply regret\nsupporting this film by paying for it. It's offensive and dehumanizing.\n"},

{"review": "\nI knew going into this movie that was an animated film specifically for\nadults. That being said I knew the language would be questionable. But\nthis movie was over the top with profanity. If the foul language was\nnot enough the humor was very offensive. I walked out of the theater\nfeeling as if every race and religion should be offended. I mean it\nliterally referenced the Holocaust in the first 40 seconds... The jokes\nwere the types of jokes middle school aged children make and they were\nreally not that funny. The last scene of the film was not needed as\nwell. In fact it was quite awkward for everyone in the theater. Nothing\nlike a group of adults watching an orgy of our favorite foods. All in\nall, I do not recommend this movie to any one.
