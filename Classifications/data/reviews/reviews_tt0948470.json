{"review": "\ni love this film. it does the character of spider-man justice. Andrew\nGarfield was chosen perfectly as peter parker. After spider-man 3 we\nneeded a change and this is a great fresh take on the character. It is\nmore comic accurate than the Raimi films such as the web shooters and\nGwen Stacy as the love interest instead of Mary Jane. I liked the new\nsuit because it looked like a teen could make it. The villain the\nlizard was a great first foe for spider man. Uncle Bens death scene\nmade me want to cry and Garfields reaction was sad. I love how Gwen\ncomforted him and Flash didn't bully him out of sorrow. i love how\npeter went from being a vigilante hunting his uncles killer to a hero\nfighting all crime.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst off, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and\nDennis are all Perfect in their roles. This movie is very different\nfrom the original, except for the origins which can obviously not be\nchanged. The action is what spidey fans have always dreamed off. The\nchemistry between peter and Gwen is priceless. New and interesting\nstory lines are created to be explored through out the trilogy/saga.\nThe new suit is great in my opinion, but it has been changed for the\nsequel, yet either way I like them both. Andrew Garfield's emotional\nscenes are unbelievable. Finally, I absolutely loved the humor. And the\nending left me satisfied and happy, yet excited for what is yet to\ncome. Overall, this is an origin that succeeds on many levels and out\ndoes the previous origin (which is still great) and only Spider-man 2\nis equal in its acting, style, humor, action, and theme.\n"},
{"review": "\nHaving realized I'm a sucker for all these comic book adaptations, of\ncourse I had to see this one as well. I never did like the earlier\nSpiderman movies, being the main role or the supporting ones, I'm not\nsure; but they still stand among the movies I'm not eager to watch\nagain. But this one, on the contrary, was actually quite entertaining.\nNot was it only packed with really great CGI, but it had a great flow\nbuilt up on both action, drama, romance and humor.<br><br>At least for me this is what makes a good movie. I never once thought\n\"Oh, my goodness that was lame\" (which I often actually do), instead I\nwas rather surprised I was laughing out loud in more than one of the\nscenes.<br><br>All the actors did a MARVELous job, meaning all the jokes, the depth of\nthe drama, and the sincerity of both the romance and the action stood\nsolid throughout the movie. Speaking of the actors: the casting was\nbrilliant. All of the main actors (and I guess most of the supporting\nones) was perfect for their roles, and must have made the script it\nself proud.\n"},
{"review": "\nAlrighty this movie was awesome! Yeah it could of used a little here\nand there, but the fact of the matter is that it is SPIDER-MAN. I am a\ncomic fan, and after watching this I could agree that they captured the\ntrue spider-man, not some Toby creation<br><br>The moment i realized that he was building his own web slinger i knew\nthat this was going to be good! I loved how Spider-man made funny\njokes, he didn't shoot his fingers as guns and people walking by, he\nactually was funny, nerdy, and AWESOME!!! Gwen Stacey is great! Dr.\nConnors is amazing, when he transforms its gnarly, it gives you the\nfeel of how he is being taken over.<br><br>There are some plot errors, like how does he get the web slinger stuff,\nand what happens to the semi transformed cops, while they are\ntransformed. but other than that it flows pretty nicely.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Amazing Spider-Man came out in 2012, but I only saw it about a year\nafter it's release, but before Amazing Spider-Man 2 came out in\ntheaters. I enjoyed Andrew Garfield allot more than Tobey Maguire's\nperformance as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Andrew had the wise\ncrack of Spider-Man because if you read the comics or watch any of the\ncartoons, you'll see Spider-Man as a wise cracker and as Peter Parker,\nhe has nerdy, but he is more than just a nerd. He was also a teenager\nwho had friends. Emma Stone was a much better romantic lead than\nKristen Dunst. And I thought the action was much better than the first\nSpider-Man. Overall, I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 9 out of 10, a\nfantastic movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI enjoyed this movie because it was a superhero film with many funny\nbits. I like to be able to laugh while watching a movie, not just watch\nloads of CGI action. I also liked the fact that the villain wasn't\nkilled just defeated and put in prison, giving him a second chance.\nHowever, I do believe that was partially do to the fact that the\nproducers/writers wanted something to write a future film on. I think\nthat Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did exceptionally in their roles.\nGarfield really seemed to actually be Peter Parker and I love to see\nthat in a film. Although this movie is a superhero movie I do believe\nit was geared toward a younger audience, unlike the Dark Knight. The\nfact that Spider-man is a teenager in this one and that it is not\nnearly as dark as some other films certainly convinced me of this. I\nrecommend this to anyone who enjoys action and superheroes. Side note:\nDenis Leary was great!\n"},
{"review": "\nMan that's an excellent movie. The acting is so much better than the\noriginal Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire. The new Peter Parker is\n10 x's a better actor than Tobey Maguire. I enjoyed the Avengers movie\nbut the Amazing Spiderman's plot works much better to me and the\nstory-line just seems to pulls you along effortlessly and keeps you\nintrigued and interested at the same time. It's the great blend of\nstory/plot, good acting, and action-adventure and fight scenes with the\nbad guy. As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the better\nones. I think it's most definitely better than the last two Spiderman\nmovies and probably better than the first one but not by too much.<br><br>It is worth the price of admission to watch this movie and it would be\na great movie to take your kids since their isn't anything crazy\nhappening in this movie.\n"},

My 9 year old also came out thinking this is the best spider-man\nfilm yet, trumping the Sam Raimi ones, which while excellent didn't\nhave the same amount of 'soul' for me. <br><br>My best friend and his wife didn't want to watch this due to the\nnegativity surrounding it, which is a real shame as I think they have\nmissed out on a real gem. <br><br>A 9 from me, the average of mine and my son's rating. :)<br><br>P.S.

The only part I\nwas disappointed with was the fact that peter parkers school bully\nbecame his friend at the end, because I was glad to see how they made\npeters bully was sorry for beating him up when it came to a life and\ndeath matter but when he became his friend it was taken to far and felt\nto corny. other than that it was defiantly worth seeing.\n"},

{"review": "\nMany years ago, Stan Lee crafted a story with, perhaps the worlds most\nbeloved superhero. Spiderman is the story of Peter Parkers life.

Shallowness We\nnever really get inside the character's heads and most of the dramatic\nscenes (with Uncle Ben giving advice, dying etc.) are shallow and\nuninvolved - merely doing lip-service to the events (\"oh, yeah, and\nthis happened as well and we should make a scene out of it\").<br><br>2. Villain The villain was a shallow shell and ultimately very\nuninteresting.<br><br>3. Aunt May She seemed to have something to do up until Uncle Ben died,\nbut then she really did not do anything else but stand around. We\ndidn't even see her grieve properly. So, shallow again.<br><br>4. Bad love story The movie was long, but still failed to tell us how\nPeter fell in love with Gwen. Certainly he stuttered around her a lot,\nbut they never seemed to actually talk about anything or make a real\nconnection.\n"},

I really hate remakes and\nextensions of movies unless they stay close to the original and carry\noff the heart of the original movie, like Pirates of the Caribbean,\nlike Spiderman 2 and 3 with Toby. They did not feel like a new movie,\nthey were an extension of the one we loved. Some movies are just done\nto death and the changes in actors just seems to sour things for you.

{"review": "\nI saw the Tobey Maguire trilogy, and I liked it, those movies were\nsignificant in my childhood, then I began to read the comic-books and I\nliked Spider-man even more, it was my obsession, and I realized that\nthe movies were so different than the original story.<br><br>Now, this brand-new movie comes out and I feel good with the result,\neverything is better! The cast, of course, is more accurate to the idea\nof the original Spidey, while in the other movies Sam Raimi used mature\nactors, a big mistake, Peter is a teenager! Point to TASM. The story in\nthis movie was not perfect, but I liked it. Acting was great! All of\nthe actors got into their characters so well. Visual effects were\nawesome, beautiful, well-done. And finally something that cannot miss\nin any spider-man story, the humor, in The Amazing Spider-man the humor\ngoes by funny and smart quotes and situations, while in the previous\nmovies the humor was a little bit ridiculous.<br><br>Finally all I can say is, now I'm older, and after watching the four\nmovies, my thumb-up goes to this one, a true success.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have to say, I actually thought this was very good. Some people liked\nit some people didn't. It definitely can't beat the Spider Man 1 and 2\nwith Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco, however; I thought\nthat it portrayed the background of Spiderman really well. I have also\nheard that this one follows the comic more. One thing I really liked\nwas the background info given on Peter's parents. I also liked how he\nhas the web developer in this one rather than pressing on the palm of\nhand or whatever Tobey Maguire did in the first one. I also found the\nvillain interesting-the lizard. I thought the scenes where Dr. Connors\nturned into the lizard were cool, however; I DO NOT Recommend SEEING IT\nIN 3D; I SAW IT IN 3D, I APPRECIATED The STORY AND ACTING BUT NOT\nNECESSARILY THE 3D VISUALS. Andrew Garfield did an amazing job as\nSpiderman. He embodied the role so well; Emma Stone did a great job as\nwell. There was good humor in it too but not as good as the original. I\nthought it was funny when he broke the alarm clock. I also liked the\nscene with the basketball.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was excellent and it amazes me that I continue to see\nnegative reviews, so much so I was spurred to write on myself. I really\ncannot see any element in which this movie does not surpass the\noriginal. The actors- I believed that Garfield gave a role that\nawesomely fits spidey from the comics, he delivered wit smoothly while\nalso embracing Peter Parker's nerdy persona. Emma stone likewise filled\nher role quite well and her acting abilities surpass Kirsten Dunst.\nFurthermore, the action and special effects. Anyone reviewing that says\nthis element of the film is subpar is just being biased and lying to\nthemselves. The fight scenes were incredible and there was so much\nsuspense I was on the edge of my seat sweating. The special fx was\ndelivered so flawlessly everything looked unbelievably realistic and\nnot only that spider man's animations were awesome, pure awesome. I had\nhigh expectations and was not let down, don't let these negative\nreviews scare you away!\n"},
{"review": "\nAs a child, Peter Parker's parents abruptly abandoned him, leaving him\nin the care of his right-minded aunt and uncle.

Reboot/remake of the series\nthat began with Sam Raimi's 2002 original can't avoid some\nfamiliarities, and is let down by a long running time and some thinly\ndeveloped characters, but it's made worthwhile by good casting, nifty\nspecial effects, and intense, edge of your seat action scenes.

When you watch\nthis, you can''t help but to compare it with the other series. The new\nPeter Parker was played very well, but for some reason, you just can't\nsee him as Spider-man. Granted, this movie had a nice storyline, good\nvisual effects, and even a different idea of how he learned to control\nhis power. Directing was good, but like I said, they tried to get us\nattached to this movie like the original one did, but it just didn't\ncatch on.

{"review": "\nFirstly, I will say a massive well done to the casting director.\nSeriously, every actor was so well selected to their respective roles.\nMartin Sheen, Sally Field, Rhys Ifans, Emma Stone and by no means least\nAndrew Garfield. In fact the most negative thing I will say about this\nmovie is that I will find it hard to watch the other Spider Man movies\nthe same way now!! The movie plays out well and is not in too much of\nhurry to get to the main storyline. The effects are not too much that\nyou are thinking CGI Oh my god!! Andrew Garfield plays Spider Man so\nwell that he has truly made it his own. Watch it and you won't be\ndisappointed.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe newest adaptation of the Spider-Man story, although a bit early, is\narguably the best one yet. The guys in my office at DISH think that was\ndue to the fact that the script stays a lot closer to the original\nSpider-Man comics plot, but I think it was because we were giving more\ninformation about the disappearance of Peter's parents. Also the\nwriters made a bold move to have Peter spend more time in high school\nand I am positive that that is going to pay off in the long run. I\nnever have time to stop at the Redbox down the street to grab movies,\nbut since I started renting from Blockbuster at Home through DISH the\ndiscs are already waiting in my mailbox when I get off work and this\nwas an awesome first choice.\n"},
{"review": "\nI never really understood why they were doing a remake of spider-man. I\nwas hoping for something stronger in concept, perhaps better acting,\nbut i was sorely disappointed. I didn't understand why Gwen (who is a\nhigh school student) is an intern in some acclaimed lab. I didn't\nunderstand how peter came up with that webbing, or how people of the\ncity liked spider-man enough to help him out in the end. It made no\nsense! However, the room with the spiders spinning was pretty cool and\nhow peter got bitten was pretty cool, but that was about it! The comic\nrelief between uncle Ben and aunt may held nothing more than that,\ncomic relief. The death of uncle Ben in the previous movie was far more\npoignant than in this movie, but it does make for a logical explanation\nfor how spider-man came into being. The back story with how peter's\nparents went missing seemed merely an excuse to make another spider-man\nmovie. It didn't seem all that fleshed out, and peter just happens to\nstumble into all of that mess and mystery, is just flabbergasting. So\nwhy was this movie made again?\n"},

So you\nwant find anything much new here,even the CG isn't good enough.

{"review": "\nThe other movies are OK. They stick to the original storyline and the\nacting was fine - it involved quite a few of my favourite actors.

Therefore I got bored to the\npoint that I didn't even bother watching the third film. I am pleased\nto report that for me this is the Spiderman from the comics come to\nlife on the big screen. Andrew Garfield plays the geeky, hopeless,\nclumsy hero who even though he has amazing powers, is still a nerd at\nheart. I did prefer Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin but I do love Rhys\nIfans who does a great job. The storyline he is attached to is modern\nand relevant. Martin Sheen is always a pleasure to watch and I shed\nreal tears when he inevitably dies. I had been put off by the last\nmovies but this was much better than I expected. The only thing that\nputs me off is that Garfield looks so much like tennis player Andy\nMurray it's weird to see him smile...\n"},

Also his\nweb slingers are introduced because in the comics spidey couldn't\ncreate webbing the movie shows peters struggles and build up to become\na better person and a great hero just like in the comics. He is also\ncomical and arrogant just like the comics so why hate just because its\ntrue to the comic doesn't make it bad the acting is great and Garfield\nplayed a better spider-man than Toby.
