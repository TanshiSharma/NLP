{"review": "\nATTENTION: THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE MOVIE. THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE\nREVIEWS.<br><br>As I usually do before I watch new movies, I came to IMDb to read some\nreviews. First, I read the 5 top \"Love it\" and then the 5 top \"hate\nit\". The comments were so diametrically different that I decided to\ninvestigate who was posting these comments.<br><br>Surprisingly, the top \"love it\" reviewers were all new IMDb members.\nWhat's more, none of them have any other review. Even more strange, all\nthe reviews seemed manufactured with hype-type sentences. Here are some\nexamples extracted from these reviews:<br><br>- \"it's damned entertaining, and visually appealing. I recommend it in\n3D if you can watch it that way\" - \"Everything I could have wanted, and\nmore.\" - \"Oh my gosh, did my excitement grow\" - \"It blew me away.\" - \"I\ndecided to go see the movie, ready for it to suck. I was astonished to\nfind myself laughing throughout the movie\" - \"This movie is AMAZING!\"<br><br>By contracts, the top 5 haters, all of them, have been long-standing\nmembers with at the very least a dozen reviewed titles. In fact, take a\nlook at my own profile and you will find that I have been reviewing\nmovies here for years.<br><br>I am not saying that the positive reviews are fake. I am not accusing\nanyone. But if I were you I would do due diligence before trusting a\nsuspicious review.<br><br>I am NOT going to see this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI went into this movie with an open mind hoping that it would not be as\nbad as the trailers and TV spots suggest. It is. I really wanted this\nmovie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for the\ncharacters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to\nachieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An\nunfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on a beloved\nclassic which has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances\nI've seen in a while. The computer generated effects were like\nsomething out of a live action Disney picture. The music, in particular\nthe theme tune was uninspiring and added no impact or energy to the\nmovie. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film\nhas. After waiting so long for a new Ghostbusters film this comes as a\nmajor disappointment. Some things are just best left alone.\n"},
{"review": "\nI've never seen the original Ghostbusters films, so I went into\nwatching this with quite an open mind. It ended up being incredibly\ndisappointing though, the CGI was terrible and reminded me of the early\n2000s live action Scooby Doo films, the girls, who I'd imagine are\nfunny in their own right, seemed to have absolutely zero chemistry\nbetween them and oddly enough Chris Hemsworth's character Kevin ended\nup being the most funny aspect of the film. <br><br>That's just my personal opinion however. My boyfriend who I went to see\nthe film with whispered to me 'this is awful,' half way through and he\nrevealed to me that he had felt ashamed while watching the film. I went\nbecause he guaranteed me it was going to be enjoyable and I think it\ndidn't take long until he realised that the movie was a disappointment.\n"},
{"review": "\nSome people are saying that this is the wort movie of all time. It is\nnot. It is merely a really bad movie with no redeeming qualities, and\nit insults your intelligence.<br><br>And, most of the YouTube videos made slamming it are 100s of times\nfunnier than this movie.<br><br>Seriously, the movie is just not funny. In fact Batman and Robin\n(George Clooney and whoever played Robin) had more humor in it than\nthis movie does, and that movie was worse than this one--that is how\nnot funny this movie is. <br><br>Save your money. Read a cereal box. It will cost less and be funnier.\n"},
{"review": "\nHonestly, I didn't care about the gender swap that much so long as the\nfilm would be a good watch. But it wasn't. it was a terrible, unfunny\nwaste of my time and every other poor soul who had the painful\nmisfortune of having to sit and bear witness to this god awful, inane,\ninept and pathetic excuse for entertainment. Not a single moment did\nthis wretched movie give me the tiniest iota of anything that would\nresemble pleasure. Not a single joke made me laugh, not for any second\ncould this film make me muster up a single emotion other than pure\nanger and disgust, I didn't care about any of the main characters and\nwas so detached from them that if all 4 characters died horribly in the\nfilm I would have less of an emotion than I do when I flush my\nexcrement down the toilet. Further-more just to give you an idea of how\ncomprehensively bored i was, I found myself looking at my watch at a\npoint in the film hoping it would be nearing it's end only to find that\nthe film was only 30 minutes into it's running time. I abhor, despise,\nloathe and resent this movie and plea to anyone reading this to avoid\nthis movie like the plague that it is. In fact I retract that statement\nas frankly comparing this film to the plague would be an insult to the\nplague as it has far more reason to exist than this film does.\n"},

{"review": "\nI went into the movie prepared to not like it because I had heard some\nbad reviews (these reviews didn't actually have anything to say about\nthe movie but that it was bad). I've got to say that I smiled\nthroughout the entire movie and I don't think there was a person in the\ntheater who wasn't thoroughly enjoying themselves. I saw the movie with\n4 other people and we all loved it so much. It's the only movie within\nmy memory that I've wanted to see in theaters more than once.<br><br>I really appreciated that the female characters were strong and smart\nand even though they'd had disagreements they weren't petty about them.\nThey acted like real people. And they were funny without being really\noffensive, which some people find hard for some reason? <br><br>I think this movie has good role models for young girls and boys; there\nare 3 women scientists and a history nerd who aren't \"sexed up\" for the\nmale gaze. They are belittled and ridiculed for their beliefs but they\novercome that to do the right thing, not to prove themselves to anyone.\nAnd they're really cool while doing it, too.<br><br>The special effects feels real but not too real in a good way. I guess\nto say that they're not painful to watch (as an animation student I get\nvery upset over bad effects) but there is a cheesiness to them that is\nendearing. <br><br>I think this movie is something that anyone can enjoy as long as they\ndon't mind women being treated like human beings instead of sexy prizes\n(which is a joke that they play off of using a Hot Dumb Male character,\nbut in the end he's treated like a person and is no one's \"prize\").\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you (like me) consider Bill Murray humor more cynical than funny\nthen stop reading and go to see this very well done re-make that really\nimproves a lot on the original. <br><br>If you are not still convinced; let me tell you why. The original\nGHOSTBUSTERS was about 3 misfit nerds, an African American guy and a\ngirl (the love interest). Only the girl and one of guys has a lot to do\nin the movie; the rest of characters were heavily underwritten\n(specially the black guy).<br><br>In this remake; there are three nerds (women), an African American\n(woman) and a love interest (guy, cute but not smart at all). But this\ntime, screen time is shared, everybody has a few fun time (even the\nstupid guy) and the African American girl is lots more better written\nthan the blonde one.<br><br>This is obvious a McCarthy and Wiig movie; however Paul Feig (the\ndirector) let the others two shine and the chemistry between the four\nwomen works even better than the original.<br><br>In terms of jokes; there is lot of slapstick; some women/men sexual\njokes and even sum digital FX jokes that make the kids laugh. All that\nis far more than you can tell about the original that if you see it\nagain now; you will find it kind of boring and not that entertaining\nthan this one (I just did before seen this one).<br><br>Forget the classic; contrary to even my expectations; this one came out\nquite right\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this movie the day it came out, and I, my boyfriend, and all\nhundred or so people in the movie theater laughed our asses off for the\nwhole movie, credit bonuses and all. Kate McKinnon is a treasure, and\nthe entire cast was phenomenal. There wasn't a single dud joke in the\nentire film. This movie is a wickedly good time, and I fully intend to\nsee it again in theaters. <br><br>To the men (and it is almost entirely men) who have been complaining\nabout this movie for one reason or another for months before its\nrelease, I'd just like to say: the franchise isn't ruined. Women can be\ncomedy action stars, and be them insanely well. Don't believe me? WATCH\nTHE DAMN MOVIE. And seriously, if you think one movie with an\nall-female primary cast is a death knell for the genre, you should know\nthat for us women, this is the most refreshing change of scenery we've\nhad in decades, with 85% of top-grossing movies featuring male\nprotagonists. So go ahead: buy an absurdly large pickup truck. Carry\nboulders up a mountain. Drink 30 beers at once, whatever it takes to\npiece back together your fragile masculinity, because guess what? This\nis a thing now. Women make up 51% of the world's population and 52% of\nthe movie-going audience. We contributed a full 50% of the total box\noffice revenue in 2014. And we like stuff other than rom-coms (no\ndisrespect to rom-coms).<br><br>Deal with it.\n"},
{"review": "\nI never found the original 1984 Ghostbusters all that funny --\nespecially Bill Murray's quirky shtick. I went to the sequel out of\ncuriosity to see what happens when the roles are swapped. Would the\nwhole thing just be a gimmick?<br><br>I was delighted to find nonstop laughter from a far more energetic and\nfast-paced sequel from the original --propelled by a clever script and\ngreat comedy acting. It's hard to go wrong when you have the wacky\nantics of Melissa McCarthy in the mix. And, SNL's Kate McKinnon plays a\nwonderfully amusing geeky and slightly maniacal scientist that just\nkeep you giggling. Also, nice to see the Thor hulk, Chris Emsworth,\nplay a Monty Python-like silly character in his role as office\nsecretary. The flirtatious play between him and the ladies is lots of\nfun.<br><br>I was also glad to seen the film pay homage to the storyline and style\nof the first film. However, having the predictably gratuitous cameos by\nsome of the original cast didn't add to the laugh momentum at all. <br><br>Despite the negative reviews I certainly would not consider anything in\nthe film tokenism or sexist. Are people so thin-skinned about what they\nperceive these days as \"politically correct?\" This film would not have\nbeen nearly as engaging with an all-male cast. It would have been just\nanother boring sequel that would have invited endless comparisons to\nthe original actors.<br><br>About halfway through the film the tight-paced hilarity throttles back\nfor the predictable huge battle with an army of ghosts. These\ninevitable climatic special effects orgasms get tiring. <br><br>This is by far one of the most entertaining and funniest films I've\nseen in a very long time. I'm delighted that they seem to have left the\ndoor open for a sequel.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe chemistry between this four really funny women is the coolest thing\nthe movie has to offer, just like the original did with its cast. The\nladies play to their comedic strengths with characters that sort of\nreflect their personalities and there are several laugh out loud\nmoments. The plot was okay, not worse but also not better when compared\nto the original. The exaggerated visual effects that are very\ncharacteristic to the franchise were well placed, just like the\nappearances of original cast members. It's not the best movie of the\nyear, but then again neither were the originals when they were\nreleased. Even though some people say they don't see the point of this\nmovie being remade, specially with women, I really hope the trend of\nremaking the classics with a female cast continues because little girls\ndeserve to have characters they can look up to that is a reflection of\nthemselves, just like little boys have been for so long. And for the\nlove of god stop whining and trying to find reasons not to like it.\nJust embrace the awesomeness that are funny women.\n"},
{"review": "\nTo keep things short and sweet: the movie was entertaining, funny, and\na good way to spend a night out. It's not the worst thing to hit\ntheaters in years, despite what the reviewers on here seem to think.\nAnd of course it's not the best thing, either. But was the first\nGhostbusters some sort of cinematic masterpiece that no comedy film\nwill ever live up to? No. It was an entertaining comedy film- nothing\nmore, nothing less. Just like this one. If the sequel didn't ruin\nthings for you, the remake won't either. I promise. I know people are\nupset that the movie has been recast and redone for 2016, and I feel a\nlot of that has to do with the fact that it's an all woman recast\n(because let's be real). But all the original (living) cast members\nshowed up to make cameos, which I'm sure they wouldn't have bothered\nwith if they didn't think the movie would be good.

{"review": "\nGB84 and GB89 were my first favorite movies, and I could quote them\nextensively before I turned 10 years old. I am in the prime demographic\nto feel \"betrayed\" by a reboot, but I adored this movie. Paul Feig and\nKatie Dippold have written for two of the shows closest to my heart\n(Freaks &amp; Geeks, Parks &amp; Recreation), so it makes sense that they would\nace this seemingly impossible challenge: Make a film that both honors\nand respects the original, but is also fun and original in its own\nright. The homages - cameos, quotes, similar scenes - are an absolute\njoy for their nostalgia AND imaginative reinvention; this is a film\nthat only a die-hard fan could make. Like its source, it expertly\nblends silly, scary, and the genuine triumph of four friends bringing\nout the best in each other to save the best city on earth. The leads\nare terrific, they have their own wonderfully weird humor and rhythm,\nwith only superficial similarities to the characters who came before.\nThis film clearly exists not to replace the original, but to celebrate\nit and bring something new to the universe. Well-freakin-done, you\nguys! I have the 80's cartoon action figures, the film figures that\n(finally) came out in the 2000's, and I will proudly display Abby,\nErin, Jillian, and Patty beside them!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film doesn't take itself too seriously or follow the original in\nany serious way, but is instead a beautifully funny homage to the\noriginal that is done SO well.

It's not even a remake, it's more of an addition to the\nseries and it's so humorous. The effects are awesome and colourful like\njoy in a can and the changes are crazy. The only other reasons I can\nsee for not liking this movie is an expectation of seeing the original\nredone in the exact same way with new effects.<br><br>That or some people can't stand to see the jarring difference of women\nactually playing great roles for a change.

But those moments\nwere rare and very soon put back on track.<br><br>One other thought is that I don't like most remakes of late, so if you\ndo like remakes maybe this is the wrong kind of remake for you. Rather\nthan making everything darker and more serious as most become, it does\nthe complete opposite. Don't see it as a remake or reboot, but a lot of\nfun.

{"review": "\nAfter hearing nothing but that the movie had bad reviews, I decided to\nlook up these reviews I was hearing so much about.

Not only were each of the leads\nwell thought out and well rounded, they were all genuinely delightful.\nThis may not be the best comedy of all time, but it is certainly the\nbest movie I've seen in recent years.

So, open your mind and heart\nand go see it if you are so inclined, and take a kid who is interested\nin STEM, too. Kate McKinnon is the standout as the group's \"M\" who\ninvents their equipment and handles the ridiculous science babble with\nease. Leslie Jones takes a character that could have been a stereotype\nand makes her a funny type with layers. Liam Hemsworth has a lot to do\nas the dim-bulb receptionist, and he handles physical comedy really,\nreally well along side four women who have made their careers doing so.\nSome of the humor is deeply, deeply weird - including an extended\nhomage to Patrick Swayze's career - and I appreciate a movie this big\nwilling to go that strange.\n"},

By all Leslie Jones expresses a perfect balance of smart, funny,\nand streetwise. Kristen Wiig plays against type like a genius. I know\nthis is not the funniest film ever made, however in my opinion it is\nclose. When a film makes me, belly laugh I am in love for life! There\nis a treat hiding around every corner.

Don't hate on the film\nbefore you have seen it because you don't like the cast. Yes it is\ndifferent from the original, it's thirty-two years on.

I was completely blown away\nand have a new respect for Paul Feig. Despite the hoards of whining\ntrolls trying to rain on its parade, we got a movie that balances the\ntone of the original with the comedy of a new decade, all without\nalienating a new audience. I'm looking forward to a new era of female\nled action. I for one, am pumped for the sequel. 10/10.\n"},

The new Ghostbusters contains absolutely fantastic cameos - I\nwon't spoil it for you, but if you really love the original\nGhostbusters, you will love it too. <br><br>I also enjoyed how they turned around the story of the Ghostbusters\nlogo origins, the firefighters station, etc. <br><br>I'm not sure whether this movie can be considered a remake or a parody,\nbecause it's a perfect mix of the both. <br><br>H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S!

It works\nincredibly well. The special effects are really good. The ghosts look a\nlot more realistic, and all the scenes with the ghosts are incredibly\nthrilling and really keep you on end with the excitement of it all. I\nthought Kevin was an incredibly funny character, because he's just that\nbumbling idiot that kinda helps the ghostbusters, and the villain was a\ngreat character too. I loved his plans, and it really gets you\nthinking, how could these plans work? But they seem to work for him.\nAnd those end credits, they were so random, but incredibly funny. So\noverall.

The antagonist was so\nflat and boring. Sorry, not buying this. 2. You know, I appreciated\nKevin and his endearingly dumb escapades. And the revengeful part of me\nenjoyed seeing the roles reversed.

My knowledge of ghostbusters was\nseeing it replayed on cable, the cartoon, and Ecto-Cooler juice boxes.\nI'm not a die-hard fan but I've always loved the movie.<br><br>That being said, I went into this movie with an open mind. I've heard\nnothing but \"It's hilarious\" and \"It's the perfect nod to the movies\"\nfrom friends - and I was not disappointed. <br><br>The chemistry between the four leads - and Chris Hemsworth - is\nfantastic. Their comedic styles are all different but it WORKS. We were\nloudly laughing with the whole theater to the point that our stomachs\nhurt. And on the flip side, the research and conviction towards the\nparanormal and science was what you hope for with the franchise. <br><br>We laughed, gasped and clapped for every cameo. It doesn't try to be\nthe originals - it doesn't need to. New universe - new story. But the\nnods to the originals - and NY - were perfect.<br><br>I will be seeing this multiple times. Thank you to the cast and crew\nfor doing right by this franchise. I can't wait to see a sequel.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is the most refreshingly original, yet\nlovingly-referential-to-its-predecessor reboot of a cult classic that\nI've ever seen. It has enough verve and fresh humor to stand on its own\nmerit, yet just enough original-cast cameos and satisfyingly clever\nnods to the 1984 version to ensure that it's on point.<br><br>If the almost complete lack of male gaze in this film is what's gotten\nalmost every previous reviewer's panties in a twist, then I'm laughing\nall the way to the end of this write-up. They've all proved just how\nsuccessfully this film has achieved its aims. When your four female\nprotagonists are, in no particular order, a queer neuroatypical\nscientist-slash-engineer, a confidently nerdy local-history buff of\ncolor, and a pair of academics who, in addition to having faced bullies\ntogether in their teenage years, also continue to face workplace\nbullying for both gender and research-interest reasons, the bottom line\nis that it's stellar representation. When you add to this the fact that\ntheir character development and interactions with each other are not\nonly cleverly and sensitively written, but also downright hilarious, I\nabsolutely fail to see how this film could be counted as a failure.<br><br>There's been a real dearth of truly fun, worthwhile, and socially\nrelevant summer blockbusters in recent years. This remake is a breath\nof fresh air and (as the majority of the user reviews on this page\namply demonstrate) a rollicking, status-quo-challenging kick in the\npants for those who indisputably need it.\n"},
{"review": "\nWow I've never seen so much hatred about a movie. A movie about\ncatching ghosts. Don't believe the other reviewers.<br><br>I do have to say that I'm a huge Paul Feig fan. I love his humor. And\nbefore people are going to batch the fact that Melissa McCarthy will be\nthe same character in every movie. In this movie she's not (I won't\nspoiler but I can say there will be no jokes about her weight, since in\nother movies she's played in, they like to joke about). It's a funny\nmovie with great visuals. A movie with a lot of links to the old\nGhostbusters.<br><br>If you want to see a funny movie, this one is. Don't read the negative\nreviews (I don't want to make mine to long, since I don't want to give\nspoilers). And don't base your opinion of the movie because of the low\nscore (today July 18th it's a 5,1). People have been scoring the movie\na 1 before it actually came out.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is funny as hell, and the four main actors really made this\nfilm their own with hilarious quirky characters. Yes it is like the\noriginal, that's the nature of a re-make. But the characters are not\nclones of the originals, if you are expecting a line for line re-make\nthat's not this. Of course there is a similar story line (again:\nremake!) Brilliant cameos from the original GB stars, including a sweet\nnod to Harold Ramis near the beginning. (Stay for the credits to see\none more!) The special effects are well done, and it's scary but not\ntoo scary for the older kids. The one thing I would have liked to see\nis for Leslie Jones' character to also be a scientist. Of course many\nof the (male) reviewers hated the tables being turned, with Chris\nHemsworth playing a gorgeous but grievously dumb secretary. Down with\nHollywood misogyny! Go see it.\n"},
{"review": "\nA hysterical, well plotted movie that pays tribute to the originals. It\nveers enough away from the 80s to hold its own. An awesome female cast\ndepicting smart, funny women. Some say this movie is \"man hating\" but\nall it does is reverse gender roles. How many movies out there are full\nof men with one woman (who happens to be a secretary?) Girl power and a\ndelight, and who couldn't love Chris's character!!!! Honestly any fan\nof the original who keeps an open mind (and open to the concept of a\nfemale cast) will love this movie. I say it's a total hit, and any girl\ncould agree. Whatever, trump. The ladies from Satetday Night live are\nfantastic, and Mcarthy and Wiig do it again. The characters are well\nrounded and impossible not to love. The plot is fast and full of humor.\nAs a girl who grew up watching Ghostbusters, I've fallen in love all\nover again!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nLoved it! A great reboot of a franchise and most decidedly NOT a\nremake. The original spirit (ha, spirit) of the 80s films was there\nalong with several tasteful nods/cameos. I laughed a LOT. The\nperformances were nuanced and each character had their own meter and\ntiming. The four leads are not rehashes of the four originals. For\nexample, the engineer's similarities to Egon began and ended at her\nglasses. She is not \"the Egon character.\" There are no direct\nsubstitutes for Venkmann, Ray, or Winston, either. Some folks have made\nsome racist assumptions that because Patty is black, she is the\n\"Winston.\" True, she started the film as the non-scientist, but she is\nalso well-read, believes in the mission of the team, and has a near\nencyclopedic knowledge of New York--a far cry from the original Winston\nwho would believe in anything if there was a paycheck in it for him.<br><br>This isn't ruining anyone's childhood anymore than 15 different Batman\nre-starts have. Forget what you've heard--mostly from people who are\ngiving it a bad review based on what they think it is and without\nhaving seen it, i.e. a giant chunk of the IMDb negative reviews--and\ngive it a chance on its own merits. This is a movie that stands on its\nown.\n"},
{"review": "\nIthought the movie was excellent. It was funny, engaging and I was\ngenuinely interested in the movie. I had seen the original and thought\nthat was hilarious so I was a bit apprehensive about this one living up\nto it. But I was pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between the four\nwas wonderful and was overall a great movie.<br><br>So looking at the score it has on IMDb has me scratching my head. Why\nis it so low on here? Why do all the professional reviewers agree with\nme about how good the movie is but these reviews don't? <br><br>I read through the reviews here and it's funny how all the low ratings\nare from men. Do you guys have that much of an issue with women playing\na role that was originally male? The sad thing is I know for certain if\nthis was a remake with all males, it wouldn't have been rated so low.\n"},
{"review": "\nI just saw this movies today and I absolutely LOVED it! I'm a fan of\nthe originals and this one honestly had the same vibe. The characters\nwere likable and smart. It was honestly so refreshing to see female\nleads that had some serious brain power. Holtzmann is an instant\nfavorite! I've seen a lot of guys on here whining about how the movie\n\"hates on men\". No, it doesn't. The men making these statements are the\nsame ones who came on here to rate it before the movie even came out.\nAll this film did, was reverse the roles. The women were the leads and\nthe powerful ones while 2 men (TWO, out of the whole film) were given\nroles that are 99.999% of the time given to women. If you want a movie\nwith a good story that makes you feel nostalgic all over, YOU NEED TO\nSEE THIS! 3/4 of the Original Ghostbusters say it's amazing, and I\ncompletely agree. :)\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat's to say? At this point the movie is so mired in controversy that\nany opinion on it seems like a political statement more than a movie\nreview. But here we go anyway - I didn't like it. It feels less like a\nmovie with an idea (in this case a recycled one) and more like one of\nthe many subpar comedies we have today where a few comedians who are\nfriends in real life get together and give us two hours of smug\nback-patting. It offers nothing memorable of its own, just a few\nreworked things from the original movie, which was a classic with many\niconic images and scenes. The only thing anyone will remember about\nthis is the controversy surrounding it. I don't care much for Melissa\nMcCarthy or Leslie Jones but I do like Kristen Wiig and I'm trying very\nhard to like Kate McKinnon (perhaps too hard). None of these women are\nimpressive here. Chris Hemsworth's character is used too much. It's an\nobvious joke that doesn't get funnier the more you tell it. Ultimately\nthe problem with this movie isn't that \"women aren't funny,\" so much as\ncomedy writers today are very lazy and uninspired.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was pleasantly surprised with this Ghostbusters version. I've seen\nthe original a few times and I always wondered what the hype was due to\nit being boring and drab. This modern new version was a wonderful\nsurprise and so much better! I never would have thought this to be the\ncase due to the low reviews it received. I think that movie reviewers\nare putting the old Ghostbusters on a pedestal where it doesn't belong.\nIt really wasn't that good. The only good thing about the old one was\nthe theme song and the all-star cast. This new one also has an all-star\ncast, and quite frankly, it is a refreshing movie of it's time. It's\nabout time we see a group of women together as protagonists doing\nsomething important without the sole purpose to look sexy. I can't\nthink of any other movie that fits that qualification, sadly. As a\nwoman, this movie warmed my soul. The characters are engaging and very\nsilly. I laughed numerous times throughout.\n"},

{"review": "\nThere has been so much unneeded hate around this movie.

It has some good stuff in it.\nLike for instance I really liked Leslie Jones as Patty and Kristen Wiig\nas well. But then there was Melissa McCarthy whose character I really\ndid not like and was really two dimensional and boring as well. I think\nthe choice to make this a straight comedy was a really bad decision. A\nlot of the jokes fall flat on there face and they hurt really badly. <br><br>Paul Feig has made some good movies before but this isn't really one of\nthem.

In the\npast anything with a bad review I have watched and enjoyed but this was\nappalling.

I wish I could say something\npositive about the movie but there is nothing.

The ONLY movie I have ever seen where it was well done,\npretty cool to see and actually added something to the movie, was Lost\nIn Space.
