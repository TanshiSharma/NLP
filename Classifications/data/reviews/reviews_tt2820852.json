{"review": "\nBy about 2009 when 'Fast &amp; Furious' was released, the franchise had\nslowly began to veer away from its initial focus of street racing and\ninstead began to turn its attention to the action genre and\nover-the-top big budget sequences. However along with this change of\nstyle, the franchise was actually getting better and better with each\nfilm. Today I saw the most recent instalment in the cinema... talk\nabout action-packed. 'Fast &amp; Furious 7' is a no-holds, over- the-top\nand mindless action film, but this aside, it is an extremely\nentertaining and fun film to watch. With an all-star cast and some\nbrilliant action sequences, 'Fast &amp; Furious 7' is proof that certain\nfranchises can continually make great movies. The most notable moment\nhowever in the entire film is the emotional and respectful ending\nduring the send-off of Paul Walker, the film finishing with a montage\nof Walker in the previous six films, finishing with just two words,\n'For Paul', this is the first time a Fast and Furious film has affected\nme emotionally, and it is arguably the best in the franchise.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw Furious 7 at a SXSW screening. The sudden death of Paul Walker\nshocked his fans and the people who were setting hopes for another F&amp;F\nmovie. Well, James Wan and his crew managed to pull it together using\nCGI and stunt doubles. I have to say, it was a bigger stake here than\nFurious 6, which felt more bang- bang than a GOOD movie. If you are\nlooking for little story, more car chases, stupendous action and\nviolence and hot babes, Furious 7 is your ticket. The scenes shot in\nDubai are particularly spectacular, with lush resorts, exotic cars\nbeing driven off hotel rooftops and crashing into an art gallery, ah!\nWhat wonders F7 takes you to! You may know, James Wan from Insidious\nand Saw, and his crazy camera tricks are highlight here. But it comes\nwith a little compromise, the acting, Diesel feels raw, while Rodriguez\nfeels stale and bland. Walker is great, as usual (R.I.P) Tyrese Gibson\nis the worst, with his \"cool guy\" attitude and \"bad boy\" clich\u00e9\ncharacter. Overall, this one last trip as Torretto calls it, is\nrefreshing, bang on and full out spectacular. Furious 7 deserves to be\nwatched.\n"},
{"review": "\nI watched this movie first day, first show. It started with a bang and\nended with a bang, and in a way that would have crumbled even hearts of\nsteel.<br><br>This has everything one might need in a blockbuster movie. There were\nsmoking hot chicks, electrifying dialogs, fantastic humor, awe\ninspiring stunts, and a menacing addition - Jason Statham.<br><br>This is a movie which you dare not miss, because if you miss this one\nyou are never going to see another. Be prepared for one last lovely\nbeautiful and thrilling ride ahead of you, that's well worth your time\nand memories.<br><br>In terms of cast and crew, Vin Diesel proves to be the man of the\nseries aided by brilliant performances by Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese\nGibson, Jordana Brewster, and Dwayne Johnson. And finally the\nunforgettable Paul Walker. Walk into the sunset, walk through the\nrain... Walk straight into our hearts, and never abandon our memories\nagain. For Paul... May your soul rest in Peace.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you are expecting this movie to be realistic and logic, then you are\nmaking a huge mistake. Put it in your mind set that these peoples are\nvideo game characters/anime/superheroes and everything will start to\nmake sense.<br><br>I was somehow thought that this movie is going to concentrates more\nabout Han's death and there's some interesting plot that leads to the\nevent. But nope, thats not how it went as it pretty straight forward\naction movie with no surprising plot and twist.<br><br>For the action, I could not imagine what would they brought after those\ntanks in the 6th movie. And I was not disappointed, free fall cars,\ntower to tower car jumping and the regeneration power of Dominic\nToretto! Talking about the crazy stuff in the movie, how the heck Dom\nis not dead after he drives his car off the cliff? In every movie I see\npeople is sure to die unless the get out of the car somehow. How the\nheck a Somalian terrorist get a military grade helicopter and a jet\npowered Predator drone? And how the hell a 23 years old hacker girl can\njust develops the God's Eye thats are so powerful that CIA become\nabsolute? <br><br>Seriously guys, you need to abandon the world's logic and watch this\nmovie as if you are watching The Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Expecting\nthis movie to be realistic and logic is a great mistake.<br><br>As for the send off scene for Paul Walker, its truly an emotional\nmoments in the movie. For the people who is not a fan to this movie or\ndoesn't even know who Paul Walker is then they probably doesn't get it\nwhats going on here. But for me, I barely holding my tears as I watch\nit. What a long journey it is~ <br><br>For Paul\n"},
{"review": "\nOne of the best action film that exists out there and definitely the\nbest in the Furious series. With death defying stunts and terrific\nvisuals, it is a match made in heaven for petrol-heads. From jumping\ncars off an aircraft to jumping between buildings in Abu Dhabi, it puts\nshivers down your spine! Rock pulling off his signature move to street\nfight between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham and yet one cannot get\nenough of the action. This is pure entertainment at its best. As if\nthis wasn't enough, the tribute to Paul Walker in the end was emotional\nand the best thing about this film. He got a send-off that he deserved!\nThose last scenes cannot be emphasized enough upon. Overall it is the\nbest action flick so far this year. <br><br>\"Whether I'm a quarter mile away or halfway across the world, the most\nimportant people in the room are mi familia.\"\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this movie a couple of days after it had been released. I have\nnoticed over the years the Fast and Furious franchise has become more\nabout the action scenes (especially Fast and Furious 6) than the actual\ncars and street races of the original Fast and Furious films which many\nof us love. Furious 7 creates a great balance of stunts and action\nwhilst also focusing on the cars and the driving skills of the\ncharacters. I feel James Wan and the writers made the correct decision\nin not killing off Paul's character even though the plot had to be\nchanged because of his unfortunate passing. The acting was up to it's\nusual good standard as in all of the movies. Great film 9/10. RIP Paul\nWalker\n"},
{"review": "\nDom's family comes under threat from Deckard Shaw, the brother of the\nfellow they were up against in episode 6. Also, a mysterious government\nfellow pressures them to rescue a hacker who has invented a whizzo bit\nof kit which can spy on anyone on the planet.<br><br>This series started out as rough, tough, cargasm movies, but it has\ngradually morphed via James Bond/Mission Impossible car-based action\nmovies into, at this point, super-hero movies \u0096 Vin Diesel and Jason\nStatham both display levels of invulnerability which Superman would be\nproud of. If you thought the 25 mile airport runway in episode 6 was\nstretching things a bit, wait until you see what happens with the red\ncar in this one. The action is absolutely preposterous, and highly\nentertaining, even if none of it makes any sense at all (the government\nseriously has no operatives that can do this kind of thing, so they\nhave to recruit a bunch of freelance drivers to bale out of a cargo\nplane in their cars? Really?).<br><br>Underwriting the whole thing is the knowledge of Paul Walker's death\nduring production, necessitating rewriting and a variety of tricks to\nbring his character into scenes not filmed at that point. On the whole,\nthis has been fairly well done, and there is little in the way of\nclunky moments when Walker's absence is obvious, which just leaves the\nawareness of his death and how that might impact on the story. Credit\nto the cast and crew for allowing the character to exit the series in a\ndignified and pleasing way, and for adding a moving coda by way of\ntribute which is dramatically fitting, thematically appropriate to the\ncharacter and the saga, and full of obvious love for their lost friend\nand brother.\n"},
{"review": "\nFurious 7 is badass. This movie is way different than the previous\ninstallments, due to James Wan, who was a fantastic director and had\ngreat camera shots in this. The fight scenes were awesome,the Statham\nand Rock fight is one of the best in the whole series. The audience was\ncheering and clapping through the whole film. The movie was also\nhilarious due to the comedic sides of Tyrese and Ludicrous. It was\ninteresting to see how they dealt with Paul Walker,the CGI could've\nbeen better but I loved the way they used archive footage of him.Along\nwith the action, there is a very emotional side to this movie. There\nare certain scenes that are very sad and one of them,Paul actually\nfilmed. Overall,this movie was packed with tons of action,badass\none-liners,and a farewell to an amazing actor and person. Rest in Peace\nPaul Walker.\n"},
{"review": "\nso with fast 7 came the biggest budget yet but also the biggest\nanticipation yet and the acting did not disappoint. The chemistry\nbetween the actors was near perfect and the film flowed well thanks to\nthis. The use of Jason statham could have been better and Dwayne\nJohnson was also widely underused. The fighting scenes did become a\nlittle too fast at times to understand what they were doing and this\nscores against the film.<br><br>Getting into the story and we know its going to be about furious\ntoretto and fast cars but the story seemed a little lost sometimes in\nthe need for more action and you find yourself thinking what is the\nneed for this, a simple story got made complicated for no reason.<br><br>Let me be honest, this film looked astonishing in what they pulled off,\nsome of the scenes were edge of your seat fingernail biting worthy,\nthis film is not about realism, its about coolness and the way some\nsciences played out were breathtaking.<br><br>So overall this film has amazing acting, breathtaking scenes and offers\nyou with amazing entertainment, definitely worth your money\n"},

{"review": "\nAmongst the hype of the death of the incredible Paul Walker, James Wan\nand his crew managed to pull off the brilliance that was the seventh\ninstallment of the Fast and Furious Franchise (Styled as Furious\nSeven.) On a whole, the franchise started out as a small-time,\nhome-bound film regarding street racing and yet as it progressed, the\nfranchise developed into an international action genre, that worked in\nfavor for the films. For this one in particular, (Furious Seven) it was\nan excellent action-packed film peaked with fury and yet well-rounded\noff with a touching tribute in honor of a fallen comrade. And I guess\nthat because these films taught the significance of family and\nsubstance in loyalty it was absolutely shattering as the movie came to\nend, signifying that so did the life and career of Paul Walker, and the\nlegacy he left behind in the character of Brian O' Conner. On the other\nhand, in terms of screenplay and layout of the film, the special\neffects and action sequences were very much over the top bringing vast\nentertainment and a unique feel to the highly grossing and thrilling\nride viewers take along with the cast.

There was something that\nreminded me of my brother in the eyes. Oddly both he and my brother\nwere twisted in fate somehow, for they both were loving individuals who\ndied doing something they loved, at similar ages, leaving loved ones\nbehind.

He uses short cuts so then he\ncan get all of the action in. You can't have long cuts with action\npacked movies because it's very hard to do. My favorite part of the\nmovie would have to be when they were driving through all the buildings\nbecause it is something that is highly unlikely but still looks very\ncool. It's shows how much balls the guys driving the cars have and how\nbad ass they are. They chose very good actors for the characters\nbecause you can't have someone that looks wimpy driving through\nbuildings and racing cars.

There is a full on action sequence where\nhe is literally making an Ong Bak 4 out of this movie but people didn't\nfind time to write about him. I think he was simply awesome. The best\nthing about this movie is Jason who is simply a Pit Bull from UK, a\nlive time bomb, the transporter who can transport you to hell in no\ntime and a very dangerous Killer elite in one...

The part of Ramsey was really good, she\nworked well with the other actors especially Vin. The song choices were\nreally good and they went along with the movie really well.

After the\nsuccess of The Conjuring, Director James Wan has not let me down with\nthe movie. The stunts were fantastic, the views were amazing and acting\nwas above all. The movie is a great tribute to Paul Walker. Apart from\nregular characters, Jason Statham who played the villanious role of\nDeckard Shaw did justice with his role.

If you have seen the first six\nFast and Furious movies, I would highly suggest you see this one, but\nbe ready, you will need some tissues at the end! <br><br>The cast of Fast and Furious 7 said that it was from Walker and Fast\nand Furious 8 is for (Paul). This movie portrayed how much their lives\nhave changed over the years. <br><br>I went with my family to see this movie and I would recommend it to any\nfamily who loves action, or has seen the previous six movies. This\nmovie will not disappoint you! It will make you want to watch the next\none and see what happens next! It will leave you filled with suspense\nand will make you value family more. <br><br>The end of the movie will bring you to tears, as Vin Diesel says to\nPaul \"I used to say I live my life a quarter mile at a time and I think\nthat's why we were brothers - because you did too. No matter where you\nare, whether it's a quarter mile away or halfway across the world,\nyou'll always be with me.

{"review": "\nI will admit that I'm not a massive fan of the Fast &amp; Furious\nfranchise, but Fast &amp; Furious 7 was a real treat in the early days of\n2015.

I'll admit, I was tearing up at that point.<br><br>Jason Statham also kills it in this movie. I've admired his acting\nskills, but I think this is the movie that I am going to remember him\nfrom the most out of every movie he's done. He is a good actor, but as\nthe main villain in this movie, Deckard Shaw, I thought he delivered\nthe most.<br><br>Overall, I had a blast with Fast &amp; Furious 7, it was exciting and\nemotional, it made us all laugh and cry. I have listened to that song\nby Charlie Puth and Wiz Khalifa \"See You Again\" so many times, I love\nthat song, it's a perfect way to carry the film's emotional tribute to\nPaul Walker and to give him the perfect send-off.<br><br>For Paul 9.9/10\n"},

{"review": "\nThis was the 7th fast and the furious film (obviously) and when most\nfranchises never reach that many movies and it's surprising this\nfranchise has and even more so that it is a great movie. Vin Diesel\nuses the word family a lot in this film and it is fitting as one of the\nbest things in the film is the crews chemistry and relationship it did\nreally work as they felt like a family. They act like one to they love\neach other but disguise it by making fun of each other and having a\ngreat laugh during the most dangerous situations. The films Villain was\na great one having a great performance for Jason Statham as Deckard\nShaw (Is Deckard even a real name by the way?). He was so villainous\nand bad ass as he not only had the courage to fight the Rock but beat\nhim. Unfortunately he was really underused. The Gods-eye plot wasn't as\ninteresting as the revenge plot and it did drag on a bit. The ending\nwas perfect for want it needed to be the final fight with Deckard Shaw\nand his men was a really well done action scene. It also had in my\nopinion the best line in the movie \"Did you think this was going to be\na street fight..... You're god-damn right it is\". The emotional end\nscene with Diesel and Walker was so sad and really felt like a fitting\nend to the series which I really think it should have been. I know I\nhaven't talked about Paul Walker that much in this review but to be\nperfectly honest I wasn't a huge Paul Walker fan don't get me wrong he\nwas a really good actor but I haven't seen him in much other than these\nmovies so I didn't feel the sadness that so many other people felt when\nhe died. But in the end other than the fact some elements dragged on a\nbit and the underused villain I loved this movie and in the end was the\nsecond best movie in the franchise (I thought 6 was just a little bit\nbetter) and one of the best movies of 2015\n"},

As always, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker do a great job along with\nDwayne Johnson, who entered the franchise from fast five.

If you are a die\nhard fast and furious fan I really don't think that you could be\ndisappointed by furious seven. Paul Walker as everyone knows died in\nthe past year and in the end of the film they did a small tribute to\nhim featuring the song by Wiz Khalifa see you again. A lot of people in\nthe theater got very emotional including me just because he was such a\ngreat guy and a great character in the fast and furious franchise, I\nwas very glad that they recognized him! We do have some new comers to\nthe franchise including Jason Statham and Kurt Russell, and I felt that\nboth used their screen time wisely and portrayed their character very\nwell. I was very impressed with Jason Statham, he always does action\nmovies that's his typecast, but I felt in this role he really portrayed\na great villain for the film! Kurt Russell did a great job as a member\nof the crew that is trying to take down Statham. One thing is for sure,\nyou will never be bored with this film, it is high-octane, it is full\nof action, it has great dialogue, even if you're not a die-hard fast\nand furious fan, I still think you will be very pleased with this film!\nI think it's just the right found that Paul Walker needed to say\ngoodbye, it is going to be hard to see anymore of the films in the\nfranchise without Paul Walker, I just hope they don't kill off his\ncharacter, I hope they retire his character respectively, without\nkilling him off. 9/10 for Furious Seven! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n"},

Also coming into play is a international spy plot\ninvolving a highly innovative tracking system that could be dangerous\nin the hands of mercenaries. The thing right now with the Fast And\nFurious movies is that you can mix the cars with the most crazy of\nplots and it works.

Personally I\nfelt it to be a one-time watch movie. <br><br>If you have watched all the previous chapters of Fast and Furious\nfranchise, you need to watch it. In fact, you would not even think of\nnot watching it. Isn't it? <br><br>Overall, it was two hours of entertainment.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis was first movie in the Fast and Furious franchise that I have ever\nseen. I am not a Vin Diesel or Paul Walker fan or a fan of action\nmovies. Having said all that, I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this movie! It was\nexciting from beginning to end and it held my attention throughout the\nentire movie. I laughed, jumped, cringed, and even shed a tear, at the\nend. I left the movie smiling, feeling good, and wanting to see it\nagain. I was pleasantly surprised and immediately searched the internet\nto find all the information I could about Diesel and Walker. Any movie\nthat captivates you and sparks your interest to the point that you feel\ncompelled to research the characters/actors, I feel, has done a pretty\ngood job of selling you on the storyline.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is by far one of the best ones yet. Its action packed and full of\nsuspense. There are so many parts where you just want to jump out of\nyour seat because of the pure awesomeness and excitement. And there is\nalso the tear jerking parts a couple times in the movie but all is\nstill awesome. The movie is a fair lengthy movie so you will be getting\nwhat you paid for. Make sure you a friend with you too, either to cry\non or to scream with when the excitement comes. What ever you saw in\nthe previews was nothing compared to actually watching the movie . I\nhighly recommend this as its not only my favorite movie series but also\nanother job well done.\n"},
{"review": "\nRidiculous, over the top, and somehow fantastic, Furious 7 is another\nvery very fun installment in the franchise. It's crazy how Five, Six,\nand now 7 are all considered the best installments. How often can you\nget quality films 5, 6, and 7 movies deep? The dialogue is a bit\nstilted at times, and there are moments when the CGI Paul Walker is\npretty noticeable, but for the most part, this is a very well-done\nfilm. James Wan brings incredible vision and skillful direction to the\nfranchise. I can only imagine the woes this production underwent as a\nresult of one of its main stars, and while the ending clearly was added\nlater on, it is basically perfect. I can't think of a more tasteful way\nthey could have handled things. Without spoilers, this is a very loving\ntribute to Paul Walker. His presence is felt throughout the whole\nmovie, but the ending especially really hits close to home and weighs\nheavy in the spirit of Paul. I think he would have been proud. It will\nbe interesting to see where they are going to take things from here,\nand especially whether or not this will be as successful minus one of\nthe leads. After the excellence of Furious 7, I'm definitely ready for\nwhatever they are going to churn up next, even though the way this\nended felt like a very fitting conclusion for the franchise as a whole.\n"},

As Vin posted on his\nFacebook; You turned the world into a one big family. This movie will\nbe the highest-grossing of the franchise. Kurt Russel did a very good\njob. Dwayne being Dwayne, Tyrese being Tyrese. Everybody played for\nPaul. I can't imagine what Vin and Cody feeled when they separated\ntheir ways. Man that was so hard. I will watch it over and over again\nwhen it drops to the net. Looking forward for 8. But it won't be a big\nsuccess like this one. Rest in Paradise, Race in Paradise Pablo. Vin\nhonored his brother by naming her daughter after him. No matter what\nhappens, we will never forget you. I will build a time machine and save\nhim. Hopefully it will work. Jason Statham being himself again. For me,\nplot is unimportant, family is everything. But every time I listen to\nSee You Again, I try to hold my tears, but I can't.

This move does exactly that for me.<br><br>The movie is jammed packed with action, from start to finish. The\nstunts, as always, are just out of this world.

I\ndread to think what your review would be on the Terminator franchise\nLOL <br><br>For me, the acting was again superb by all of the main cast.

Not only in this franchise but also in any other\nfilm I have seen him in. He was a very big talent and will be greatly\nmissed in the industry.

Now I realize the films weren't original meant to be tied\ntogether back 10 years ago but I find it funny how it's seems to ignore\nwhat happened in the Tokyo drift ending and the used the scene anyway.\nSeems very odd. Tell me if anyone else noticed.<br><br>Y'all feel me<br><br>Even when I'm wrong I get my point across\n"},
{"review": "\nIn my opinion Fast 7 is the best one in the series then Fast 5 and then\nFast 6 but let me tell you why when we all heard about Paul Walker\npassing away we all got emotional and it was sad hearing about a young\nman loosing his life like that so the Fast &amp; Furious family decided to\nbring Paul's brothers to finish the movie and yes it's pretty obviously\nspotting the cgi but does it matter at this point? Also there are 2\ngreat additions to the series now one is Kurt Russell who nailed it and\nof course Jason Statham easily the best thing of this movie the\nproblems that i had with this movie was the final fight and when the\nstreet started falling apart it felt unreleastic but also it felt like\n2 robots started fighting instead of 2 bald action heroes. Another\nthing that bugged me is that Dwayne Johnson doesn't have a big role in\nthis one and i hate that because he's easily the best new character\nfrom the last 3 films. Now let's talk about the ending man this and\nTerminator 2 will make even a 70 year old man cry i mean really my eyes\nstarted going dry and nobody should be ashamed for that and the way\nthey chose to say goodbye to Paul was so touching especially with that\ngreat song and i still think that making a Fast &amp; Furious 8, 9 and 10\nis stupid cause nobody feels like there should be anything after this\ncause the way it ends let's not turn the series into Friday The 13th\nplease Hollywood. Anyways in the end Fast &amp; Furious 7 is a really\nreally great movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am a big fan of the fast&amp;furious movies, I cried a lot when I learned\nabout Paul's death!!!!This film was great, lot of shooting scenes,lot\nof car racing scenes as always and cars skydiving....!At the end of the\nfilm when the see you again started playing I cried a lot and it was a\nvery emotional scene! F&amp;F7 is a great film and no one should miss it!\nVin Diesel and the other f&amp;f crew made Paul's last movie the best f&amp;f\nmovie, and because Paul hadn't shoot a lot of important scenes, they\nbrought his 2 brothers so as to complete the film by using photo-shop\neffects on their faces so as to look like him! I cant understand why a\nlot of people hate this film!\n"},
{"review": "\nThrough most of the movie I was waiting for the tragic death of Paul\nWalker's character. It says something about the franchise that they\ndidn't go that way. That instead the movie gave Paul Walkers character\na kind of happy ending. The movie itself became more of a tribute to\nhim and in so doing that lifted itself out of a mere action movie into\nsomething more. Yes there are the usual things you see in the\nfranchise. This is a high octane action movie after all. There is a\nscene where you literally see a car flying from one building to the\nnext. Hell flying cars is what made this franchise famous. Like every\nversion of the franchise it has its flaws. However if you like Fast &amp;\nFurious movies I would highly recommend this one. If for nothing else\nthen to say goodby to Paul Walker.\n"},
{"review": "\nIn no way am I a fan of the \"Fast and the Furious\" franchise, but these\nlast two \"Fast and the Furious\" films were great. Like me, even if you\naren't a fan of these \"Fast and the Furious\" films you'll love this\none. Like \"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" this film was loaded with action. It\nwasn't like some action films that has a lot of dry spots. From\nbeginning to the end this film keeps it's audience interested just from\nthe action alone. The small amount of drama that takes place is a\nlittle clich\u00e9, but it works in this film. Now of course like all \"Fast\nand the Furious\" films the dialog and the plot is nothing Oscar worthy\nbut the action and the bond these characters share in this film makes\nup for that ten times fold and that's one of the things that makes this\nfilm so great, the fact that the Furious 7 is a family.\n"},
{"review": "\nFast? Of course, Furious? Certainly. was it what I expected,\ndefinitely. Would I watch it again, no doubt. but was it the best yet,\narguably.<br><br>Stunned as I was to see the that Paul Walker lasted the entire film. It\nwasn't the most shocking twist I've seen, yes it was an unbelievable\nfilm, yes I regret in slating it in the slightest but honestly, there\nwas a lot of the same things, the romance, the action and the very long\nfight scenes. <br><br>I just felt this year they could of added more. Yes it was an\nimprovement from last year, ever so slightly and I feel this was only\ndue to the amazing ending that payed tribute to Paul Walker, but other\nthan that it was played safe. <br><br>Not one of Vin diesels ''family'' died not even the villain (Jason\nStatham) died. It worked last year with Vin Diesel just making it out\nalive, but again. Really. <br><br>A lot got carried over from the previous fast and furious', a lot we\nhave already seen before and nothing really got tied up at the end of\nthis one. Which leaves us wanting more, that's amazing I'm the first to\nadmit it. I just wish more lose ends were tied, before they start the\nroad to the next one. <br><br>Again we are already waiting on number eight and I didn't want to feel\nlike that this year. Although I am complaining about the fact it is\nopened doors for another fast and furious, which excites me just typing\nit, this film was excellent and did keep my immersed through the\nentirety. <br><br>I was just waiting on that moment where I thought it really did get me,\nthat wasn't what I was expecting. Maybe I hyped it up far to much, or\nmaybe it was the stepping stone to an unbelievable ending to the\nfranchise.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt took 7 Fast and Furious movies before I actually sat down and\nwatched a whole movie. I had seen bits and pieces of others but this\none was my first. It teaches me that you can save the world with fast\ncars, lots of bikini clad females, and long stares by the actors. This\nstory sets off with an explosive chase, the crew is brought back\ntogether to save the world against an evil forces. They move fast, talk\nfast, and act fast. But in the end, the need for speed is clear and\nthis is one tale that will keep your head spinning. This movie is an\nadventure that will keep you going. I hate to say it, but I am ready\nfor Fast and Furious 8 and go back to see the foundations. Dr Wilson\nTrivino\n"},
{"review": "\nIts very hard to criticize this movie even if you want to. It is a\ncommendable an effort by the whole team to bring a great tribute to one\nof their family members, Paul Walker. We were quite clear of the\nmagnitude of this movie when they showed Statham at the end of 6th\npart. So the expectations were high. Though the story isn't that great,\nthe team tries its best to keep the audience entertained. Since there\nare lot of big stars in this movie, the director makes sure everyone\nhas substantial role even if it isn't necessary sometimes. Jason\nStatham entry scene is epic. This movie stays true to the initial Fast\nand Furious movies when it comes to cars and to the latest parts when\nit comes to outrageous action scenes. But who is complaining?<br><br>This is probably the movie with most emotional touch after the death of\na leading actor. The Paul Walker tribute moves anyone in tears.\nEspecially the last scene, wow... its just.. very hard to describe.\nSuch a great way to retire a character. I can see how difficult it\nwould have been the actors to perform in scenes without actually Paul\nbeing there. I wish the rivalry between Vin Diesel and Statham would\nhave had much more magnitude. Nathalie Emmanuel is hot and impressive.\nTyrese Gibson has everyone in splits as always. But remember, its Paul\nWalker who not only steals your show but also your hearts with his\nsuperhuman presence. All I can say is \"Thank you team and Miss you\nPaul\".\n"},
{"review": "\nwhat can i say , i expected less but i was surprised to that new level\nof action i saw . for the whole time i couldn't catch my breath . its\nadrenaline packed its like watching a semi final soccer game . and\nobviously the movie was dedicated to Paul Walker may his soul rest in\npeace. they made a hero out of him he was the one coming up with plans\nand doing lot of action sense probably more than vin diesel him self. i\nloved it , some may find it failed but it brought a whole new level for\nthese kinds of movies. the directing , filming , sound effects and\neverything was good but ya it involved lot of violence sense like more\nthan what it needed to be that at a certain stage you forget what is\nthe movie about whats the story ..\n"},
{"review": "\nbeautiful how they split ways respect for the tribute glad they didn't\ngo James bond or wait...the bus... its mechanical evolution right? good\njob I'm glad u didn't went overboard on that but sad to see you did not\n...kinda mixed feelings all i can say about this movie but its kinda\npersonal semi spoiler&gt; Dom vs Jason ...no freaking way ... besides that\ni think they captured all of it i was kinda skeptic but they did it!\ngood storyline! they prove me wrong kinda embarrassed cause i voted\nf2f2 100cars garage part! they didn't only recapture old school stuff\nthey made it better good job guys RIP Brian see you on the other side\nill race 4 yah\n"},
{"review": "\nI have never been so wowed at incredible action scenes after coming out\nof the theatre. This is definitely the best fast and furious and one of\nthe best movies of all time. There isn't much dialogue in furious 7 but\nthat doesn't matter. Everyone is great in their roles : Vin Diesel as\nDom Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian Oconnor, The Rock as Hobbs, Jason\nStatham as Deckard Shaw, Michelle Rodriguez as Letty, Natalie Emmnuel\nas Ramsey, Ludicrous as Tej and Kurt Russel as Mr. nobody. I'm not\nexaggerating when I'm saying they all played their roles incredibly\nwell. The best thing about Furious 7 is the action, it's just amazing.\nThe Abu Dhabi scene where a car flies from skyscraper to skyscraper is\namazing as well as the parachuting car bus assault and the incredible\nfinal drone chase. Deckard Shaw is the greatest villain ever. I feel\ncompelled to repeat that the action is phenomenal. This is also a great\nPaul Walker tribute because his face-off against that acrobatic dude is\nawesome and the way they just made him retire instead of killing him is\na great way to solve the problem. The story which has a lot to do with\nhackers is brilliantly told and god's eye is a great concept. I only\nhave 2 minor complaints : the action scenes were a bit too long\nsometimes and there wasn't enough of Sean Boswell and his awesome Texas\naccent. There were so many awesome memorable quotes like : \"I don't got\nfriends, I got family\", \"I am the cavalry\" etc. The movie even succeeds\nat being funny every once in a while. Ramsey was a great character\naddition as well as Mr. nobody. THIS MOVIE IS JUST AWESOME AND I CAN'T\nGET OVER THE ACTION SEQUENCES!!!!! SO EPIC!!!!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie, I must say was amazing, I watched it on the 10th of April\nand might I say, the producers did an amazing job for the fact that one\nof their main characters for the movie passed away. Even though they\nused Paul Walker's brothers to fill in for him and they used special\ntechnology, to make them sound like him and and to obviously look like\nhim, you can rarely tell that it is someone else playing the part, what\ngives it away is the size of his brother, because obviously everyone\nhas a different body size,so when they filmed certain parts with his\nbrother, you can pick it out and say yes that wasn't actually Paul\nWalker, but other than that it was good. What I think they should have\ndone was filmed more with Shawn (from Tokyo drift), as I think if they\nmixed him in with the gang, it could have been good and it could have\nbeen something different. But overall this movie was AMAZING and\ntowards the end it was very emotional!\n"},
{"review": "\nHave you seen the other 6 FAST &amp; FURIOUS movies? At the very least have\nyou seen Furious 5 &amp; 6? If so, and you liked them, then you're going to\nlike this film. If you did not, then you probably aren't reading this\nreview, so it doesn't really matter.<br><br>I really enjoy these movies. They have developed a rhythm that is fun\nto watch. The car scenes are...well...fast and furious, while the\naction and mayhem is over-the-top \"cartoony\" fun - where everyone walks\naway with maybe a cut and a scrape (that look really cool), unless the\nplot calls for a broken bone or - heaven forbid - a death.<br><br>But what drives these movies are the performance - and camaraderie - of\nour core group of heroes. It is this sense of \"family\" that really\ncreates a place where you want to spend time with this group of people.\nVin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Chris \"Ludacris\"\nBridges, Tyrese Gibson and Michelle Rodriguez know what kind of movie\nthey are in and look like they had fun making it. Add to this group,\nold pros Jason Statham and Kurt Russell (!) and the acting and\ncharacters are well taken care of.<br><br>I have to admit that I was distracted while watching this film with the\nknowledge that star Paul Walker passed away in a car accident in the\nmiddle of filming this movie. I know they had to \"digitally insert\" him\nin a few scenes and had his brother be a body double throughout. Could\nI tell when they did that? I think so, but don't know for sure. It is a\nsad thing and, for me, that added a melancholy shade to the whole\nproceedings. To give the filmmakers credit, I thought they were smart\non how they wrote his character out of what are sure to be future\ninstallments of this wildly popular, cash cow, money-making franchise.<br><br>Check your brain at the door and escape for 2 hours into the world of\nFurious 7, you'll be glad you did.<br><br>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)\n"}
