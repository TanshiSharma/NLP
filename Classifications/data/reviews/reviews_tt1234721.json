{"review": "\nI really don't understand all the hate this movie gets. Yeah, I get it,\nit's a reboot of a perfectly good 80s movie that nobody really wanted,\nbut it's a really good one! I expected a mindless Micheal Bayian action\nmovie and what I got was a really smart, interesting and entertaining\nlook at trans-humanism, the freedom of choice, politics and\nrecklessness in corporate leaders.<br><br>This movie really dives into the question of how a person could live\nhis day to day live with almost all of his body amputated and stuck\ninside of a machine. So when people complain about the uncomfortable\nscenes between Murphy and his wife, I can only imagine they mean what\nhappened after his transformation, and that felt exactly the way it was\nsupposed to!<br><br>So yes, the original is way more graphic and still holds up to this day\nas a gruesome action flick, but this one is smart and interesting and\nreally is a good movie in it's own right.<br><br>And by no means is it as bad as people say it is!\n"},
{"review": "\nI love Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop from 1987 (which remains iconic) and I\nusually don't like reboots. But watching the new one I never got rid of\nthe feeling, that the remake is worth it. It is a whole new\ninterpretation, that sets the focus on the topics of our time: robots,\ndrones, the human aspect behind the technology, media critics, war\npropaganda. I felt, the movie has a mission to enlighten people and I\nliked that. It became even more obvious how much the RoboCop story\nexists within the topos of Frankenstein which is the story about the\nhuman devilment and the lack of respect of life. That's why Padilha\ngives Murphy more of a face, a life and feelings.<br><br>Beside that the pictures, the sound, the music is pretty contemporary.\nYou probably have to make some compromises today to get the millions to\nget the flick done. It won't become iconic, but it's the right time for\nthe right message in the right movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nBy 7, it really means a 7.5/10. Not sure what's with the negative\nreviews, but I enjoyed the movie very much. It's well-executed and the\ndirection was clear and crisp. There's no distinct feel-good actions\nscenes because the pacing is kept constant throughout and I don't see\nwhy there's an issue with the pacing being that way. It's hardly flat,\nit's just a very honest, straight- flushed story-telling, and it fits\nthe themes that are underscored by the movie. Alex Murphy is a\nreluctant hero and he's ultimately a father and a husband whose\npersonal agenda serves as his existential core. I like how these themes\nare teased out and zoomed in upon throughout the movie. Also, there are\nsome absolutely delicious production details and CGIs that are just\nabsolutely feasts to the eye. Not to mention the superb cast and the\nwonderful performances. I think this is a honest and loyal reboot that\nwill appeal to fans of Robocop who fell in love with the story\nprecisely for the moralistic themes it explores.\n"},
{"review": "\nI just don't see, why any other recent science fiction movie deserves\nmore respect than this one. The story is fluent, the characters are\nwell built, everyone has its own motive. Yes film is more of a personal\nstruggle journey of the main character and that is what I like. For the\nfans of action it is also good, why when (quite often) there is, it is\ngood one. The effects are quality mastership. The most memorable scene\nis when Murphy sees what he has become.For my regards it has some\nphilosophical connotation to, because it also concerns the influence of\ntechnology to the society. It clearly shows bads and goods. I recommend\nwatching this movie for\n"},

Just do yourself a favour and don't waste your time on Robo\n2014, search out the original Robocop. You won't be disappointed.

I won't go into spoilers, but my biggest issue with the trailer\nwas the fact that Murphy knows from the beginning what they did to him,\nno memory erase and all. Well, I have to say that they are actually\nhandling this very well in the film and it's not that simple. It\nactually sets the tone for the impressive second half of the movie.<br><br>During the first half of the movie I was like \"OK, it's a nice film but\nnot near what the first film accomplished\". Well, it's like they heard\nme, because the second half feels pretty much like the old ones!<br><br>The script uses actually some of the best concepts of the first two\nfilms. Joel Kinnaman does a pretty good job as both Alex Murphy and\nRobocop. He doesn't manage to steal the impression that Peter Weller\nmade of course, but he truly does a good job. I hope we see more of him\nin the future. <br><br>All in all, to all those who, like me, had low expectations from this\nfilm: give it a chance. It's much better than what the abysmal trailers\nlet you think. By the way, what is it with awful trailers to good films\nlately?

This remake however is really clean, and all\nof the tech is tight, and realistic in it's seamless melding with the\nnear future, with such a perfect cast making sure not to miss any of\nthe Iconic lines, though not being afraid to be a new, and different\nmovie. I don't need to tell you who is in it, I don't need to tell you\nwhat it is about, though the back story in this version of the story is\nfar more fleshed out, and there is less emphasis on the partnership,\nand more on family, but it is stronger this way for sure.

Also, the plot structure from the\noriginal is almost entirely gutted and an inferior one put in its\nplace. It is cringe-worthy. Moreover, the film also lacks conflicts\nthat are needed for a story to even exist. Kurtwood Smith did an\namazing portrayal of a central villain in the original. This one\nhas...Samuel L. Jackson? He's not even the villain, just an annoying\nhost of a show, he's supposed to portray conservative media forces or\nwhatnot. Lastly, Alex, the central character himself...where is his\nconflict? The original film had him trying to come to grips with who he\nwas, and how he could get back home. Here, in 2014, Alex has none of\nthat to drive the film forward.

It is not that this\nfilm tries to be something it is not, it is simply not even trying to\nbe anything. yes, it is just that bad and I am not exaggerating.<br><br>The story is such garbage that makes you wondering if the director Jose\nPadilha even understood the original story line and when will these\ndirectors understand that such shaky camera work and Call Of Duty FPS\nview is NOT appreciated?<br><br>The only thing I can come up with which was not a total failure was the\nacting of Joel Kinnaman but unfortunately his part in the movie was too\nbrief. Samuel L. Jacksons acting on the other hand, as pathetic as his\nrole in \"snake in a plane\". Usually in such movies you want to see a\nvillain that is memorable that get you on your toes but none of the\nvillains in this movie had such characteristics.<br><br>I wish someone takes Jose Padilhas ELITE SQUAD and makes a pink panther\nlike remake of it.<br><br>To sum up: do not spend any money/time for this flick.\n"},

How boring, lame, and unrealized. Not violent, not even exciting.\nStupid comes to mind. We spent 20 minutes building up the characters, a\nbit long but knowing the action will come I am still alright, then\nMurphy goes down in the weakest, most pathetic way. OK, its over, move\non, make Robocop and then let him kick arse. Now, we spend the next\nhour and 15 minutes in a political drama about robots in our community\nand training Robocop. Nothing of note happens here. NOTHING. So now, we\nhave watched one hour and 35 minutes and still NO ACTION. Just a couple\nof bad guys get caught very boring like. <br><br>Then, Robocop goes after the guy that put him down originally. The most\nANTICLIMACTIC SCENE in the history of revenge scenes. WAIT FOR IT..\nWere not done. Robocop learns that some cops are bad, which of course\nwe knew from the opening scene of the movie. So he goes after them,\ncaptures them without a fight. <br><br>WAIT FOR IT - we learn there is a higher cop calling some shots\u0085 Again,\nno fight, captured..<br><br>WAIT FOR IT - now, the company wants to terminate Robocop cause he has\nhuman within him.. So he goes after the heads of the company, again, NO\nACTION\u0085 Its over.. <br><br>This film was only good looking visually, but there is barely ANY\nACTION..

{"review": "\nTaking Robocop as a work of science fiction means that it should be\ninterpreted not only as a warning sign of things to come, but as an an\nallegory of what is happening right now.

To this end, the setting up of the movie\nworks well and picks up themes not present in the original. It is\nchilling to see Murphy in his condition, and think \"that's us\". <br><br>However, from here on the directions taken are less than satisfactory.\nRobocop does not seem to say anything really new or insightful about\nthis human condition. The message is that we can go far, but should not\ngo \"too far\": a science-fiction clich\u00e9. Most of the opportunities for\ntrue commentary are missed. The irreverent humour of the original is\nmissing, replaced with a tired critique of USA as the world police\nsomething-something. Surely an acceptable target by now.

Now\nthe guy they got to play Murphy was not a decent actor and it really\nshows when we try to sympathise with the character of Murphy, but he\ndoes a pretty good when being the emotionless Robocop and he does a\ngood job with the action scenes that is necessary in a film like this.\nThe supporting cast is also pretty good with Gary Oldman being\nfantastic in the film as the scientist who puts Robocop together and he\nseems to be the one who is doing the best with his acting ability.\nMichele Keaton is in this film as the head of the corporation and he\ndoes a really good job in this film as he really plays a few different\ntypes of character in this film and he does a great job in it. The head\ninstructor is also good in the film and he looks like he is having fun\nin his role, the only negative is the woman who plays Murphy's wife\nisn't that great and she doesn't seem to have the acting chops for the\nrole. The story is alright with the corporate background scenes being\ncool and a realistic addition to the film that provided a nice backdrop\nand Murphy's story comes to a good conclusion. However, I thought his\nstory was pretty lacklustre and it didn't show enough Robocop action.\nThe script is alright with Oldman and Keaton's dialogue being good and\nJay Baruchel providing some funny moments but Murphy's lines are so\nbasic and stoic it hurts the film.

Gary\nOldman was fantastic and Joel Kinnaman held his own as the half man\nhalf machine Robocop. While it may seem to start off a little slow the\nsecond half of the movie rocks and the last 20 minutes is an adrenaline\nrush with terrific action. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and look\nforward to another installment of this version of Robocop.\n"},
{"review": "\nAlright. No one wanted a remake of the 1987 original, but you know\nwhat? It happened and it wasn't a total disaster. In my opinion, it\nmade some improvement over the original. Gory , R-Rating? Non- existent\nin the 2014 remake. The Verhoeven signature violence isn't what always\nmakes a good movie.<br><br>I liked the 1987 Robocop. But after watching it a couple of times. It's\nreally just an action movie with little bits of political/social satire\nas well as some character development of Alex Murphy. In the 2014\nremake, the screenwriter clearly wanted to explore the idea of putting\na man in a machine. If you paid attention to the dialogue between the\nscientists and executives of OmniCorp, they were talking about some\nimportant stuff about human consciousness and the difference between a\nhuman and a robot. There's also satire in the movie as well. We get a\nfew scenes of Samuel L. Jackson playing the host of a talk show called\nThe Novak Element which seems to have a Pro-Robot bias, favoring the\nOmniCorp CEO than the anti-machine politicians. The political satire\nvexed into the script made me think about now. How Americans are\nagainst the use of drones and surveillance technology in our home but\nare okay when used abroad to look for terrorist. It does raise\nquestions on using advanced technology to stop crime. The remake\ndefinitely made Robocop a little more relevant today.<br><br>Robocop 2014 is not a perfect film though. There are a couple of\ndownsides. I felt that there were not a lot of scenes of the bad guy\nthat almost killed Murphy. We don't know too much about him but he was\npart of a conspiracy. I also thought they should have developed the\ncharacter of Alex Murphy a little more.<br><br>So let me get this straight. We don't want remakes of old films that\nwere considered good. But hey, this one did it's best. Robocop 2014 is\nmuch better than the Total Recall 2012 remake.\n"},

I was hoping to see something\ndifferent I think. But the more I thought about the movie and even\nthough he had to make it a PG-13 movie (still hoping there will be an\nextended cut), the themes are there. It's not a Jesus analogy anymore,\nbut the movie does acknowledge the Paul Verhoeven classic. We still get\nmore than a few new notions. Samuell L. Jacksons \"news\" reporter being\none of them. The biggest propaganda since ... well another \"news\"\nchannel in America that tells us it is fair and balanced (even if\nwasn't meant as a direct assault on that station, it's easy to make\nthat comparison, because it's true).<br><br>You also get Michael Keaton in superb form, having as much fun as he\ncan. Gary Oldman gives his best too, though I guess some will have some\nissues with the main actor. It would be unfair to do so, but you could\nsee their point.

{"review": "\nI was part of the generation who remembers those 80s movies that are\nbecoming re-made, re-fashioned, and re-booted. There was no need to\nremake Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Friday The !3th. So, I\nwas skeptical and had my mind made up to skip this movie because the\noriginal is already a good movie. I'm glad I didn't skip this one\nbecause it does something rare you don't really see in movies, it\nactually entertains and keeps your attention. The story is the same, a\ncop is shot and left for dead, then rebuilt into a cyborg law man. I\nfound this to actually stand on it's own two feet with some clever\nspecial effects and action. Joe Kinnaman makes Robocop human and his\nperformance is compatible to Peter Weller. In my opinion, had there not\nbeen an original film made in 1987, this movie would be okay on it's\nown.

{"review": "\nNot going to lie, when I saw the first teaser I wanted to hate this\nmovie. The original is just such a classic.

While I love\neverything about the first one; the effects, the one liners, the\nviolence,and the campiness, I didn't find myself comparing the new one\nto the old one when I watched it. <br><br>In my opinion, the new additions to the story really help make it more\nof a complete story, one based closer to our current reality than the\noriginal movie was. Nothing felt forced and there was a much better\nexplanation for why everything was happening and certain key players\nmotivations.<br><br>It's definitely not the fun campy movie it once was, but it throws out\na few fun nods to the classic. I found this movie to have more heart,\nand for a man to truly control his robot side I think still having a\nsoul defines his humanity.<br><br>The action was top notch. Most of the CGI looked very natural, and the\nfight scenes were intense. I really liked what they did with his suit\nthis time around. I know on these boards a lot of people have said they\nmissed how Robocop moved in the original, saying it seemed more\nrobotic, I would say they have very outdated ideas of how robots\nfunction these days. I personally work for an engineering company that\nspecializes in motion control systems, and have taken Uni level\nrobotics courses. In my opinion they did a fantastic job with making\nRobocop walk and function like a modern day robot/machine. There was a\ncertain mechanical fluidity that just looked right.<br><br>I wouldn't go in expecting the old Robocop, but I found this new\nRobocop to be one the most enjoyable action movies I've seen in a\nwhile.

It's like you can imagine that this scenario may really happen\nin the future.<br><br>This is really refreshing for me, and I enjoyed this movie a lot, every\nsingle second of it.<br><br>Way to go! 10/10 from me!

{"review": "\nThe trailers for this movie made it look like a generic reboot to a\nbeloved action movie. So I avoided RoboCop 2014 for a long time,\nmissing it's theatrical release. I finally got to see it on Netflix and\nI gotta say, not only did I prefer it to the original, but it's one of\nthe most pleasant surprises Hollywood's given me in years.<br><br>This movie isn't a pointless remake as I was lead to believe. It's an\nupdate done right. Instead of focusing on redoing the story of the\noriginal with updated special effects the new RoboCop goes deeper into\nthe psyche of a man who's essentially had most of his body replaced by\nmachinery. It makes you question what makes a man human. Is there a\nsoul in the machine? <br><br>POTENTIAL SPOILERS<br><br>And the answer comes in the form of Murphy's family, whether he can\nbreak free of his corporately controlled body and use his human mind to\nsave those dear to him. <br><br>It also brings up important political issues concerning robots in the\nmiddle east (a metaphor for the U.S. drone striking that part of the\nworld), and your usual anti-corporate slant that's so prevalent in the\ncyberpunk sub genre of science fiction.<br><br>The amount of action feels just right. The cgi isn't overdone. Overall\nit isn't a full on action movie like the original, it's a true science\nfiction movie that explores themes relevant to our times. It goes above\nand beyond the common blockbuster. And for that it deserves some\nattention for what it's accomplished. I'd like to see more science\nfiction in modern cinema since the future is looking more and more like\nscience fiction with each passing day but for now this is a good start.\n"},
{"review": "\nYesterday,I watched RoboCop.RoboCop is an action film directed by Jos\u00e9\nPadilha.The film stars Joel Kinnaman(Charles Joel Nordstr\u00f6m) in the\ntitle role ,with Gary Oldman ,Michael Keaton ,Abbie Cornish ,Samuel L.\nJackson ,Jackie Haley ,Patrick Garrow ,Michael K. Williams and John\nRuttan in supporting roles.<br><br>The story is about future of America.Raymon Sellars(Michael Keaton) is\nAmerican entrepreneur,he is owner of the robot company.Led by CEO\nRaymond Sellars, the company moves to market , but the passage of the\nDreyfus Act, forbidding deployment of drones on U.S. soil, prevents\nthis.Sellars asks Dr. Dennett Norton(Gary Oldman) and his research team\nto create an alternative.They decided to make a RoboCop(man-robot).A\nDetroit police detective, Alex Murphy, is chosen for the job after he\nis critically injured in a car bomb explosion arranged by crime boss\nAntoine Vallon.<br><br>The character of James Murphy(RoboCop) is really interesting because we\nhave different types of him.At the start we have him as policeman with\nfamily and they were living happy life and then he became a\nrobot(because of explosion) ,that was shocking for his family,but his\nwife and son accepted him as robot(that was only way to keep him\nalive).<br><br>In my opinion the film is gripping and moving in some parts.The special\neffects are spectacular,but the best thing about film is story.The\nacting is good, but not as good as story.I reckon the film is\nsuccessful.I recommend the film for all lovers of action films.\n"},
{"review": "\nIs the reviewer writing the review the IMDb member is reading -- or is\nthe member reading the review he was looking for, regardless of the\ntext actually used? I ask because clearly that sort of thinking, that\nsort of dialog, was near and dear to the writer of this oddball film,\nyet, paradoxically, it is this very strangeness that gives the film\nhistorical worth, and the chance (however slim) that it may be\nremembered fondly by viewers of the the far future.<br><br>We will skip the metaphysical question as to why a remake was done of a\nperfectly serviceable and timeless classic? What the original may have\nhave lacked in CGI, it made up for in heart, and in its almost unique\nsatirical POV on modern corporation communications (which led to a\nseries spin off on Canadian TV, BTW) But Hollywood likes reimagining\nstuff. Even Vincent Price as THE FLY was reborn as the forever\nself-aware Jeff Goldbloom, and we sense this was what was intended here\ntoo.<br><br>Reviewers notes: 1. Strange casting. A-List supporting cast (including\nthe under-used Jackie Earle Haley) yet the lead himself seems\nuncomfortable in the role.<br><br>2. The references to Wizard of Oz are doubly ironic since the movie\nitself suffers as much of an identity crisis as the main character.\nSince this is clearly no longer an action film with embedded satire\n(the \"origins\" go for a full hour!) then what is it? Sci-fi? Horror?\nFantasy? The viewer is left to decide.<br><br>Bottom line: not entertainment as we know it. More of a film school\nessay topic, along the lines of what was intended ... and why was this\ngreenlighted?\n"},
{"review": "\nI had high hopes for this film but was left under nourished and simply\nfelt a bit \"meh\" after watching it. As expected the special FX/cgi were\nimpressive and generally a viewable reboot of Robocop but without the\ngenius of Paul Verhoeven at the helm all the humour, social digs and\ngeneral \"this is friggin cool\" was totally lacking and it ended up\nbeing just another sci-fi film that will fade into the \"oh yeah I saw\nthat...once\" category. I loved the first two movies (3 sucked) and, as\nI said earlier, had high hopes.<br><br>I can only say watch it if you have never seen the original - but if\nyou have you may not want to taint your mind with this reboot in the\nattempt to relive past glories of the Robocop ethos.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is the quintessential shoot 'em up of the modern age with a\nhefty dose of stealthy reverse-moralizing. Strong right-wing 'news'\nstyle pathos and false intellectualism is interspersed with patriotic\nfervor in the news segments given by Novak (Samuel L. Jackson). This is\nthat reverse-moralizing I was talking about - a carefully crafted anti-\ndrone movie. This movie is the \"logical\" extension of the use of\nwarfare drones abroad making it onto the streets of America. The case\nmade against corporate corruption and graft, interwoven with\nineffectual or pocket politicians, is strong here. But if you're just\nlooking for a shoot 'em up - this should work well for you. And if that\nisn't enough, at the very end we get to watch Samuel L. Jackson\nscreaming bleeped out obscenities at the camera. All in all, the\nperfect end to a movie like this. :)\n"},
{"review": "\nAs a remake, and given modern CG's, I thought this film was going to be\nan extravaganza of the programmers skills, IE, Avengers, X-men etc. No,\nthis film is a let down in that department. There are great moments of\ngraphic wizardry, but not enough to make this film as good as it could\nhave been. <br><br>The actors do there best with a mediocre script, and the premise is a\nrehash, (though slightly reworked) of the 80's blockbuster. In the 80's\nthe idea was new, and made great viewing, but this 'copy' is a let\ndown. The lead is played by a relative unknown, who doesn't really act\nwell, or inspire me to either; check out his previous films, or look\nforward to the future ones. I enjoyed watching Samuel L Jackson and\nGary Goldman, as they lifted this film, but their great acting wasn't\nenough to make this film anything more than a poor remake.\n"},
{"review": "\nI remember very vividly going to see the 1987 original starring Peter\nWeller, directed by Paul Verhoeven. Like Verhoeven's other films, such\nas \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Total Recall\", the orig. \"RoboCop\" had a very\nmenacing feel to it- but in the best possible way!- just sorta hits you\nover the head and says - LOOK AT THIS AWESOME STUFF!! LOL<br><br>With this 2014 remake, I'll actually have to say I think this version\nis even a little better than the original- goes into more the\nscientific end of things, as well as the corporate involvement in an\nenterprise such as this- incorporating drones, human choice, etc... I\nreally liked this movie, especially for the performances by Gary Oldman\nand recent Oscar nominee Michael Keaton (damn!- I really wished he had\nwon for \"Birdman\"! :( ). <br><br>Okay, my only one drawback with the remake is it's lead actor, a\nrelatively unknown Swede named Joel Kinnaman (\"The Killing\" &amp; the just\nreleased Liam Neeson thriller \"Run All Night\"). He's not a bad actor by\nany means- adequate in the role. My issue isn't with his casting, but\nthe mere casting of an unknown. I honestly think with a role like\nRoboCop you need a somewhat known presence, like Peter Weller was in\nthe first film- not a household name by any means when that film came\nout, but had been a rising star in films like \"Firstborn\" by then. You\nneed someone who has a personality that can transcend the suit- look at\nRobert Downey Jr. in \"Iron Man\"--perfect example.<br><br>But other than that, I'll definitely give this remake a recommend,\nwhether you've seen the '87 original or not--overall a slick, well-made\nsci-fi action/thriller.\n"},
{"review": "\nWell, the overall graphics was very awesome but there were a lot of\nflaws. First, it would have been good if the robocop has some\ncatchphrases or a good sense of humour. Secondly,the robocop was not\nseen taking down bad guys and showing how awesome he really is.\nThirdly, there was no actual bad guy that could match him, no real\nvillain. Fourthly, by the time, the robocop had hit the streets, more\nthen half the movie was already gone and the robocop just had a dull\nenvironment surrounding him. The makers could have done better but\nhowever the movie still gets a six because there was some cool action.\nThe robocop movie is still a good ones but don't keep your hopes up.\ncompared to some other summer movies, they are still above them.\n"},
{"review": "\nLet's get this out of the way: I expect to be thoroughly entertained,\nin one way or another, by every film I see. Unless it directly states\nan ulterior motive at the onset, I want to be moved on my way out of\nthe theater or after ejecting the DVD in a way I wasn't before I\nwatched the film.<br><br>Now, in regards to RoboCop, I expected to at least be as happy with the\nresults as I was with the first two, Peter Weller installations. The\ntrailers for this film made this look unlikely, but I wasn't going to\nbe deterred. I'm glad I wasn't.<br><br>This film is far from bad. But it is disappointing. With a strong cast\n(and one of Gary Oldman's best roles in recent memory), more might have\nbeen done. That would have necessitated some fleshing out of the\nscript, more intensive relationships between Murphy and those close to\nhim, etc. As it ended up, I enjoyed myself, but was left wanting\nsomething else. A weird combination, but an all too common one with\nmajor Hollywood productions.<br><br>Those who saw and enjoyed the WellerCop films, you'll enjoy this. You\nmight end up wanting more, as I did, but enjoy it you will. You already\nknow the bar wasn't set terribly high to begin with. Those who are\nvirgins to the franchise, start from the beginning and then compare and\ncontrast the old and the new. You don't want to start here.

{"review": "\nNot only is this movie sexist and extremely racist. It goes out of its\nway to establish the idea that United States is the best country the\nworld will ever see.

{"review": "\nNo, please don't ask me where I would cut it. A first-class production\nthat makes Paul Verhoeven's 1987 version and all the sequels look like\ncheap claptrap.

Just a face, brain and a really big\npair of lungs. Kind of like an \"Iron Man\" feel to it! Again, The\nRobocop steals the show, showing far more humanity than his demented\nboss (Michael Keaton) and his \"red-team trainer\". Samuel L.

The \"Tin Man\" costume is entirely \"matted in\"! This\nversion has a morality to it: You can't take the humanity out of the\nman, as hard as you try. Nature will find a way. Garry Oldman plays\nbrilliant scientist Dennett Norton, and as usual, he's terrific. The\nsupporting cast (relatively unknown Canadians) is quite competent. The\nspecial effects start out great, but the mechanical \"Robocops\" look\nlike men in rubber suits at the climax, which I suspect they are. (Way\nover budget?)
