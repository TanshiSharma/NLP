{"review": "\nThe title \"Focus\" had potential among the quantitatively declining Con-\nArtist genre. Although brilliantly centered and set up with a decent\ncast and setting - the execution of intelligent criminal activity was\npoor and often justifying or explaining trickery and illusion as \"he's\njust so good at it.\" - failing to satisfy the audience with an insight\ninto the brilliance that is a con-centered plan. <br><br>I love heist movies. I love intricate con movies. I love crime movies\nand I'm sad to say this doesn't really come close to fitting anywhere\nbetween those genres best and brightest. Instead you're left feeling\nslightly amused, slightly tired, slightly relieved that it's over but\nkind of happy you saw it anyway - I dread to think how badly this movie\nwould have been were it not for will smith.\n"},

{"review": "\nFocus is a con movie and it's at its best when it's trying to con you\ninto believing you know what is going to happen.

During the second half of the movie the\nplot deepens and works around character development. That's when Will\nSmith and Margot Robbie come to life, they are at their best when they\nare given more to work with and they keep the movie interesting.\nHowever the movie gets caught juggling too many cons which by the end\nof the movie may feel just a bit flat; but still make for an unexpected\nand enjoyable finale. <br><br>Definitely worth watching.

Next he sees\nher during a job, she rejects him, he is chasing her, without any\nexplanation, suddenly Nicky is madly in love with her and there was no\nindication of that whatsoever.Also Nickey completely forgets about a\nbig job he is supposed to do. And that only makes sense because he is\nnot good at 'expressing his feelings'. In the end, they are together\nand in love and have forgiven each other everything. Really confusing.\nI found myself forwarding trough some scenes after that first 40min. I\nusually watch every minute of every film i start , even bad ones but\nnot this one.

In general, 'Focus' was so boring that it encouraged the\nconjugation of obscure Latin verbs, and recalling second cousins. Half\nthe audience left after Will's fifth wander about his hotel room in\nsearch of a shirt. I stayed until the bitter end, feeling bitter about\nthe cost in time and money associated with a movie that sails between\ntedium and apathy to steal a line from 'Mr. Roberts'.

{"review": "\nAny movie with BD Wong or Rodrigo Santoro is always worth watching. The\nmovie Focus has BOTH Wong AND Santoro, which makes it even more\nirresistible. And as a bonus, the leads are played by Will Smith and\nMargot Robbie, who also deliver engaging performances although their\ntalents are wasted here. The two Oscar nominees are not challenged to\nact other than simply be charming. The writing is sharp and sexy,\nalthough the story is clearly a far-fetched one. This flick is meant to\nbe mere entertainment, so don't bother wracking your mind trying to\nmake too much sense of the plotting.

OK, might you be\ngay, or female, then Smith without shirt would make you happy. However\nI expect more when something costs 50 million, not a picture of a guy\nwith a trained upper body. I am going to say it: I expect a good story,\nand good actors.

And there is a jaw-dropping sequence\nin the middle of the movie at the Super Bowl with a brilliant payoff.\nThat is why the ending of this picture was a bit disappointing with\ndouble crosses just piling up.<br><br>Overall, \"Focus\" is a great movie escapism. It has uniformly good\nperformances, very intriguing and smart script and just big fun to\nwatch it.\n"},
{"review": "\nSo this movie left me breathless. In the moment you think that it is\nabout to become like the average and prospective American movie, you\nget fooled. This movie reminds me of Gone girl - the same tricky story\nwith criminals, women, men, love.. except here - it is even more\ninteresting - cars, money, business. This movie shows a great view from\nthieves eyesight, I think that most of us wouldn't have imagined how\nstealing worked or how it could work. In conclusion, I suggest this\nmovie to everyone who likes brain teasers and maybe magic. Although the\nname of the movie is FOCUS, you should keep focused too. It is like a\nmessage before watching it... which I didn't notice.\n"},
{"review": "\n'Focus' ticks all the boxes you'd expect from a Will Smith movie. He's\nslick. He's charming, He's a wise-ass with a whole box of tricks up his\nsleeve. So far so not-so-Fresh Prince. What makes 'Focus' interesting\nis the screen dynamic with Margot Robbie. There's a chemistry there,\nwhich may prove interesting in their next screen combo \u0096 as Deadshot\nand Harley Quinn in the film of DC's 'Suicide Squad'. The plot itself\nis a greatest hits of con-men and caper flicks, with double-cross and\ndeception so layered that the audience is so sure, twenty minutes into\nthe affair, that there is no point in trying to fathom who's scamming\nwho...some of the inevitable twists are telegraphed with astonishing\nunsubtlety, others subject to double, triple or quadruple bluffs. What\nmakes this clich\u00e9-ridden nonsense genuinely entertaining is \u0096 as\nalready noted \u0096 the partnership of Smith and Robbie. They ain't no\nTracy and Hepburn, but their sparring is worth the ticket price.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film tells the story of a con man who is able to pull almost any\ntrick to earn millions in minutes. He seemingly falls for a woman who\nlearns the trade from him, but nothing is as it seems.<br><br>\"Focus\" certainly keeps me focused for the entire film! The plot twists\nand turns, and there is a constant switch between who is the conman and\nwho is being conned. It makes the story fun. The bets in the American\nfootball stadium is a bit far fetched, but it certainly makes the story\nmore exciting. Margot Robbie plays the seemingly innocent con novice\nwell, and she's attractive too. The ending is unexpected, which is\ngood, but I'm irritated by the fact that the guy walked away without\nany objections being voiced. Surely there's another trick behind it?\n"},
{"review": "\nWill Smith stars in a fantastic, twist taking saga that will leave you\nthrilled as much as confused. I reckon Old Willy had a bit to do with\nthe movie more than just his acting, as seen in his bed romp early in\nthe movie, so early it was the second scene. Get that into ya kiddies!\nI didn't mind much as the female is quite striking. If the movies\nanything like the first five minutes, this could be entertaining I\nthought. Ultimately, however ole Wills role as the liar come truthy\ncome liar and that birds role as the truthy come liar come truthycome\nliar ultimately left me confused. In the end while entertaining I\ncouldn't help but feel someone (my housemate) had played me in perhaps\nthe biggest play of the evening, even on a Tuesday. 2.5 stars\n"},
{"review": "\nHere's a con caper that is easy to watch. Don't expect \"The Sting\" and\nyou won't be disappointed.<br><br>Ignore holes you could drive a race car through and sit back and go for\nthe ride. It has some good twists and some things you see coming a mile\naway. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between the leads. <br><br>Nice blend of comedy and drama. Good use of music.. The language and\nsome not at all funny violence gives this an R rating. While the\ninternational aspects of the movie seemed real, the use of fake\nfootball teams in the \"Big Game\" detracted from the realism.<br><br>The movie looks good on the big screen but not much will be lost on a\nhome platform.\n"},
{"review": "\n'FOCUS' reminds me of 'Now You See Me' because both depend on a sleight\nof hand to distract people from the true goal of their con. Even the\ndeception trick in 'Focus' derives from 'Now You See Me'. And as long\nas the former focuses on tricks, it acquits itself admirably in\nentertaining people.<br><br>However, once it delves into the realm of romance between Will Smith\nand Margot Robbie, things go awry.

{"review": "\nCon film with Will Smith teaching fresh young face Robbie the con ropes\nand then letting her work with the rest of his crew in N'Orleans. I got\nconfused and somehow thought from the trailers I had seen that Samuel\nJackson gets involved as a bad guy, but that was Kingsmen and this\ndoesn't go in that direction. To talk more about the plot would\nconstitute a spoiler so let's just say that Smith is excellent, Robbie\ndoes a nice acting job although her looks are a tad too model-ly for\nme, Martinez does another solid side role as in Secret Life, and it was\nnice to see McRaney again. The movie benefits from the input of ace\nillusionist Apollo Robbins of Brain Games fame. The cinematography is\ngrand and the story keeps you involved until the end - a good not great\nmovie.\n"},
{"review": "\nFocus is full of twists and turns but despite this the film manages to\nstay fairly clear. A movie about con artists is bound to fool you a\nlittle bit and its not riddled with clich\u00e9s. Will Smith is back and as\ngood as ever. I really think this guy like doesn't age. This movie a\nlittle bit more vulgar than you expect from him because he generally\ndoes films that can be enjoyed by teens and adults. This movie is more\nof an adult film and you hear a lot of cursing form Smith which is a\nrarity. Margot Robbie is also a great accomplice for Smith and the two\nhave great chemistry. They create some humorous moments together. Focus\nblends many genres of film into one great movie. I'd skip fifty shades\nand watch Focus if I were you.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt had a few very smart scenes, like the ones that showed what con\nartists do and the scene in the fancy box seats at a football game.\nNicely done. In a way it seemed to surround great scenes with \"some\nother stuff\" but the great scenes and humor kept me from being sorry I\nshowed up. There is a major plot twist at the end, and it was\ninteresting, just not fully fleshed out; and see what you think but I\nthink it contained an error. Will was enjoyable, very easy-breezy (not\nsilly) and cool and funny. He and Margot had excellent chemistry. It\ncan get tricky when the couple is mixed race if the actors themselves\nappear cautious or nervous about how it will be received. But these two\nwere just a couple in love. I liked that. I really enjoyed Gerald\nMcRaney too. I always wanted more from him and couldn't wait for him to\nshow up again. It wasn't great, but it felt fresh.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's not my intention to watch this movie. I just being forced coz I'm\nnot the type of person who is into action and stuff. I thought it was a\nwaste of money but I was wrong.<br><br>The story focuses on Will Smith's character being a con-man with his\nwork partner played by Margot Robbie. They separated for years and\naccidentally meet each other together with their own agenda.<br><br>I rate it 90% due to it funny humor and great acting. Margot Robbie is\na piece of perfection from land down under. She is natural and sexy!.\nAnd about the story, the flow was great with no dead scenes at all.\nWell, maybe just 10% of the movie but it was freaking entertaining.<br><br>Must Watch!\n"},
{"review": "\nWatching this movie had me on the edge of my seat threw out the whole\nfilm. The way Will Smith executed the role of Nicky had me scratching\nmy head thinking \"Why wasn't he in the oceans eleven movies.\" He did a\ngreat job and don't let me discredit the supporting roles. All around a\ngreat movie from beginning to end. Definitely one of my favorite films\nfrom will Smith. It's also great to see Margot Robbie in a lead role,\nnot only is she drop dead gorgeous but she can hold her own in a movie\nlike this. Really didn't know what to expect walking into the theater\nto see it. But I definitely don't regret spending the money. I really\nlook forward to see what Will Smith's next movie is going to be like.\nIt's a Must watch film, and perfect for a date night. Two thumbs way\nup!!\n"},
{"review": "\nWatching \"Focus\" is just one of those movies that will entertain with\nthrills it has fantasy and adventure of getting away with scores of\nmoney and guilty pleasures of luck it's like a dream for anyone! Will\nSmith is Nicky a con man who travels and comes away with money and\ndiamonds only his game is changed when a flame enters the game a hot\nsexy lady named Jess(in a sexy performance from Margot Robbie). Thru\nthe film it's a cat and mouse game the two play on travel trips as they\nhustle the goods and merchandise from the bad people all while having\nfun and passion and it was nice seeing Margot in that sexy black bra!\nAnd she even has a damsel in distress scene by getting tied up and\nhaving her mouth duct taped! Overall good little tease movie to see of\nfun and dreams a showcase for the up and coming sexy Margot Robbie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm thrilled to see its success and there's good credit about the main\ntwo actors on the film.Will Smith is a guy who will bring much\nattention in terms of appearing funny and charming to the most audience\nso rather enjoy the movie by focusing on how it starts right up to the\nend.Margot Robbie on the other side is a new chick in the flick but has\nattractive talent and I wish I had a girl like her but not all that\nbrings attention it's all about how she puts out the female superiority\namongst lustful men who can't seem to find what she's all about\nalthough Will on the other hand is the one getting caught to be beaten\nup on his master-plans.Good movies like these don't wear-off like blue\njeans in a bucket full of washing powder and water.\n"},
{"review": "\nAfter carrying off a number of successful scams (during which period\nthey also enjoyed a fling), scam empire boss Nicky abandons pickpocket\nhottie Jess. Three years later, their paths cross again. But who is\nscamming who this time? <br><br>I'm sure that if I think too hard about this glossy offering, which has\nstrong elements of both caper movie and romantic comedy in it, it may\nwell crumble to dust. So I'm not going to, because I greatly enjoyed\nit. All the scamming is nicely done, and highly entertaining (albeit\nmorally questionable), and the plotting and romance keeps you guessing\nall the way through. <br><br>Will Smith, as Nicky, is reliable, and Margot Robbie, as Jess, is\nfunny, sexy, and believable. I thought she was good in Wolf Of Wall\nStreet: she is better here. She is already the go-to girl for high\nprofile glamour leading lady work, and I suspect that she will show\ngreater versatility as time goes on.<br><br>Recommended.\n"},
{"review": "\nBased on the trailers for this movie I did not know what to think of\nthis. But after I saw it last night, this exceeded my expectations.\nThis was a stylish, different and a very creative kind of movie. It\ntakes us into the world of con artists and the creative ways they get\naway with crime. This was very entertaining the whole way through and\nhas a cast of very colorful characters. The character of Farhad had me\nlaughing at every scene he was in and the stunningly beautiful Margot\nRobbie gave an excellent performance as she usually does. And of\ncourse, the King of Cool, Will Smith is slick and charming as ever.\nThis is an excellent comeback after the disasters that were After Earth\nand Winter's Tale. So in all this was a very good film and you should\ndefinitely check it out.\n"},
{"review": "\nAfter enduring Will Smiths last outing with the appalling \"After Earth\"\nI must admit I was hesitant to watch this however it definitely proved\nme wrong and was a great film to watch. Will was back to his best and\nthe film was exciting, funny and contained an intriguing plot. Also\nMargot Robbie is proving to be a revelation and excelled again after\nher great performance in \"Wolf of Wall Street\". The chemistry between\nthe two is evident which only improves the film whilst also\nsimultaneously making me excited for the next collaboration between the\ntwo in \"Suicide Squad\". Whilst it might not be the best film of the\nyear, it certainly holds it own compared to some of the films playing\nat the moment. The nature of this is film boils down to the simple fact\nthat you come to watch a movie to be entertained and this film delivers\nso I definitely recommend it.<br><br>Nice to have you back Will :)<br><br>8/10\n"},
{"review": "\nThis was an awesome movie; the chemistry between the actors was\ninevitable! Honestly after watching fifty shades of gray, this movie\nwas a breath of fresh air! It was sexy and the storyline had flow! I\nthink this will be my number one movie this year! The characters had a\nlot of chemistry it was HOT! The storyline was very interesting and the\nwhole movie had a message at the end! I would definitely watch it again\nin the cinema that is for sure. It did remain me of the movie HITCH,\nbut with a much better storyline and much more action! I absolutely\nlove how Will Smith just looks better with age and be still got it!\nWorth every penny.\n"},
{"review": "\namazing movie, could be one of the most brilliant with new idea &amp;\ncontent. perfection is what it is. i actually liked how everything was\nmixed so that the viewer will get confused, at some point you will say\nhow stupid he was about what he was doing or thinking , but explaining\nit later it actually means pure evil. the combination of drama, comedy\n&amp; action is what made it a great movie to watch &amp; never to blink so\nthat you wont miss a shot. great outfits, cars, jewelries &amp; decorations\nadded a great touch &amp; sharpness. the idea itself of making a lot of\nmoney in no time &amp; that easy even so its somehow impossible , but it\ngive you some relief that someday you can too just DO IT !!!\n"},
{"review": "\nDon't let these narcissistic people influence your decision to go watch\nthis movie. This was a great, thrilling movie that keeps you interested\nand entailed till the very end. These \"experts\" try to divulge into\nthis movie so bad trying to nitpick at every crack, that they simply\nforgot the ability to actually \"get into\" a movie. To be with the movie\nwith every scene occurring- occurs within you. This is not a sensation\nlike one from interstellar, (which is definitely in my top movies) but\nthe feeling I get from this is more similar to my feeling with \"Rush.\"\nCompletely different movies- yes, but this movie has the same feeling\nof ecstasy and will *figuratively* be sending you through twists and\nturns. It was a very pleasant watch, and if it wasn't for all these\nidiotic reviews my honest review would probably be a very strong 7-\nmediocre 8. See this one for yourself and you'll be walking out of the\ntheater satisfied shaking your head and balking at how someone could\npossibly give this movie a 2- a 5- a 3. Just a disservice.\n"}
