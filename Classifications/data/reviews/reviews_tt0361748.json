{"review": "\nI will just start with some quotes from other reviewers that describes\nit the best.<br><br>\"This is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and\nprobably the worst film Tarantino has ever done.\" \"The ONLY good thing\nin this movie was the performance of Mr. Waltz\".<br><br>\"So I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of\nthe greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that\nleaves me with my mouth opened\" Now for more details go and read \"Hated\nit\" reviews.<br><br>One thing I hate about a movie is when it treats audience as bunch of\ndumb people. (Spoiler ahead). Now I know Tarantino's style is based on\nfantasy and fictitious plots, but come on, Adolf Hitler and 200 top\nNazis Officers will be in attendance of a movie premier in occupied\nFrance and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the\nsurroundings? Where also an American-African walks around freely with\nsteel pipes locking doors and setting fire. These 2 guards are then\nexecuted in seconds opening the door for our 2 \"heroes\" to slay Hitler\nat point blank with around 100 rounds... very dumb. At least, challenge\nour intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most\nfeared tyrants of all time (Go watch Valkyrie). Besides, Mike Myers\nimpersonation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than\nthe guy doing Hitler, just picture that.<br><br>What ruined it further, is that the only smart and powerful character,\nwhich nailed everyone in the movie, with his psychological and mind\nbending interrogations, ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most\nmindless character in the movie.<br><br>After watching the movie, I was sympathizing with Nazis, who were\nportrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our Basterds!!!\nImagine that.<br><br>My recommendations, if you have insomnia, 2hrs 33 min to waste or you\nwant to give your mind a break, go watch this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br><br>What is the purpose of this movie? A bunch of Americans enters\nNazi-occupied France and starts slaughtering Germans. You see them\nscalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats.\nWhile making jokes, of course.<br><br>Some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a\nparody, it is neither witty nor funny. The contents is zero. It is\nexceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political\nmessage, because it is again \"the good guys\" killing \"bad Nazis\". The\nwhole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Could you imagine a\nstoryline where Nazis (while making jokes) kill everybody in the Warsaw\nghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is exactly\nabout that, with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral\nexpectations of a certain audience: slaughtering people is so cool when\ndone by the right people.<br><br>This movie only works because of the hidden Nazi-ideology underneath.\nIt does not regard the enemy as people. And if the latter is supposed\nto be an element of the fun, I am happy to say that this kind of fun\nwill always remain a mystery to me.<br><br>Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the American crowd\nwhile a bit of nudity will freak them out. But if a naked body is\npornography, this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at\nits very worst.<br><br>Inglorious Basterds is a pointless, boring and tasteless waste of time\nand money.\n"},

It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly \r\nisn't interfeared with by the powers that be.

It's not for everyone, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but \r\nnever-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self \r\nrespecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph \r\nWaltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!\n"},

The entire point of a film is\nto entertain - if u call bashing people's heads and removing their\nscalps entertaining!!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie\ncan commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust.<br><br>The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and\ndisgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages.\nThere is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at\nthe same table, before, thankfully they are all shot.

{"review": "\nFor those that have studied WWII, and unfortunately, seen real human\nbrains on the ground, this movie is a travesty, a sadistic farce, and a\ncomplete waste of time like most of Tarantino's other questionable\nwork.

However, this\nthing does not even have an original title.<br><br>I (unfortunately) received this DVD by mistake and see this project as\na new low for Brad Pitt and the other actors taking part in this joke\nof making jews more barbaric than the Nazis. It perpetuates blame on\nthe common German soldiers while covering up the major part US and UK\nbankers like Prescott Bush had in funding Hitler, as well as, the now\nconfirmed part that British Intelligence had in bringing Hitler and\nMussolini to power beginning immediately at the end of WWI.<br><br>WWII was a complex and tragic event, and the real world history\ndeserves better than this self serving, mythological blood feast served\nup for fools too lazy to look for the truth and try to prevent a\nrecurrence. History can repeat itself when we become manipulated by\npropaganda, desensitized to inhumane actions, and self righteous.<br><br>If you want to look at atrocities, many can argue that Stalin made\nHitler and the Nazis look like rank amateurs in the business of\nmurdering innocent people, as well as, the drug crazed gangs of Niger\nroping off streets with human intestines. Where does it end? We need to\nbe getting the multitude of shadowy intelligence agencies under control\nand accountability instead of getting a cheap emotional thrill about\nperpetuating their myths in Hollywood and our capitol cities.\n"},

We, along with a lot of the other people in the\naudience walked out of the theater muttering \"that was disgusting\",\n\"what a waste of time\", \"I should've walked out\", \"where was the\ncomedy\", \"that was pathetic\", etc. It actually made us, the audience,\nvoice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly\nripped off.

{"review": "\nReviews of this film are largely split into 2 camps; it's good because,\nor it's bad despite, it's direction by Tarantino.<br><br>The question I asked myself after this was would this have been made\nwithout the Pitt/ Tarantino stamp? The answer was no; and the result\nwas a film that made me so irate that I was moved to post my first\nreview on IMDb...<br><br>I found everything about this film treated the film goer with something\napproaching contempt. The script was thin with the exception of one\nwell written character - Landa. Scripting for other characters was\nanodyne or non-existent, or, in the case of the \"Jew-Bear\", simply a\nbit weird. Same for the other aspects of characterisation, that was\nformulaic and thin in nearly every case, especially the made-for-Pitt\nAldo Raine and the other Basterds. Style pastiching that normally works\ndidn't; subject matter was treated with either insufficient levity or\nindifference; scenes were badly edited or irrelevant. The redeeming\naspects were cinematography and production values - style over content.<br><br>So - am I taking it too seriously? No; this is not a funny film (though\noccasionally it seems to try) and the violence that is shown sits\nuneasily between cartoonish and unnecessary - a prime example is that\nof the surrendered German who was beaten to death; added nothing, in\nany way. In fact the tone of the film was so inconsistent in the way it\nconsidered the material that it made me very uneasy.<br><br>For me - Tarantino needs to start making films to impress others, not\njust himself. Obviously (most of) the rest of the world disagrees, but\nthat's something either Mr T or I will have to learn to live with...<br><br>One of the most disappointing films I've seen.\n"},

But here are some messages I get\nof this movie:<br><br>1) The Nazis were honorable man who rather die then betraying their\ncountry.<br><br>2) America formed a group of blood thirsty Jews to wipe out the Nazi\noccupation. Actually they are not only blood thirsty but also mentally\ndeficient. (just consider how the Bear Jew behaves after killing the\nGerman officer with a bat).<br><br>3) It was an easy job to assassinate Hitler, who had only 2 guards in\nthe whole city while he was attending a movie in occupied France. The\nother high ranked German officers didn't even consider the need for\nguards.<br><br>I was also disappointed at the and when the only powerful and well\nportrayed character in the movie (Colonel Landa) turned so easily\nagainst his country. He was even enjoying the situation which was in\ncontrast with his character.<br><br>Well, you may say that this movie is the result of QT's superior\nimagination and I could only say \"good job dude...\"\n"},
{"review": "\nTarantino continues to make idiotic cartoons that at best glorify and\nat worst encourage violence. Next time there's a mass shooting\nsomewhere, consider whether movies like this one have made violence\nfashionable, dramatic, cool, newsworthy, glorious or even a little less\nthan totally unacceptable.<br><br>Suspension of disbelief can't possibly include fantasizing that the\nNazis would be stupid enough to send all four of its top leaders into a\ntiny Jewish-run cinema in Paris. Comic book authors usually won't\ninsult their readers to that extent. On the contrary, they tend to\nwrite with a level of logic and intelligence far above Tarantino.<br><br>Production, acting, music, cinematography in the film are very good,\nbut they can't counteract the insipid premise, plot, and overall\nconcept. Speaking of music, the borrowed Morricone pieces are very\ngood, but the rock, r&amp;b, etc., are totally out of place and tear down\nthe facade of a period piece.<br><br>Similarly, Christoph Waltz as SS detective Hans Landa gave an amazing\nperformance which was ruined by psychotic leaps out of character as\nwritten by Tarantino. Yes it showed Waltz's amazing acting range, but\nit also destroyed the integrity of his character.<br><br>There are numerous \"artistic\" continuity errors in the film, no doubt\ncreated to give a cleaner looking shot. When Landa strangles von\nHammersmark, both of their chairs mysteriously disappear. When Raine\ncarves Landa's forehead, Landa's handcuffs disappear so he can grasp at\nthe grass in pain, etc. Again this reinforces the notion that these are\ncomics, and rather bad ones at that.\n"},

{"review": "\n\"Inglourious Basterds\" is supposed to be Quentin Tarantino's homage to\nthe Spaghetti Western. And here's what is interesting: Tarantino has\nhad 40 years to improve on Sergio Leone's 1960s masterpieces. And he's\nfailed miserably.<br><br>\"Basterds\" is a rambling, incoherent mess of a movie. It's obvious that\nTarantino desperately wants to be the ultimate \"bad boy\" of cinema who\nmakes \"controversial\" films. But if Tarantino really wanted to be\ncontroversial in making a war film, he'd tackle the horrors of the Iraq\nWar, instead of World War II, a long-ago war that already has been\nre-hashed over and over from every conceivable angle over the decades.<br><br>Tarantino deeply wants to shock us, to outrage us and to create\ndisturbing art. And he fails miserably. The fact is, Leone was\ninfinitely more daring and controversial way back in 1968 than\nTarantino ever has been. When Leone depicted the vicious cold-blooded\ngunning down of a child in \"Once Upon a Time in the West,\" he created a\nscene that Tarantino would never, ever have the courage to film.\nCompared to scenes like that, everything in \"Basterds\" is tame and\npredictable (as is the case with all of Tarantino's work).<br><br>Last, but not least, I really can't understand why anyone would be\ninterested in Tarantino's take on the 1960s Spaghetti Western film\ngenre.

The Basterds storyline is by far\nthe weakest. We are treated to a short speech about the Nazi killers, a\nfew few short scenes and montages and then the final massacre at the\ntheater. I feel that Tarantino would have been better off leaving them\nas shadowy figures in the background, as a real band of vengeful and\nsilent assassins, instead of making them appear as unlikable cretins.\nGive them less screen time, but make it count. <br><br>The Shosanna storyline is as thin, but at least Laurent's character's\nback story is given to the viewer (in parts, at least). The love story\nwith Marcel also felt tacked on at all moments. <br><br>What is even sadder is that the movie started out great. The farm scene\nis up there with Tarantino's best offerings. Much of that praise can be\nattributed to Waltz's performance as Lauda which is simply stunning and\nfrightening. Too bad the movie started going downhill afterward, what\nwith wooden 40 minutes dialogs (nothing new for Tarantino there, but at\nleast the long conversations used to be funny or clever) and\nsuperfluous/masturbatory references that only served to remind the\nviewer that he was watching a QT flick.<br><br>Still, the movie merits a viewing if only for Col. Lauda, but it\ncertainly won't become a classic.\n"},

That is the first instance.

What is so great about a bunch of American\nJews, hellbent on violent revenge, who go into occupied France to kill\n(murder) as many Germans as possible? And the idea that the entire Nazi\nleadership, including Hitler, would gather to a cinema in Paris to\nwatch the premiere of a new Nazi movie, is so stupid and implausible\nthat it's not even funny. At least Tarantino's previous films, though\nas insanely violent as this one, did have good story lines and were\ncredible. This one is straight from the mind of an inmate of some\nlunatic asylum.

{"review": "\nEverything is forgiven because \"Inglorious Basterds\" is so entertaining\nand at the end of the day that'\u00ecs what matters. I think it's a pity\nthat certain critics, specially in Italy, are determined to transform\nthis clever pulp director into some kind of god. Maybe, partly, because\nTarantino has been very clever, elevating some of the Italian pulp\nmovies of the 60's and 70's to a sort of cult status. Italy is very\ngrateful for that, he's rewarded with interminable praise. I fear\nthat's the wrong approach, it's also confusing. He makes popcorn\nmovies, brilliantly. The characters have never anything important to\nsay, Burger King, Superman, that's the extent of its depth and I think\nhe's tapping into a society that's getting shallower and shallower with\nevery passing year. But, if I'm mentioning this instead of talking\nabout all the great things I could be saying about his movie is because\nthere is a strange force trying to brain wash me into believing that\nTarantino is the most important influence in movies since time\nimmemorial. No, he's a great director of inconsequential fun movies. I\nconsider myself a fan and I intend to see all his future movies. This\none has some wonderful touches, winking at other movies by John\nSturges, Robert Aldrich etc. Brad Pitt and in particular Christoph\nWaltz give wonderful performances.

Great little moments \"inspired\" by\nother movies. \"The Guns Of Navarone\", \"Operation Crossbow\" and a myriad\nof 70's B exploitation Italian movies.

I can't help but remember\nErnst Lubitch's \"To Be Or Not To Be\" that was also a comedy with\nremarkable, inventive dialog but it also had so many other layers that\n\"To Be Or Not To Be\" after 70 years still resonates with whoever has\nseen it.

{"review": "\nAs a fan of Tarantino's 90s gangster flicks, especially Pulp Fiction, I\nreally wanted to like his latest offering. I wasn't all that impressed\nby Kill Bill, so was hoping this would be a return to form. Sadly, it\ndidn't quite do it for me. The story is an interesting one: a team of\nJewish American soldiers are sent to Vichy France to hunt down Nazis.\nThere were a few entertaining set-piece action scenes and the odd bit\nof snappy dialogue. Overall, though, the film seemed to drag on at an\nachingly-slow pace. I could see that Tarantino was trying to build some\ntension etc, and the opening scene where a Nazi interrogator spends\nsome time in inane banter with a man harbouring Jewish refugees was\nreally well-played. The nerves increased as I wondered whether he would\nfind the Jews hiding under the floorboards and there was some decent\nsuspense. What undid the film, though, was that such scenes were more\nor less replayed several times over. I felt that Tarantino was too\nconcerned with paying homage to various things/people/music, rather\nthan directing a tightly-scripted film. This could have been really\npunchy at about 90 minutes, but it rambled on for over 2 and a half\nhours. The finale was pretty good and made up for that somewhat, but\nwhen it was over I just felt a bit empty: this could have been so much\nbetter. I don't think Tarantino will be able to match his earlier\nachievements and I probably shouldn't compare films which are\nadmittedly different. Yet I couldn't help feeling disappointed that\nthis latest Tarantino movie wasn't on the same level as Reservoir Dogs:\nwe know he is capable of greatness, but maybe he's got nothing left in\nthe tank...\n"},
