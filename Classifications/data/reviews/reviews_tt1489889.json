{"review": "\nForget about the formulaic spies plot and its flaws, the film does not\nlook silly for the wise decision of making it into a comedy and it\nsparks thanks to the strong rapport between Johnson and Hart. The\nthriller may seems to be dumb and lack of inventiveness in all the\nright ways but it is also a bit smarter than what audiences could have\nexpected. The hilarious but not nonsense actions, sweet high- school\nbuddies friendships, comedy about bullies and inspiration to transform\na better oneself however are all blended well into this\nlack-of-originality thriller; though insufficient to generate big\nhumors, it is still able to keep your smile till the end. The film\ncentralises on the delightful chemistry between the two actors, both\nHart and Johnson deliver a cheerful bromantic, especially the latter\nwho takes his character and silliness seriously other than just knowing\nto flex muscles. It might lack in depth to explain about the quest of\nthe mission but it is overall entertaining due to the commitment of the\ncast to bring us laughter.\n"},
{"review": "\nStarted well, but sadly went down hill. I really expected great things\nfrom this movie after all the two main characters can be extremely\nfunny, sadly this was not the case.

{"review": "\nRecently a lot of Kevin Hart's movies have been pretty lack luster. The\nRide Along movies and Get Hard were shredded by critics. When I saw the\ntrailer for Central Intelligence, I thought this would be just another\none of those flicks. Thankfully, I was very wrong! The page here lists\nthe film as an \"action, comedy, crime\" movie but really it is more of a\n\"action, comedy, drama\" flick. Dwayne Johnson plays the gentle giant\nBob Stone/Robby Weirdicht (haha pun) who works for the CIA while Kevin\nHart plays the everyday joe Calvin Joyner (a nice change of pace in my\nopinion). These two are the reason this film works as pure\nentertainment. They have great chemistry together and they play rather\ninteresting characters. Robby is on the same level as Jason Bourne when\nit comes to hand to hand combat and other spy stuff like that but he\nhas the sensitivity and the tastes of a fourteen year old girl. I don't\ncare who you are, you have to admit that's hilarious. Calvin was the\nfavorite student of his high school but now he is just a washed up\naccountant upset with where his life has gone. Hart and Johnson bring\nsome real comedy to their roles as well as true conviction. You can\nbelieve that these two are dealing with some real emotional problems. I\nnever thought of either of them as good actors but they do a splendid\njob here. The stunts they pull also look so very realistic. They are\nvery thrilling and pretty creative too. Now the movie isn't without\nproblems-what movie is? The spy portion of the plot is pretty straight\nforward and shallow. It's obviously just an excuse to get these two\ntogether but is that really such a bad thing when what they are\noffering is so good? Central Intelligence is kind of like that movie\nTwins with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito. Two popular actors\nplay as comic foils to one another as well as provide great drama with\nsome cool stunts thrown in. What more could you want?\n"},
{"review": "\nCentral Intelligence is a great movie with a well developed plot and a\nterrific comedic cast. It's a fun, mindless comedy action that you can\nswitch off from reality while watching and have a good time, there are\nmany side splitting moments and even parts that had me at the edge of\nmy seat. The writers did a great job of making us care for these\ncharacters before they set off on their journey, which helped out in\nthe long run. However, the pacing was certainly slow, it was not as\naction packed and intense as the trailers made it out to be, there's a\nlot of slower moments, even times where I was begging for some plot\ndevelopment instead of mindless comedy. The cast are terrific, Kevin\nHart and Dwayne Johnson shine in the lead roles and their chemistry is\nthe film's highlight, they are joined by a stellar supporting cast that\nincludes Amy Ryan and Aaron Paul, as well as a few brilliant cameos. It\nalso deserves credit for switching roles and getting the lead actors to\ndo something unexpected of them, putting the well known comedian, Hart,\nin a straight role and putting an action star, Johnson, as the\nflamboyant, over the top character, this differentiated the movie,\nmaking it more interesting. Though it may not be as exciting as the\ntrailers made it seem, Central Intelligence is simple fun, and I would\nrecommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. <br><br>An accountant gets himself in trouble with the law after reuniting with\nan old high school acquaintance looking to prove his innocence. <br><br>Best Performance: Aaron Paul\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's quite possible that they cast Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson just\nto make \"Little Hart, Big Johnson\" pun. As far as buddy cop goes, this\ncontrasting nature can provide some chuckles, however the espionage\nthem might not hit all the marks. Still, there are significant amount\nof scenes where laughter is secured by sheer timely body language and\njokes alone.<br><br>Dwayne Johnson plays as Bob, a CIA agent who tries to reach out to his\nold friend. This escalates into a chase for secret files and national\nsecurity. The way Bob is presented relies heavily on juvenile gag and\ndemeanor despite his imposing physique, this is fun at first but it\nhampers the credibility as an agent. The movie wants to add some\nbullying subplot which is commendable, although it doesn't have the\ndepth to accommodate it.<br><br>Kevin Hart is excellent in creating reactions and gestures. He's\nsurprisingly identifiable with high school nostalgia and occasional\nself-doubt. Many of the good moments come from his outbursts and\nbabbling. The script has a few nifty pop references and sometimes even\nwitty gags, so the comedy is not just slapstick throughout and\nundermines the \"intelligence\" in the title.<br><br>There are serious undertones of adult life or self-acceptance even\nthough they are not fully fleshed out. Action is pretty light, it's\npassable without being too demanding. The most important thing is it's\nenjoyable. Sure, there are a few awkward moments, yet they make the\nbest out of it to present a light humorous spectacle, a better buddy\ncop gimmick than expected.\n"},

This movie is more fun than any film I have\nseen in a long time.<br><br>Too often when WWF Wrestler's get into acting, their egos are so large,\nthey can't transfer it into acting or comedy. Dwayne Johnson (aka. The\nRock) does that transfer here. He shows he can act and do comedy with\ngreat skill at both and does not let anything get in his way. Kevin\nHart does not hurt as the two of them with a full foot difference in\nheight really seem to have this down.

Both Amy Ryan and Danielle\nNicolet stand tall here despite being shorter than Kevin Hart. The\nGolden Jet and Bob Stone make this film funny, and the support and\nThurber's Direction pace here are just about perfect.

{"review": "\nOne of my favourite things is when a film is a hybrid of genres \u0096\nhorror comedies, romantic comedies, dramedies and romantic dramas.\nUnfortunately, Central Intelligence is an action comedy which skimps on\nboth the action and the comedy.<br><br>This was disappointing for so many reasons, but mainly because\nexpectations were high with the tagline for the film being such a\nstroke of genius: \"Saving the world takes a little Hart and a big\nJohnson\" (I do love a good pun). I can handle when a film is predicable\nin plot if it makes up for it in other ways, and I was hoping this one\nwould have fresh jokes to counteract the clich\u00e9 story however this is\nwhere it fell short. Kevin Hart's character Calvin Joyner is a\nstraight-laced accountant who was once the high school golden child.

This was probably the only redeeming feature of\nthe film which made it even remotely unique and interesting. With Ike\nBarinholtz as one of the screenwriters, you would think the film would\nhave many more laughs than it did.

I was\nsurprised that Dewayn Johnson would have his name on anything this bad.\nAnd I don't see how it received a PG13 rating when it should have been\nrated R. Let me put it this way. This was the first movie I ever walked\nout on before it ended. For anyone with kids I would suggest picking\nanother movie.

{"review": "\n'CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br><br>An action-comedy buddy flick, starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart.\nIt was directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (who also previously helmed\nother hit comedy flicks, like 'WE'RE THE MILLERS' and 'DODGEBALL'). It\nwas written by Thurber, David Stassen and Ike Barinholtz. The film\ncostars Amy Ryan, Danielle Nicolet and Aaron Paul. It's a pretty funny\nmovie, because of the pairing of Johnson and Hart, and it's also\nsurprisingly touching (at times).<br><br>Johnson plays Bob Stone; a once bullied (and severely overweight) nerd,\nthat's now a lethal CIA agent. Calvin Joyner (Hart) went to high school\nwith Stone; he was really popular, and helped Bob out during a\ntraumatizing incident. So Bob has idolized Calvin ever since. The two\nmeet for drinks, the weekend of their high school reunion, and Calvin\ngets pulled into a life threatening CIA adventure.<br><br>Johnson and Hart have beautiful chemistry together; it really is a\nclassic odd couple pairing! That's the highlight of the movie, but it\nalso has a lot of heart; and a strong message about bullying. It's\ndefinitely 'forced' and 'clich\u00e9d', but it's also (surprisingly)\nemotional. I really enjoyed the movie, for that reason as well. The\nplot, and action scenes, are routine (and forgettable), but the\ncharacter development is awesome!

And\nthen we have the incident we've been waiting for: the meeting of the\ntwo buddies. Then for the next 10 minutes, we have more talk, talk,\ntalk at a bar...one location. So for 20 minutes, it's slow moving and\ngoing nowhere. In the action genre the audience comes prepared to see\naction. There is none. In the last 10 minutes of Act 1, we finally get\na reveal as to the covert work that Dwayne has been doing these past 20\nyears, but it's more talk, talk, talk. Then we have the C.I.A. breaking\nin and we have the spoof of the Bourne series. Okay. I love the acting\nof the two buddies, but the script was so predictable, and yet so\nabysmally boring with talk, talk, talk, the audience was shifting in\ntheir seats from sheer frustration. No spoilers here, but this was an\nidiotic plot with predictable turns. Even the decent chemistry between\nthe stars could not save it for me.\n"},
{"review": "\nCENTRAL INTELLIGENCE: Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and the rest of the\ncast are having a great time in this buddy, espionage, action, comedy\nand so will you.

Johnson may or may not be the\nBlack Badger who may or may not be a rouge CIA operative who is after\nthe codes. The direction keeps the story moving at a crisp pace, the\ncomic timing is spot on, the sight gags are sharp, the action sequences\nare entertaining and it's laugh out loud funny.

There\nwere some awesome nods to shows like the Office and Breaking Bad, like\nhow Amy Ryan was named Pam (receptionist from the Office), and when\nAaron Paul said \"BITCH,\" just like he does in Breaking Bad.

When he is in a scene without Dwayne, and is trying to be\nfunny it falls flat. His over the top style doesn't work when someone\nis being better at it, which Dwayne does in almost every scene. Kevin\nactually does some good acting when he is serious and not trying to\nforce laughter on the audience. <br><br>Also the movie is paced at such perfection that you don't even notice\nthat 2 hours have flown by, and that is important.

{"review": "\nThe smallest man in Hollywood teamed up with the largest man in\nHollywood. Sounds like a recipe for success, right? After all 'Twins'\nin 1988 starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito was considered\na hit. The problem 'Central Intelligence' faces is that its stars have\nalmost zero chemistry together. They are purely working as individuals.\nA film can still survive with its stars doing that, but it does take a\nlot of quality away. Kevin Hart is his usual self, trying to be the\nlife of the party and doing his best Chris Tucker impersonation at the\nsame time. Every movie he's in seems to be almost the same performance\nthese days. Does he have more levels to his acting ability? I'm\nstarting to doubt it. <br><br>Dwayne Johnson on the other hand gives a fairly solid performance. He\nhad layers, with his character changing motives many times throughout\nthe film, and he pulls them all off. He was still lacking the comedic\ntiming that a professional funny-man would have nailed, but his\nenormous physique also lets him pull off jokes that others could not\nget away with. <br><br>Sadly though, both are acting purely on their own and never manage to\nfeed off each other. Luckily for them the script is actually quite\nstrong and well-written which covers a lot of this up. There are some\nquite good action scenes and the story actually has some genuine\nmystery and suspense to it at times. There's a tremendous amount of\nnods to the audience to look out for (one from Aaron Paul of 'Breaking\nBad' is particularly noticeable) and some unexpected cameos that work\nin quite well.

Bob Stone shows\nup right before the twenty-year high school reunion and he has packed\non the muscles from working out six hours everyday for twenty years.<br><br>Stone also has become a CIA agent and involves who he believes is his\nbest friend, the accountant Joyner. Hart is great as the reluctant\naccomplice caught up in a case of international espionage that doesn't\nhave much of a background focusing more on jokes. There are a few spots\nwhere the action pauses to let Hart deliver long comedic monologues\nthat don't always hit as great as his standup does and slows down the\nplot but the comedy is greatly enhanced by The Rock's giddy\nperformance. As a once peculiar kid, Johnson embodies the bullied kid\nWeirdicht who has now become a tough international spy.<br><br>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com\n"},
{"review": "\nI just discovered another \"big\" actor, Dwayne Johnson. He's very big,\n6' 4\" (1.93 m). I can not say that he doesn't have some charm, I\nexpected something much worse from this \"Central Intelligence\". I don't\nknow about Kevin Hart, is he really a gifted comic actor or just a\ntedious presence? The other actors, Amy Ryan, Jason Bateman, Aaron\nPaul, Thomas Kretschmann? They do their best to win their existence,\nit's not easy at all to be an actor, specially when the script it's not\nso good. Anyway, it has some action and some good music. For the level\nof \"intelligence\" in the world today, the film is above. Be careful\nwith the CIA, not to burst over you in the house (or cinema), while you\nwatch it! Everything is possible nowadays...\n"},
{"review": "\nI'd never normally choose to go and see a film like this, but free\nticket. Happy I went. I don't normally laugh out loud in a cinema, and\nthis had me chortling throughout. Many other reviews explain the story\nand the 'chemistry' between the two main actors. But what really struck\nme is what a fine actor Dwayne Johnson is. I guess all those years in\nWWF have paid off. In the movie he plays two very different people, and\nvery believably. He switches effortlessly from one role to another, and\ncan really bring menace to his part. His comedic side was excellent,\nplaying the over-enthusiastic buddy, and delivering banalities with\nsuch sincerity you almost forgot it was scripted. Well written, though\nsometimes Hart's black shtick was a bit overdone, nicely paced after a\nslow start, and really good fun that doesn't take itself too seriously.\nGreat date film, she'll love you for it :)\n"},
{"review": "\nthis is your basic buddy movie, fighting the bad guys, bigotry, racism,\netc. it's not my usual fare, but the movie got pretty good reviews so I\ngave it a try. there is nothing wrong with the movie, exactly: it just\nlacks imagination and spark. the director paints by the numbers and\ngets us from a to z. there are no surprises as far as the film goes and\neverything works out as you expect. when I say no surprises, I can't\nsay that about the two stars. their chemistry is great and I was\nespecially impressed by dwayne Johnson. he is really quite good here.\nhe is a natural and his line readings are right on the money. I suppose\nthere was some amount of acting in his former profession. anyway, it's\na nice little movie. just don't expect a lot. every movie can't be a\n10.\n"},
{"review": "\nDewayne Johnson continues to impress as he pretty much carries the film\nhere. It must be said that he wouldn't be nearly as effective without a\ngood co-lead. Kevin Hart hits a sweet spot here against Johnson. It's a\ngood pairing which works hard to make a ridiculous story work.<br><br>The ugly duckling turn mysterious black swan (i.e.possibly an evil\nswan) begins a wild ride in which Hart's over-acting seems, well,\nnaturally correct. Hart's Calvin Joyner \"The Golden Jet\" character,is\nthe former high school golden boy who has hit a rut. His life is\nsuddenly turned upside down by the one person who was the most bullied\nand downtrodden classmate, now known as Johnson's evolved new man, Bob\nStone. The strange re-union of the two is exemplified by the fact\nthere's a 20-year class reunion looming among all the chaos. <br><br>These two might have hit it even better had the story not been as thin\nand lightweight, but considering all things this is a case where the\ntwo leads gel so well as to make the picture much more enjoyable than\nit has a right to be.\n"},
{"review": "\nSat down wanting to shake off the day over a couple of jars and a few\njokes. After allowing for the slightly clumsy though well acted set-up\nthe pace did not let up for a moment. With two high quality leads and\nexcellent scripts this \"brain off\" funny movie left me and my family in\nstitches. <br><br>I want slapstick and with this vehicle for visual and verbal jokery and\nwas rewarded in spades, this was not an intellectual chuckle, I hurt\nfrom laughing. <br><br>Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Harts swapping of funny/straight lines was\ndone crisply and the best comedic talent was bought out of both actors\nwho balanced hamming it up with some excellent down the line acting. <br><br>The support cast of wives, friends, CIA etc. come straight out of every\nAmerican movie you've ever watched and were done to perfection.<br><br>Well worth it humour for teens and up..\n"},
{"review": "\nThis has got to be the BEST SUMMER COMEDY in 2016. In an era when\ncomedies have slipped into inane stupidity floundering, falling way\nbelow any Animal House level or Spaceball spoof, Central Intelligence\nhas broken the mold with Fantastic Comedy, Pure Adrenaline and\nKick-the-Bully-Heart!<br><br>This movie is inventive, has fabulous misdirection and engaging special\neffects and the chemistry between the male leads simply is a joy to\nwatch. In a head-to-head with Ghostbusters, Central Intelligence\nactually won - thankfully Melissa was in both, but her cameo in Central\nIntelligence was just off the charts adorable and had the audience\nrolling in the aisle! <br><br>Trust me. Go see this movie and you will love it. G-rated enough for\nfamily fun, romantic enough to take your girl, and thrilling enough to\ngo out with a group of friends and come away with laughter, lessons and\nthe hunt for the Black Badger alone will have you asking \"Did you see\nthat Twist coming?\"<br><br>Rock On...\n"},
{"review": "\nThose were her words after the movie. All you really need to know is,\nmy wife and son laughed hysterically often, and I laughed a lot more\nthan I expected to. It's fun, silly and a great time out at the\ntheater. That's it... all you absolutely need to know about the movie.<br><br>(But, I'll add more anyway!) This is not a dark, gritty look into\nAmerican Intelligence Agencies. It's not a somber tale of relationships\nor unrealized potential. It's a wacky, unrealistic, action packed, fun\nfilled COMEDY! And, again, as my wife said, \"If someone doesn't love\nthis movie, I don't want to know them!\" I think that means she gives it\na lot of stars!\n"},
{"review": "\nI know Kevin Hart is a funny guy. We all know The Rock is awesome. This\nmovie just isn't as good or funny as it should be. Maybe it is the\nwriting, maybe it is the directing; I don't know. All I know is if The\nRock or Kevin Hart were not in the movie, it would panned by all the\ncritics and fans. I almost feel bad for The Rock because you see him\ngiving 100% but not even his 100% can help a flat script. The idea\nbehind the movie is great. The idea behind the characters is great. But\nthe execution of the movie just fails. Don't get me wrong, the movie is\nfunny but not as funny as it should be. Kevin Hart and The Rock have to\ndo all the heavy lifting and it is a sad because this could have been\none of those classic comedies you would go back and watch over and over\nagain. Oh, and let us talk about that ending. That ending pretty much\nconfirms that the writing/script kills the movie. I just now took the\ntime to use IMDb to see who wrote this and yeah, go check for yourself.\nIt was the writers who turned this into a C- kind of movie. What a\nshame.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe millions......and millions of the peoples champion will flock to\nsee this film as the trailblazing eyebrow raising never takes a fall\nevan when working with kevin hart who is small, comes to the big\nscreen. This is one of those films that just works you cant explain why\nbut you know it works, central intelligence has a easy to follow script\nand story with some great comedy. Kevin hart is his usual role as the\nbumberling underdog and the rock who plays a CIA agent, the chemistry\nbetween the two works really well which you see clearly through out the\nfilm. Plenty of action, simple story, enjoyable characters and overall\ncentral intelligence works from start to finish.\n"},
{"review": "\nCentral Intelligence was hilarious. Sione Kelepi delivered a\nquintessential high school bullying victim who returns as Dwayne\nJohnson's portrayal of a super agent. Kevin Hart played the burnt out\nall star whose workplace nemesis is Ryan Hansen's character. Danielle\nNicolet's role as a supportive yet uncertain wife pit Dwayne and Kevin\nagainst each other for one of the movie's funniest scenes. These two\nfinally joined forces and faced their grownup high school bully, Jason\nBateman, while defeating a crime syndicate. Rawson Marshall Thurber,\nthe movie's director, captured the comedic chemistry among this cast\nwhile employing very basic cinematography.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was easily one of the funniest movies I have seen in quite a\nwhile. The plot is focused around Calvin, an accountant who was very\nsuccessful now a failure and Bob (formally Robert) who was a failure in\nhigh school now ex-member of the CIA. Bob eventually gets Calvin to\nhelp him find encryption codes that have been stolen. The plot to this\nmovie, well, was not memorable. Why did I give it 10 stars then? I was\nnot expecting a good plot. I was expecting comedy and fun and action,\nalthough not too much as that would ruin the comedic atmosphere and\nthis movie performed. Kevin Hart's performance was outstanding in this\nfilm and I would definitely be interested in watching more of the work\nhe is in. Dwayne Johnson in this film is awesome and I personally think\nthat he should be in more of these types of films; funny action movies.\nWould recommend it for anyone wanting a good time.\n"},

{"review": "\nI'm a Johnson &amp; Hart fan but this movie lacks chemistry as oppose to\nHart &amp; Ice Cube. Johnson's character was poorly written and it was\nevident in the movie that the Rock was struggling to produce a natural\ncomedic performance. Spoilers: the movie wanted to do a twist in\nJohnson's character by having him portray to be good and bad which\nreally makes it weird how near the end, Johnson gave a smirk after\nturning away from Hart as he enters the underground parking. Bateman's\ncharacter, Trevor, felt weird and out of place as an adult. I just feel\nthat the script was poorly written and the movie kind of reminds me of\nAdam Sandler's Do Over but with better writing and performances. I want\nto give it 3.5 but round up to 4/10\n"},
{"review": "\nAs if there's not a high school geek in the world he does not want to\ngrow up to become the most electrifying man in showbiz, Dwayne Johnson\nplays a CIA agent still effected by the kids who bullied him twenty\nyears ago. It was hard to believe that someone like The Rock is a die\nhard fan of unicorns and the 80s movie Sixteen Candles, but Johnson\nonly proves his talents.<br><br>It was more surprising how Johnson carried this film on his very big\nshoulders being the screwball side of this comedic duo. Most\nimportantly, we do get to see the Rock kick ass and take names (while\nwearing a fanny pack, but...) He's action, He's comedy, And I can\ndefinitely smell what he's cooking. <br><br>And if the Rock is not enough for you, Kevin Hart is in it too. One of\nthe funnest men in movies today. Though I must admit, Kevin Hart is not\nat his funniest being Johnson's straight man, and I could have used a\nfew more direct laughs from his side of the table, but the two men are\na real dynamic duo on the big screen. <br><br>Central Intelligence is a good time at the movies.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was invited to see this movie last minute, unprepared for what it was\nabout or anything.

I would put\nthis down to the fact that there was no real story line, this movie\nfelt like it was all over the place.<br><br>I found myself rather bored throughout a lot of the movie, and ended up\nscrolling through Facebook to pass the time. <br><br>I really would recommend saving your money, definitely not worth the\ntime or money.\n"},
{"review": "\nVideo Review link is at the bottom. I am not the best typer so I would\nrecommend going to the video instead. <br><br>Central Intelligence is a buddy cop film starring Kevin Hart and Dwayne\nJohnson. They both have exceedingly good chemistry in the film with\nKevin being this guy who you can relate to after high school and Dwayne\nplaying a socially awkward CIA agent. Both these two come together to\ntake down a huge deal involving multiple countries. Although their\nchemistry is strong at first it begins to get awkward at times even for\nthe audience and they can make you stray away from enjoying the movie.\nSome of their scenes feel forced and sometimes the movie can obsess too\nmuch into the spy stuff going on. In other words, most of the movie is\ngood, and most of their relationship is great. Just be wary of the\nflaws the movie has. <br><br>Video Review link is right here.

{"review": "\nThis movie Central Intelligence is a hilarious action comedy. This\nmovie mixes humor with action at the same time, and Kevin Hart and\nDwayne Johnson are a great pair together as their acting is\noutstanding. I read the reviews and noticed that the critics judged the\nmovie by saying it was a typical buddy cop comedy movie such as \"21,22\nJump Street, but they are wrong because the plot is very easy to\nunderstand and it stands out of 21 Jump Street or any other buddy cop\nmovie. This film has a message to it which is about bullying. Bob Stone\nback in the day was known as Robbie Werdicht and was bullied and thrown\nout naked onto the gym. While Calvin \"The Golden Jett\" Joyner was the\nall star of the whole school and was very popular. Calvin helps Robbie\nby giving him is Letterman jacket, so Robbie could walk out of the gym\ncovering his private part, while the whole gym just laughed at Robbie.\n20 years later Bob shows up to his high school reunion looking tough\nand it shows that people can change as Bob did. Bob stands on the stage\nall proud and shows that even if I was bullied I am a changed man now.\nI think that many people should watch this movie because it has a great\nmessage to it. The one thing that could've been better about the film\nis the plot, but overall great film!\n"},
{"review": "\nSorry, but way too many swear words and sexual innuendo for a PG-13\nmovie. The opening scene which exposes a rear-end is funny and I really\ndidn't have a problem with it. But all the references to intercourse,\noral sex, etc. were really too much and took away from what would be a\ngreat movie. If my 13 year old and I have to look at each other 5-6\ntimes during a movie with angst, then it's too much. I would let a\n15-16 year old see this but not a 13YO. The movie was really funny and\nwould have been an 8* if it wasn't for the overkill, silly/sex\ndialogues. I thought the plot was good and kept you guessing until the\nend and there were plenty of funny moments--just too gratuitous with\nthe \"bad stuff.\"\n"},
{"review": "\nNot being a Kevin Hart fan, I did not expect to laugh as hard as I did\nwatching Central Intelligence, because I had my expectations so low to\nbegin with. Almost everything in this buddy action comedy hits the\nright notes- the execution of the plot, the chemistry between the cast,\nthe performances of the cast themselves(The Rock was the bomb!), the\nexecution of the humor, the charming anti-bullying message(wasn't\ncringe-worthy like other movies), the film's goofy self-awareness, the\ncreative action sequences and most of all, the way the two main\ncharacters interact. What makes this movie genuinely funny is the\nentertainment Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart provide with their energy\nwhile improvising(Hart's at his best with his stand-up, here) their\njokes- the whole audience was laughing heartily and loudly throughout\nthe movie mainly because of this reason. It sounds like I'm going too\nfair on this movie because people aren't raving on and on about it- but\nfor how hard I laughed during this movie, I'll shift my rating to a 9,\nas such an accomplishment deserves such a rating, especially for this\nnon-Hart fan.\n"},
{"review": "\nOK, it wasn't utterly terrible but it's by far the Rock's worst outing\nwhich disappointed me quite a bit since I\"m a fan and tuned in\nspecifically to see him in action. <br><br>Contrasting that, Kevin Hart, someone who never moved my needle any,\ntruly showed quite a bit of good stuff. I think it's fair to say he\nsaved the show. He showed a good deal of range without the 'feets do\nyour stuff' eye rolling I was half expecting. <br><br>Rock's character just isn't believable or likable. He varies from\nwheedling to bullying to whatever. The plot is supposed to have a bit\nof tension about who the bad guy is and toward the end throws Jesse\nPinkman in as Jesse Pinkman for those Breaking Bad fans everywhere. <br><br>The ending left, to say the least, a very bad taste. It pure\nembarrassment amped up ten times. There were any number of dignified\nways to wrap this one up but the director choose the least appealing.\nAppealing? It was appalling. <br><br>A minor diversion made at least somewhat worthwhile due to Hart's\ncharacter. Else, nothing much and surely NOT a place for a Rock fan.\n"}
