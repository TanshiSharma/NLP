{"review": "\n\nAmerican Beauty is the greatest movie ever made.<br><br>If you haven't already, watch American Beauty by yourself and give yourself\nsome time afterwards to think it over. You will never, ever look at life\nthe\nsame way. It does exactly what movies are meant to do - give us a window\ninto ourselves, and American Beauty does that better than any other film\nhas\never done. No word of dialogue is unnecessary, no character exaggerated,\neverything is perfect...but if you have seen American Beauty you should\nknow\nthat already. Once you look closer at this movie, and see Beauty in every\nframe, it becomes so much easier to look closer and see Beauty in\neverything\naround you. You think I'm waxing poetic? Then you must not have seen the\nmovie. Every character is a part of each of us: the Lester Burnham of\nchange, the Carolyn of uncertainty and failure, the rebellion of Jane, the\ndefeated Barbara, the false control of Angela and the Colonel, and the real\ncontrol of Ricky. To me Ricky, not Lester, is the center of this story; he\nsomehow controls or sets in motion the heart of Lester's rebirth and\ndownfall. There are several parts of this movie where I lose control every\ntime I see it, and none more so than the paper bag scene. To me that scene\nis simply the greatest monologue ever written.<br><br>I listened to the message of American Beauty - look closely and you can\nfind\nBeauty in anything - and it changed my life. I rose out of a long, deep\ndepression and started out into the world. Sometimes there is so much\nBeauty\nin the world, I can't even stand it, and it feels like my heart is going to\nburst.<br><br>This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nProbably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks\ntwo fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam\nMendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling\nefforts).<br><br>Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of a\nmid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his\nteenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter\n(Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; \"a typical teenager. Angry,\ninsecure, confused...\". And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) has\nan obsession of her own, her public appearance.<br><br>Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new\nneighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the\noutside.<br><br>As life begins to improve (with most of the main characters finding\nwhat they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comes\ncrashing down in the climactic final day.<br><br>The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more\namazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film\nscreen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experience\nwriting TV sitcoms -  not  that you'd be able to guess from the tone\nof this film).<br><br>The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes\nmanages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast,\nwho are all faultless. No doubt Mendes' theatre directing past\nplayed a huge part in directing the actors so well.<br><br>Another person worthy of a mention is the late director of\nphotography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscar\nrecipients for this film.<br><br>All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one\nsuperb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, steals\nthis film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what\nit is. Truly an ensemble effort. 10/10.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie was a joy to watch.  I didn't know what to expect when I came\ninto it.  I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've\nall heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.<br><br>Kevin Spacey plays this part to a \"T\".  He is strong when it requires and\nmeek when it is needed.  His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to\npartake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well.  I think they both should\nbe nominated.<br><br>The support cast is also spectacular.  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena\nSuvari all give great performances as the troubled \"Teenagers\" in the film.\nOf particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance, worthy of a supporting\nnomination as well.<br><br>This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of\nturmoil and transition.  When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his\ndaughter's at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated with\nher beauty.  Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change all\naspects of his life.  He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and his\nlibido.<br><br>The music in this film is also very well chosen.  There are moments when the\nmusic fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to\npresent a perfect emotion.<br><br>The plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to see\nwhere you go.  I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.<br><br>See this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out now\nthat are dare I say, trash.<br><br>This should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it is\ncertainly on top of mine.<br><br>My Rating (1 - 10):  10<br><br>\n"},
{"review": "\nThe intention is so clear that everything else falls into place,\nperfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me of\nhis character in \"The Ref\" and that could only be a good thing. Annette\nBening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloid\nversion of a \"Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf\" Which means very close to\nsomeone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing\ndexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West\nBentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing\nthis 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole\nhullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major\nstar. He is amazing in \"American Beauty\" the complexities of his\ncharacter are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face\nup to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object of\nhis attention and the film, I believe, is here to say.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWhat can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster.  I\nwent in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it\nwould be worth the ticket price.  Boy was I happy when I left.  Not only was\nit worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times.  This film is\nvirtually perfect.  The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the\nnarrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly\ngroundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes).  What really\nsurprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done.  In a\nsmall,\ncharacter driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great\ncinematography.  With this film, there is something interesting going on in\nevery scene, not many films you can say that about.  In a year where first\ntime directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John\nMalkovich, etc...  Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all.  Though I\nhave yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that\neither film will out-shine American Beauty.  This film should easily win a\nsubstantial amount of the Oscars this year.  What's up with all the cirtics\nawards snubbing it so far?\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis piece of sitcommy, cliche-ridden claptrap is just smart enough on its\nsurface for the middlebrow Academy to pimp it for a Best Picture Oscar. But\nanyone with half a brain will see through this tired male fantasy pretty\nsoon. Mendes shows us a Edward Scissorhands-type of suburbia: perfect\nlawns,\nidentical homes, etc... We are expected to know (since we've seen ES, Ice\nStorm, Happiness, Serial Mom, etc.) that these people must lead shallow,\nempty lives - look where they live! And... they do! This is just the first\nof many obvious themes that we have seen so many times before. And we\nhaven't even reached Spacey's character's midlife crisis yet. (Surprise! He\nfalls in sexual lust with a gorgeous high-school blonde. Sooooo subversive!\nLook closer, and you'll find even more cliches.) Spacey's wife is,\npredictably, a self-centered shrew who won't satisfy him sexually but cooks\ndelicious nutritious dinners and sells (surprise) real estate. His daughter\nis a misfit (wow!) with whom he can't connect. The new kid on the block (of\ncourse there is one) is a weird, sensitive (but handsome) loner type\n(shocker) who (believe it or not) falls for Spacey's moody daughter. Don;t\neven ask about the gay neighbors. Mendes does nothing but condescend to his\ncharacters, his setting, and above all, the audience. Positives: Thora\nBirch\nis terrific and lovely; Mena Suvari is breathtakingly beautiful, and the\nplastic bag sequence is affecting. Pretentious c***. \n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis is a profound movie that examines ordinary people.  For all their\nflaws\npeople are basically beautiful and that is one of the many threads of the\nfabric of this film.  I liked that it was revealed at the start of the film\nthat Lester would soon meet his demise.  And I also liked at the ending,\nthe\nidentity of the person who took his life didn't really matter, just the\nsadness of the loss of his life.  'Look Closer' was the theme of this movie\nand Lester even had this motto in his cubical.  Kevin assumed the persona\nof\nLester with a range of acting that is quite worthy of awards.  Bening\ninhabited Carolyn in much the same way.  Which one of us hasn't experienced\nthe disillusionment of our teenage years, only to later re-experienced it\nagain through our children.  And like Carolyn, who among us has not been\nintensely disappointed with ourself at some point?  That one scene was\namazing, it looked so real that it transcended acting.  And can a movie\nactually move beyond entertainment by causing more than absorbing\ndiscussion, but real change in it's audience?  Perhaps.  But if this is\ntrue, then that movie would be American Beauty.  And for those who feel\nthis\nmovie doesn't achieve this lofty accolade.  To them I say, \"Never\nunderestimate the power of denial.\"  A ten, of course.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie and\nabout a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about and\nthen say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like this\nmovie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. This\nis one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performances\nare one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The\ndirecting by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar.\nAlan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and\nthere's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the\nBest of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out(\nGoodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was the\nfirst movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and\nover so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This\nmovie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank\nnumber 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was\nthe only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven\nSpacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey\nbrings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great\ncharacter. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the\nOscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much,\nalso did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and\nshould have more notice. Sam Mendes does a great directing job and is\none the best film debut ever.

{"review": "\nMuch-praised film about a man facing mid-life crisis in suburbia,\ndreaming of playing Humbert Humbert to a Lolita that is his daughter's\nfriend. There is only one word to describe this film: pretentious.\nMendes thinks he is making the Great American Motion Picture but it is\npopulated with cookie-cutter characters and it superficially touches on\nwhat the filmmakers regard as important themes. The acting is mediocre\nat best. Spacey gives the kind of performance that the Academy loves\nand awarded him with the Oscar but his acting here can be best\ndescribed as mugging.

{"review": "\n\nWatching \"American Beauty\" is like looking into a handful of American lives\nslowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people\nare gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing\ntheir grip on human value and order. This is not your average social\ncommentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand,\nthis\nis a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a\nseemingly \"perfect\" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if\neveryone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the\npainful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand,\n\"American Beauty\" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating\ncharacter study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in\ntheir lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves\nand each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably\nfollow.\n\"American Beauty\" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of\nbeauty fused with violence and tragedy, to it's darkly hilarious script,\nthis is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the\nmain thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey\nand\nAnette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple\nexploring new realms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and\nThora Birch also showcase excellent performances. A truly remarkable\nfilm.\n"},

{"review": "\n\nMy fiancee &amp; I saw this movie at a sneak preview showing in her college. \nThe big lab building was filled with mature college students, and there were\nthose who still haven't grown up yet.  The lights dimmed and the movie\nstarted.  It started out with Lester Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey), in a\nshort monologue with an overview of the city they live in.  From that moment\nuntil the ending credits rolled, I did not blink, I did not budge...except\nwhen I laughed...and BOY did I laugh.  The movie itself was a bit....shall I\nsay..oh...weird.

Although these people\nare gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing\ntheir grip on human value and order. This is not your average social\ncommentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand,\nthis\nis a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a\nseemingly \"perfect\" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if\neveryone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the\npainful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand,\n\"American Beauty\" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating\ncharacter study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in\ntheir lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves\nand each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably\nfollow.\n\"American Beauty\" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of\nbeauty fused with immorality, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one\nof those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the main thing\nthat makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey and Anette\nBenning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new\nrealms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch\nalso\nshowcase excellent performances. A truly remarkable film.\n"},

This is a WONDERFUL movie that is worth the\nmoney\nto see in the theaters (the only movie I've been to where half the audience\nbroke into applause during the film).

There are a few interwoven story lines involving Spacey's\nrelationship with his control freak wife (Annette Bening, who is good if a\nlittle bit over the top in this role) and daughter, and the family next\ndoor, which includes a military general father, a mother who is apparently\nclinically depressed, and a very interesting son who is obsessed with\nfilming beautiful things (including Lester's daughter Jane).  What is\nunusual about this movie is that the plot is not unusual or particularly\nunique--it's a couple of families in an anonymous American suburb and how\nthey relate--but the filming of the movie is absolutely beautiful, and is\ndone in a way that makes the film alternately hilarious, heartbreaking, and\nhorrific.

Both films are\nmasterpieces in their individual ways, but it says something about Hollywood\nthat American Beauty will probably win the Oscar, whereas Fight Club\nprobably won't even be nominated.<br><br>On top of this, one can only marvel at the performances, at Thomas Newman's\nwonderful and memorable score, at Conrad Hall's glowing photography, at the\npoised and profound script, and at Mendes's loving direction, his debt to\ntheatre immediately obvious. The plastic bag sequence had me in tears. If a\nfilm leaves me feeling, as Ricky puts it, that God has looked straight at\nyou, then I give it a 10, whatever its flaws. Like Good Will Hunting, this\nfilm transcends cinema and touches your life, without ever stirring your\ncynicism. For that reason alone, American Beauty is a triumph.\n"},

The director and\nstars were available for half an hour after the movie for a Q&amp;A session. \nOne thing that I found interesting was that the movie's budget according to\nthe director was only $15 million.  (That, and the plastic bag scene was\nfilmed by the director with his own home video camera in a parking lot\nsomewhere in L.A. - by himself!)<br><br>Although this movie has a lot of humourous moments and scenes that are\nobviously designed to make the viewer laugh, it is first and foremost a\ndrama.  Artistically filmed (sometimes with characters looking directly at\nthe viewer and narration giving plot points away) this film is very unique. <br><br>It truly takes the viewer into the lives of its characters.  There is more\ncharacter development in this movie than in most any other movie you have\nprobably seen.  <br><br>Annette Bening portrays her character perfectly.  Her acting is, as usual,\nsuperb - but the character really isn't too meaty.  Mena Suvari and Thora\nBirch play their roles perfectly, also.  We truly grow and learn about life\nthrough Kevin Spacey's character's eyes.  <br><br>The true surprise, for me anyway, was Wes Bentley.  The audience is taught\nto see beauty through his character.  If you thought you knew what beauty\nwas - or how to live life - then you will learn again.  Everybody, I hope,\nhas felt what the character Ricky has felt (the pure joy of witnessing raw\nbeauty) - but he describes it in words and shows you with expressions so\nthat his wonder at true beauty is a visual representation of what you know\nto have felt inside you.  <br><br>You will walk away from this movie touched inside.  Let it teach you\nsomething about how to live life and how to appreciate true beauty. \n\n"},

The film itself is the\nbest I have seen this year - a drama with humor, excellent acting, an\nuntouchable script, a the capability to leave its audience in thought about\nlife issues that we should reflect on more often.  The director, producers,\nand four of the main actors (everyone except Annette Bening) took questions\nafterwards (most of which were quite disappointing non-questions and\nstar-induced, voice-quavering pleas for autographs or hugs).  The entire\naudience was quite animated throughout, clapped enormously at the end, and\nenjoyed themselves tremendously.  I think audiences across the world are\ngoing to find themselves clapping at the end of this film - something we\ndesperately need more of from Hollywood.  <br><br>Also note, (a) the producers mentioned that they made this film for approx\n$15 million dollars - quite an accomplishment, and (b) this is Mr. Mendes'\nfirst film directing effort - he will be deservably lauded for this work. <br><br>Those involved with film have reason to be proud.  It reasserts my (failing)\nbelief that there is still genius in Southern California, on\noccasion...\n"},

It's deservedly rated R for some\nlanguage and sexual situations, but doesn't go overboard with either.\n'American Beauty' makes no attempt to preach a moral nor would one work\nbecause we are seeing the most extreme of every personal and family\nstereotype, and very humorously in many cases, heavy-handed in others. An\nadditional plus is the music, which uses deep bass in conjunction with\nsubtle piano strokes to create a black comedy atmosphere for the ages. \n\n"},

On the surface, the family seems like a picture-perfect family\nthat everybody dreams about--but inside is a completely different\nmatter. His wife is obsessed with material possessions and doesn't care\nfor \"petty\" things like love or life, while his daughter resents\nherself because she isn't \"perfect.\" Lester's mental coma is rudely\ninterrupted when he meets his daughter's friend and starts fantasizing\nabout her. The awakening might be due to a disturbing thought or\nfeeling, but the wake-up call changes Lester and allows him to realize\nthat there's always time to erase his \"forced-image\" and be the person\nhe really is. This is all a set-up for a funny, disturbing and tragic\nmovie. I don't know about everybody else, but my mind was literally\nracing around when this movie was playing before my eyes.

{"review": "\nAmerican Beauty is a romantic comedy that doesn't suck, which is a nice\nbreak. It follows a man stuck in an unhealthy relationship with his\nwife and eventually falls in love with his 16-year-old daughter's best\nfriend. It's an unconventional love story, and it's done beautifully. <br><br>The plot is great. It's presented in a very comedic way and it's\nactually very funny. It's interesting and realistic, which is a little\nsurprising, but nothing ever felt out of place. The subplot is also\nvery good, and while I think we've all seen it before I think that it\nwas the more relatable and serious of both plots, which created a\nreally nice balance of both fun and seriousness.<br><br>The characters are quite good too. You have a good idea of who they\nare, and they aren't horribly far-fetched either. All of them were\nflawed people, but not so flawed and that they were obviously fake.

Almost all the characters are, although seemingly \"normal\", are\nliving pathetic lives- all except the boy- who-shoots. It is revealed\nlater on why he is way ahead of all other characters in terms of\nappreciation of \"beauty\" as he calls it. The film showcases a drastic\ntransformation in the lives of every character. The facades come\ncrumbling down. All the tightly- knitted culturedness, normalcy's,\nbelief-systems come apart as characters discover how pathetic all their\nlives are. The younger generation is more open to changes, the elders-\nthe more they resist change- the more frustrated they become. Meanwhile\nit is revealed that the most straight-jacketed (in terms of\nconservative notions like homosexuality, marriage, discipline) is a\nsecret admirer of fascism and the most sorrowful character. Slowly, as\nall the characters let go and accept their natural feelings, instincts,\ndesires- sometimes bordering on scandalous- they feel better, relaxed,\nhappier. All but one is transformed. <br><br>The film describes how heavy orthodox beliefs can get, how they have\nthe power of consuming people's lives, harming people.

{"review": "\nI loved this movie.I have had this mad crush on Kevin Spacey since I\nfirst saw it.I have probably seen it at least 10 times. The\nrelationship that he and Mena Suvari have is so (out there).It reminded\nme of my own (pre) mature thoughts about older men ,when I was younger.\nI really liked the oddness of it all.There were so many twists and\nturns that you did not know what to expect until they happened.It was\nuplifting to see Lester get his independence.He made it all so worth\nit. For those of you that have never seen the TV movie \"Homeless to\nHarvard\" with Thora Birch you are missing a really good performance.\nAmerican Beauty is by far one of my favorite top 10 movies of all time.<br><br>Becky Brown , Fort Worth Texas\n"},
{"review": "\nMy new favorite movie! I would never have watched this movie outside of\nmy high school Film Studies class. But the first two minutes of the\nfilm seemed to have got my attention. I felt that the tone of the movie\nwas really interesting. Most of the film was quiet and wasn't action\npacked like most movies that typical high schooler's watch. In the\nbeginning, the movie was really mellow and then slowly the intensity\nstarted to build up. The thing that helped make the movie so great was\nthe music. It's a type of music I can't explain. It gave the movie that\ncertain tone that it has.<br><br>The characters in the movie were great! And if Lester was played by\nsomeone other than Kevin Spacey, the film would not be as good. I love\nLester Burnham, he's so laid back, he doesn't really get angry at all.\nHe only loses his temper one time in the movie and I found it hilarious\nbecause it was so random.<br><br>It's just a great movie, you have to watch it! <br><br>Best quote- \"Would someone pass me the *&amp;%^(#$ Asparagus!\"\n"},
{"review": "\nSam Mendes does a great job showing the troubles and problems a\nteenager might go through during their high school career. I'd have to\nsay that this movie was more based around the father's life and his\nproblems with it. Mendes really portrays well what a troubled father\nready to give it all up might do to get things to go his way. The\ncreepy neighbor boy was a bit far fetched but added the third part of\nthe story that i believe it needed. The use of roses was amazing and\nwere perfect for the times they were used. the cast for this was a\nperfect selection. Kevin Spacey played a perfect role as the miserable\nfather/husband. Thora Birch was the best choice for a wanna popular\ndark teenager. Overall this was a great movie to watch and one worth\nits time.\n"},
{"review": "\nIn the footsteps of David Lynch, this film explores the nightmare\nunderbelly of suburbia USA, when ordinary people try to be\nextraordinary. With dire results. Beautifully crafted, and with a\ndefinitive performance by Kevin Spacey, ably supported by a great cast,\nthis is a standout film. A man in middle age crisis, feeling himself to\nbe a loser in every respect, becomes infatuated with a young girl\nfriend of his daughter. Revives his zest for living, but complications\ninclude a homophobic neighbor, with a weird son; his wife having a\nrelationship with the Real Estate King, and his daughter becoming\ninvolved with the weirdo next door.

{"review": "\nThis is truly an excellent movie. However I can see why some people do\nnot enjoy nor like this movie, this is by no means the kind of movie\nyou grab some pop corn and drink then watch through it. This is a movie\nthat requires you to concentrate on every scene, and think about the\nmeanings behind them. That is what makes this movie great.<br><br>Unlike most movies in nowdays, there is no hero, there is no running\nchasing blowing things up to give the audiences adrenaline rush. This\nis a drama that will make you re-evaluable your life with respect to\nyour culture, every protocol we know in life versus our desire to seek\nhappiness. It is a movie that in a very realistically subconscious way\ndepict our modern lives.<br><br>I will not go in much detail here to spoil the movie, if you have not\nseen this movie, see it.

All the bad actions, the secrets, the lies, the supposed\nbeauty... perfection. That's not beauty. I think the movie just... stay\nin the brain and the thoughts of everyone who see it.

{"review": "\n\nI have this movie on DVD and I watch it over and over again, and Alan Ball\nand Sam Mendes have shown me the omphh that has been missing in other films\nfor a long time. I subscribe to a lot of the accolades to this film, but I\ndo not think that it deserved Best Picture. It was an excellent film- but\nnot an important one. As a kid, I grew up in suburban Orange County where\nthere was truly a lot more than what seemed. I've seen comments posted that\nstate that all of the \"corruption\" just isn't there: \"fascist, repressed\nMarine Corps colonels; middle-aged men obsessed with high school girls;\ndrug\ndistribution amongst teenagers; etc.\" Well, I have news for those soccer\nmoms who like to live in their hermedically sealed worlds and listen to\nCeline Dion- \"LOOK CLOSER\"! Kevin Spacey deserved Best Actor and Annette\nBening was quite impressive as the two-faced housewife. The supporting\ncharacters were just as good and this movie never seemed to drag. It is not\nfor everyone: it is unsettling, disturbing and somewhat raw. But a majority\nof conservative societies don't want the kind of in-your-face dynamic which\nthis movie has. Well, okay. That's why they have movies like \"Stuart\nLittle.\"  \n"},
{"review": "\n\nAmerican Beauty is a great movie about beauty. Everything you see in this\nmovie is beautiful, even those which seem ugly. Kevin Spacy acts Lester\ncharacter delicately and beautifully. The script is so powerful containing\ngreat dialogues mixed with remarkable scenes.

I felt every characters in the movie. And at last, the name of the\nmovie is some kind of a metaphor. Because American Beauty is the name of the\nvariety of hybrid rose.(according to Webster Dictionary) Spielberg has found\na new talent again(Sam Mendes) and of course Sam has done a great job for\nhis movie directing debut.

{"review": "\nWhy has this dreary little piece of suburban angst become such a\nfavorite with so many people? The whole premise is abominable: after\nlosing his job, hen-pecked Kevin Spacey (an actor whose appeal is\nbeyond me) starts buying pot from a high school kid and drooling over\nhis lovely teenage daughter's Lolita-ish friend. What's so hip or\nrevolutionary about working out, listening to classic rock, or smoking\npot? Spacey acts like he's in prison (although with his shrewish wife,\nplayed by a grating Annette Bening, maybe he is). Then there's the\nself-hating repressed homosexual Marine Corps colonel, a stereotypical\nfigure played without a shred of subtilty by Chris Cooper. Where's R.\nLee Ermey when you need him? Then there's the eponymous \"American\nBeauty.\" Mena Suvari is no doubt a cute girl, but she's not really\nbeautiful. Thora Birch, the daughter in the film, is far better\nlooking. But there's something creepy about building a whole film\naround ephebophilia. This is one of the few films I ever bought on DVD\nthat I was unable to watch more than once. I gave it to my cousin for\nChristmas. Now I have to spend the next twelve months dreading what her\npayback will be come Yuletide.\n"},
{"review": "\nAmerican Beauty shows the contrast between the two faces of America.<br><br>American Beauty extends the idea that nothing is ever perfect.

{"review": "\nThis has to possibly be one of the greatest.....screenplays of all\ntime. That's right, screenplays. I didn't much care for the movie\nitself, but I had an edge: before ever seeing the movie, or knowing who\nthe actors in the main roles were, I read the screenplay by Alan Ball -\nand fell in love. The way it was written, the sheer POETRY of the\nwords, made me want to just sit there and read for the rest of my life.\nI could physically see the action happening in my head, without even\nknowing who played the characters, and every single word was just as\nimpactful (if not more) than if I had seen it on the big screen.<br><br>This is an overall EXCELLENTLY written movie, with an incredible plot\nline and especially the twisted ending.

{"review": "\nI view the characters in this film much as I view the characters in\nJohn Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men'. Each character in the book has\ntheir dreams, their goals, whether simple or fancy, they are dreams and\nmost of them know deep down that they will never get there, but in\norder to lift themselves from the reality they are in, they need\nsomething to look forward to. In each character is a desire to be\nsomewhere else, and in each character there is a major flaw, a\nweakness. In creating characters like these, Steinbeck has given each\ncharacter redeeming features in such a way, that however hard you try,\nyou cannot pick out a villain. Each and every character is a 'good\nguy', but each has their flaws that lead them to tragedy, and that is\nan excellent dynamic. <br><br>In American Beauty, Lester, Janie, Angela, Carolyn, Ricky and Frank are\nall made out to be bad guys in some way or other, but each have their\ndreams, each have their flaws and they are all led to tragedy in one\nway or another because of them. Oh, and each are 'ordinary'. Its this\nCharacterisation that really makes the film, aside from the cracking\ncinematography, acting, direction and ball-busting script. I would be\nvery surprised if Alan Ball's inspiration was not partly because of\nSteinbeck. As you can see, I love this film.\n"},

{"review": "\nAmerican Beauty, released in 1999 and starring Kevin Spacey, Annette\nBening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari, couldn't be ordinary\nif it tried. The movie is a deep, wonderful, and penetrating film that\nwill leave the viewer not only questioning their life, but American\nsociety as a whole. The movie hits on many key points ranging from\nconformity in society to individual perception, and really hits home\nthe concept of social disillusionment. The tag line of this movie is\n\"Look Closer\", which is exactly what American Beauty does with its\nportrayal of the Burnham and Fitz families. On the surface both\nfamilies appear to be well-off and happy, but in reality they are\nstruggling greatly with what they want and what they think will make\nthem fit into society. For example, Colonel Fitz on the surface\ndespises homosexuals because he believes that they are not conforming\nto society's view on marriage, however, in reality he is upset that he\ncannot break the bonds of social conformism and be gay himself. The\ntruth is, the only happy people in the movie or those who are able to\nbreak from society's rules and live their lives according to their own\nperceptions\u0085unfortunately for most, they reap the consequences society\ndeals to those who are unwilling to bend. Ricky Fitz is sent to a\nmental institution and ostracized by society because he does not keep\nthe society's view on beauty. And Lester Burnham, though finally able\nto embrace happiness after waking from his twenty year coma, is killed.\nAmerican Beauty combines not only great acting and directing, but also\nincludes the audience by asking many questions that will make them stop\nand evaluate their own lives.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nEnough pro and con comments have been written about this so-called\nOscar-winning \"masterpiece\" for me to make this review a brief one--but to\nthe point. 'American Beauty' took up too much time to tell a relatively\nuncomplicated story of mid-life crisis involving several severely\ndisfunctional personalities. If it gives you pleasure to watch Kevin Spacey\nbe little more than sarcastic for two hours or to watch a shallow youth show\nyou a plastic bag pushed about by the wind as a sample of beauty in little\nthings, then this movie is for you. The only genuinely moving and original\ncharacter in the movie is not Spacey--it's Chris Cooper as the homophobic\nneighbor who suspects his son is having an affair--with tragic results. His\nperformance in the climactic garage scene is stunning. The symbolism of the\nrose petals was overplayed and much too simplistic. As was the lengthy shot\nof the floating plastic bag which so many viewers found deep meaning in--but\nstruck me as arty, pretentious and boring. With a rambling and vulgar\nscript, this emerged as no more than a sad commentary on the complete\ncollapse of American culture. All of the characters are not only weird but\nunlikeable. For me, this was an ordeal to sit through--the only jolt I got\nwas from the ending (which took too long to get to)-- and then, mercifully,\nI was able to take the cassette out, certain that I would never want to view\nthe movie again, despite the fact that it won a Best Film Oscar.  As someone\nonce said, \"the mirror of life should be tilted upwards\" more often to make\nfilms more inspirational. The gutter is not a pleasant place to spend two\nhours of your life--look for true beauty elsewhere. A big thumbs down on\nthis one.\n"},
{"review": "\nAmerican Beauty is an exploration of midlife crisis and the illusion of\na 'normal' family. Lester Burnham (Spacey), his highly strung wife\nCarolyn (Bening) and resentful daughter Jane (Birch) each struggle to\nfind a sense of purpose to their lives as the facade of their happy\nhome deteriorates. The story follows Lester on a journey to turn his\nlife around after meeting his daughter's provocative friend Angela\n(Suvari). His lust for the teenage girl inspires a new lust for youth\nwhich he captures by discarding all of adult life's responsibilities in\nan attempt to re-live his youth. As he quits his respectable job, takes\non a position flipping burgers in a fast food joint, and starts smoking\npot he finally gets the object of his desire \u0096 but was it really what\nhe was looking for? Kevin Spacey's performance as the world-weary and\nrebellious Burnham is magnificent. The honesty which Lester gives off\nwhile everything around him radiates artificiality is astonishingly\npowerful - aided in no small way by Sam Mendes' use of lighting and\ncolour which is remarkable. Visually, every shot is a work of art, a\nportrait of discomfort. You can really feel the unease as the camera\ntakes you on a journey through the Burnham household, furbished in\nblue-greys and white \u0096 not so much as a fork out of place - mixed with\nthe stark contrast of red roses. In short, an absolutely breath-taking\nfilm, American Beauty is shocking yet humbling, sad yet tranquil and\nultimately beautiful.\n"},
