{"review": "\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a film without any artistic\nintegrity. It was purely made to grab as much cash from its audience as\npossible.

Snow meanwhile wishes to spring a\ntrap to finish off the rebels. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is volatile as\nhe turns his anger towards Katniss. Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) the\nleader of the rebels who plans to usurp Snow as President has her own\nagenda. You could say she has two sides to the coin.<br><br>Some of the action is humdrum and poorly lit and Katniss's use of the\nbow and arrow is almost laughable in this film. Given the first film in\nthis franchise was a decent film, it has been disappointing to see the\ndecline in quality to the sequels.\n"},

{"review": "\nMy main concern before seeing this movie was whether splitting the\nfinal instalment into two movies would actually work or whether it was\njust a monetary decision.

Not only are they emotionally\nunsatisfying, but they sometimes feel quite out-of-character and\nunconvincing.<br><br>Having said that, some of the action is terrific (although the trailers\nspoilt most of it).

However, I think it's deeper\nthan that. In \"Mockingjay: Part 2\" there is tons of action (like the\nprevious films) but little else.

Donald Sutherland is\nonce more amazing as the bad guy and the movie gives a very touching\nand beautiful ending to the 2 heroes after all the pain and suffering\nthey've been threw. For me this film was so much better than both\nMockingjay Part 1 and the first Hunger Games and it was as good as\nCatching Fire. You definitely need to see this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nMockingjay Part 2 begins exactly where Part 1 left off. Katniss is\nstill coping with hijacked Peeta and makes the decision to go off into\nthe capitol and assassinate President Snow for herself.<br><br>This chapter is definitely the darkest, yet most intense and scary. It\nshows the audience the consequences of war, yet still remains true to\nthe 'Hunger Games' theme. This being that the Capitol ultimately\nbecomes the arena. Mockingjay Part 2 is without a doubt the most\nemotional of the series as some of the most adored characters are\nkilled off in very very brutal ways. You also get to see Katniss\nstruggling mentally and emotionally, yet being brave and courageous.\nThis is why I believe so many people are inspired by her. Jennifer\nLawrence is absolutely magnificent and really brings out Katniss'\nemotions. I strongly believe that she is the right person to play\nKatniss and I couldn't imagine anybody else playing her.<br><br>Overall, this film is an on edge, intense thrill ride filled with\nemotion, action and tells a story which should inspire a generation.\nThis film gets a 10/10 from me as it ticks all of the boxes that anyone\nwould want to see in a blockbuster to be entertained. The whole Hunger\nGames Franchise is without a doubt the best YA series, and Mockingjay\nPart 2 gives fans a satisfying and thrilling end to a journey which\nshould be remembered for decades.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis last movie had a sweeping scope, emotional impact, and truly\namazing depth. The Hunger Games isn't strictly a Girl vs. Capitol\nadventure, or anti war movie, it really is a tragedy,grim, dark, with\npoignant moments in every one of the four movies. Any who have read the\nbooks shouldn't be surprised by this. The utter cruelty of the Capitol\nis graphically covered, Jennifer's performance captures the sadness and\ndetermination in Katniss, and the pacing of the movie is superb.\nThinking of the great arch of character and story encompassing the 3\nbooks and 4 movies, this forth movie captures the book extremely well\nand is an amazing end to this exceptional series.\n"},

Even at the last\nscene of the film, they did not stop making us feel for the characters.\nEverything felt so real. The cinematography was on point too. The\nending in the book was too abrupt, but it worked great as the final\nmovie scene. Would pay to watch this over and over in cinemas.Perfect\nending to the Hunger Games series.

{"review": "\nSo several years ago I heard about this series and how popular the\nbooks were. I immediately read books one and two (audio booked them\nactually) and really enjoyed both of them. After seeing Jennifer\nLawrence in the first movie, I was so taken with her magnificent\nportrayal of Katniss Everdeen, that I very deliberately decided i would\nnot partake of the final novel in the trilogy, but would instead put\nall of my chips on the last two films. <br><br>All of the first three hunger games movies were very well done and\nquite entertaining. Jennifer Lawrence brought a wonderful authenticity\nto the staring roll and the supporting cast was genuinely entertaining\nand gave top notch performances as well. Which brings us to the final\ninstallment. <br><br>Rare indeed is the story that can cleverly build upon its earlier\nsuccesses. The Matrix couldn't do it, nor could the old Planet of The\nApes franchise or the Jaws films. These series left viewers feeling\nvery disappointed and wistful for what might have been. Happily for\nfans of The Hunger Games series, the final chapter ties the previous\nthree films into an exceptionally satisfying package that really made\nme glad that I had devoted my scarce free time to this film series over\nthe last few years. I will not provide any spoilers to my review,\nsuffice it to say that it unfolds like some unexpectedly beautiful\nflower that will really have you saying \"holy s**t!\" when it is fully\nrevealed. There are absolutely positively NO loose ends by the\nconclusion. That said, I will say that I was truly delighted by the way\nthe story utterly surprised me. I think the last time I was so taken\naback by a plot twist was the movie \"The Sixth Sense.\" So go and see\nthis movie after your Thanksgiving dinner, and you can have two very\nsatisfying experiences!\n"},

There was a girl with curly white hair,\nwho was probably about 4 years old. She stuck out the most in the\nmovie.<br><br>If you want a clear sign of the times, it's this movie. When I grew up,\nit was Harry Potter, and, as you all know, at the time it seemed to\n\"consume\" everything. Kids today themselves are, however, more spoiled\nthan before. I think I am less bratty than most kids my age were/are,\nhowever. I think maybe movies later when we're older and less\nfresh/interested will start to feature especially aesthetic people like\nthe little girl with curly white hair.<br><br>This movie was a lot of work with good results and deserves my 10/10.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis is my first time on IMDb or any other sites similar, simply\nbecause I feel I need to set some things straight. I have no idea why\nthis film has such bad reviews. Having been an avid follower of the\nseries since it began I still went into this movie prepared for the\nworst and ready to be critical if need be (because of the reviews I had\nheard). Start to finish however I don't think I moved once. I genuinely\nthink this is almost the best of the four, beaten only perhaps by the\nfirst for obvious reasons. I thoroughly appreciated the way the\ndirectors have kept the films to the book and Mockingjay PtII was no\nexception. Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely outstanding in this film and\nby all means deserves to be well recognized for her performance. The\nothers also should not be forgotten, Liam Hemsworth really stepped out\nin this film as did many of the other supporting acts. For those\ncomplaining it was slow paced, I am not sure what you wanted. It kept\nme on edge the entire way through and was actually enhanced by the\nmoments of quieter reflection that other \"action\" movies often lack. It\ncontained immense depth, astounding cinematography and visual effects.\nLastly, I think the ending was utterly beautiful. This book, this\nseries, is somber. It's dark, its reflective and it alludes to a number\nof very serious themes. The directors dealt with this incredibly well.\nThe film is a perfect ending to the series, my only disappointment is\nthat it is the last.\n"},

The book\nMockingjay contains details that are important to the end of the story,\nso obviously you need two parts to explain it all.<br><br>It was one of the best Hunger Games movies.

This\nfilm focuses on the war between the districts and the capitol. <br><br>It is very brutal and extremely horrifying (especially during the\nsewers scene), it just gives you a punch in the gut during the\nemotional moments. Nearly half of the squad team are killed including\nFinnick and Castor :( . My two favorite scenes are the sewers scene and\nthe capitol raid scene with the parachute bombings, it was rather\nterrifying to watch the children get blown up and see their bodies but\nFrancis Lawrence structured it very well, pushing the 12A rating to its\nmaximum highest boundaries. The determination and focus of this film is\njust dazzling and very unexpected, Most people say why Mockingjay was\nsplit into two parts, copying harry potter and twilight. In my own\nopinion, it was such a relief they split it, there was so much\ninformation in Mockingjay that you just can't leave it out, every word,\nevery feeling in both films are just terrifying and life-like. This\nfilm is truly the film you need to see. I loved it so much, I would\nwatch it more than 20 times. Highly recommend this film and ignore the\nnegative comments, this film will shock you with every scene. It's just\nastonishing and mind-blowing. Every scene (if you're a big fan) will\nhit you hard until you drop to the floor, crying and regretting.<br><br>I remember when I first watched The Hunger Games, those times were just\nthe best and now we have come to the conclusion after 3 years of\nwaiting and waiting. Same with catching fire and mockingjay part 1, all\nthe films are intense and stimulating.

Not that part 1\nwasn't good or anything, I thought this film was a little better than\n\"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1\" simply because part 1 was just a\nset up for this film. Part 2 was actually better than what I thought it\nwas going to be. This film displayed a great way to end a tetralogy of\nfilms that told the epic story of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence)\nand her fight to kill President Snow (Donald Sutherland).

{"review": "\nGreetings from Lithuania.<br><br>\"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2\" (2015) is probably the weakest\ninstallment in the series. It is not really worth watching in cinema,\nyou can safely do it on a home media. Still, this is not a bad movie by\nany means, it just that it's more or less the same, it doesn't offer\nanything new, it is a repetitive movie, and the conclusion of the saga.<br><br>Acting was OK, nothing special. Special effects were pretty solid,\nalthough there isn't that much of them here. It has couple of nicely\ndone action sequences, but they are far and in between dialogs, which\nwe have heard already before. There isn't anything new this movie can\noffer.<br><br>Overall, \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2\" is a mixed bag/. You\nwill see how the series will end, but it by far not it's strongest\npart. It's just more of the same and not really involving. Not a bad\nmovie, but far from series best.\n"},
{"review": "\nSeems like the movie is ever in search of its identity.

The pace of the movie is wavering at best, at\ntimes interluded with action &amp; adventurism.<br><br>Of course the dependable JL carries the movie.

For context, i really enjoyed the first two movies in the series\n- but this one just lacks any kind of excitement, feeling, or sense of\npurpose. I also hate it when writers use children for cheap pathos -\nthis movie was especially offensive in this regard.\n"},

And as with part 1, the pace of the movie was deadly slow.\nSo disappointing. <br><br>As my daughter said after the movie had finished, it seemed like the\nslow sections of the movie needed to be sped up, and the fast sections\nslowed down. As an example, where Katniss's sister, Primrose gets\nkilled, it was like, she's there, dead, move on. There was no big deal\nmade about it, which I understand was quite a big deal in the book. I\nmight be wrong.<br><br>I'm always sorry to bad mouth any movie, because I know how much effort\ngoes into making them. My philosophy has always been, if a movie\nentertains on any level at all, even it it's unintentional, it is a\ngood movie. IE. I'm not a film critic, I'm a film fan.<br><br>But I'm sorry to say, remembering all opinions are objective, but I\nfound this to be a slow, tedious and wasted opportunity.

Perhaps it's just how Katniss'\npersonality deals with it. She didn't look too emotional when it\nhappened, but we know she'll have her scars for the rest of her life.<br><br>If it had been done differently, the movie might have more favorable\nrating out there, but it would lose the feeling of the book.<br><br>And the book was not an action book, it was a bitter,darker reflection\nof our modern society - which is already in the grasps of manipulative\nMedia Empires.\n"},

{"review": "\nBetween this movie series, and the Divergent movie series, my stuff\ngets a little mixed up. However, both have a recurring theme in book\nform which is that they start extremely strong and finish extremely\npoorly. The first books in each respective series were fantastic. The\nlast books were awful. <br><br>In this particular series, I was unsatisfied with the ending that was\nwritten and for that reason, I was uncertain that I would even bother\nto see this movie. Part 1 was a disaster. It was terrible. I hated it.\nIt made certain that I would not be attending the showing of part 2 in\ntheaters. It didn't help when the cheesy posters for this movie started\nbeing released. <br><br>This week, I was able to see the movie for the first time just to cross\nit off of my list of movies that I must watch someday. The first 30\nminutes started to make me feel like it was going to play out exactly\nas expected: awful. As the movie started to go on, however, I began to\nreally appreciate it. <br><br>The acting in the film was good as a whole, the storyline was well cut\nand didn't leave out anything to significant, and the ending was\nbrilliant. I think that Hunger Games fans will be very satisfied with\nthe last 20 minutes of this movie, unlike the book. Overall, I give it\nan 8 out of 10 which is much better than my expectations were for the\nmovie.\n"},

{"review": "\nSnarky personalities from emotionally indulgent brats speaks to our\nself absorbed millennial natures. These characters have never known the\ndistricts; they have never known hard work or suffering. Their\ncharacters all seem like they were raised in 90's American empire\nsuburbia where their parents told them they were great. Everyone is so\nconcerned about their feelings, forgetting that they are at war. All of\nthe male characters look like they just came from ten hours at the spa.\nA few \"adult\" characters provide a semblance of structure and order,\nbut it seems more like a group of college chaperones with the focus\nquickly diverted back to the emotional concerns of self-obsessed youth. <br><br>The Jennifer as a media tool gets old to the viewer even more than it\nstarts to get old to her character. <br><br>I did like the intrigue of Coin needing to control, and seeing The\nMocking Jay as a threat.

{"review": "\nYou're more likely to enjoy this movie if either a) you are a fan of\nthe book series, or b) you are a mature viewer. By mature I don't\nnecessarily mean that you've attained a minimal age in years (though I\nwould say that it is unlikely viewers younger than 10 would appreciate\nthe movie). I mean you can equally enjoy not only faster-paced action\nsequences but also slower-paced drama. As with the books and previous\nmovies, this last Hunger Games movie has intense moments of both action\nand drama, but also less intense but still dramatically important\nsequences of people just talking. I suspect this is what less mature or\ninterested viewers have called the \"boring\" parts.<br><br>However if you like movies that are dynamic in pace and emotionally\nengaging rather than just one long special effects sequence, and\nespecially if you are a fan of the books, I think you'll appreciate\nseeing this movie in the theater.

{"review": "\nWe live in an age where many producers take advantage of \"eye candy\"\nand will have movies made that has spectacle over story. Think Michael\nBay. This movie has the reverse problem: it's story is cohesive and\nwell written, but it lacks the pay off. I give it a passing grade\nbecause it's problems aren't what it does bad but what it doesn't do.\nOverall, it's a good movie but is the worst of the series due to its\nlacking climax. SPOILERS When watching a second time, I realized, this\nwouldn't be a hard movie to make good. Their first problem is following\nthe promo videos. I admire that they're following the book-I'd be mad\nif they changed it-but that doesn't mean they can't skip it. By this\npoint all the promo stuff and Peeta stuff is irrelevant. A better\nchoice would to focus on a new group of people taking the front of the\nattack. They could explain it as, \"The capitol has guns hidden\nthroughout the city that we need to destroy before flying in jets.\"\nThis would explain the mission and also make for some cool war action.\nAfter, we can come meet up with Katniss. Her squad dies and they\nimmediately go under ground, again, skipping the slow parts. The next\nchange would be when they're going to Snow's house. This would be a\ndeparture from the book but the book's flaw is Katniss' lack of action\nin the plot. To make her relevant again, maybe she heard Peacekeepers\ntalking of a trap so she and Gale need to take them down. It'd be cool\nto see them work as a team and go bad-ass taking down a whole squad.\nTHEN the rebels attack and more mayhem and Prim dies. Lastly, I like\nhow she kills Coin, but this doesn't seem like a reason to not kill\nSnow. She should've gone over to Snow, whispered, \"This doesn't change\nanything,\" and stab him cold heartedly. These three additions wouldn't\nchange the story but would insert much needed climax into an otherwise\nsolid story.\n"},
