{"review": "\n\nThe Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi\naction thriller.  Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly\nintelligent.<br><br>Boy, was I wrong.  Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes,\nthey are awesome.  And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if\nsimilar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained\nas well).<br><br>But the movie has plot as well.  It has characters that I cared about.  From\nKeanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips\nwith his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even\nthe creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters\nmore than just the usual action \"hero that kicks butt\" and \"cannon fodder\"\nroles.  I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the\nvillains with a passion.  It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and\nbehold, a plot does help the fight scenes!  Just try it, if you haven't seen\nthe movie before.  Watch one of the fight scenes.  Then watch the whole\nmovie.  There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the\nscenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together\nis an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the\ntheaters.  Think about it next time you're watching one of the more\nbrainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.<br><br>All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.  If you haven't, you're missing out on\none of the best films of all time.  It isn't just special effects,\nfolks.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nIt's been a while since a movie has generated enough interest in me for me to\nwatch it.  \"The Matrix\" looked exciting enough in the trailers, so I decided\nto give it a look.  What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the\ngreatest special effects I've ever seen.  The camera angles really work for\nthe action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for\nmore.  Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.  He may not deliver the\nbest dialogue, but his look can carry a film.  He was a great choice for the\nrole of Neo.  Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence\nFishburne.  I highly recommend this film for those who are a fan of visually\nstunning movies.  It will blow away your senses...\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThe Wachowski Brothers vision of a possible future takes the visual and\nsound aspects of filmmaking to a new high. Incorporating older still\nphotography with computer enhancement to the degree that appears on the\nscreen has raised the genre to a level that will be very hard-pressed by\nfilmmakers for a number of years. Acting was wonderful, script, visual,\nsound, everything about this film is a tribute to a usually overlooked\ngenre.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThe Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a\nbrilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is\nexcellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu\nis A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly\ninspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this\nmovie!<br><br>It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the\nend really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of\nsequels\non the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for\nit.<br><br>Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many\ndifferent levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new...\nthis isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read\na\nnumber of definitive works (Simulation &amp; Simulcra was one I believe) in\nmodern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects\nof\nthe major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not\never.<br><br>I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to\nwatch on a good cinema system, too.\n"},
{"review": "\n<br><br>Who is to say what is real or not? We are defined by our view of reality,\nno matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people.\n*evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher\nwhether or not your view is the reality we all share.<br><br>The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special\neffects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning\nto the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a\nmilestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody\ncan appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science\nfiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it\nwith\nawesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking\nmovie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we\nall need in our lives every now and then.<br><br>With that, I leave you with the fact that I've seen more different types of\npeople liking this one film than most other films to date. Move over George\nLucas, you may have just met your match... :)\n"},
{"review": "\nIn the year 1999, \"The Matrix\" and \"Fight Club\" were undoubtedly the\nbest films of the year. The Matrix was truly revolutionary in special\neffects, specifically in CGI (Computer-Generated-Imaging) technology.\nThe still cameras that were used to capture multiple angles of a single\nshot, in bullet-time technology, was a creative new approach. The film\nis initially suspenseful with people not knowing quite what was\nhappening until Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) reveals that Neo's (Keanu\nReeves) reality was actually a fabricated world that is an elaborate\nsimulation created by machines. Neo and the majority of the world's\ninhabitants have been stuck in simply a mental simulation prison. <br><br>The magnitude of philosophy in sync with special effects make \"The\nMatrix\" a one-of-a-kind movie masterpiece. College classes show this\nmovie in their philosophy class, and at the same time can prove to be\none of the best special effects movies ever. Supplementally, \"The\nMatrix\" also provides endless action and a pretty solid storyline that\ninfluences the philosophical ideas in the movie. <br><br>There are so many great things in this movie, it is just crazy.<br><br>The color palette along with the time and effort put into stunts also\naccelerates this movie on all filming levels. \"The Matrix\" leaves the\nviewer a sense of pride in the world he/she can live in to just know\nthat people are capable of creating at this level. Unfortunately,\nmonetary and timing motives offset the potential quality of the\nsequels. \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\" were just a\nwaste of time and weren't carefully thought out, as was the first\nMatrix. <br><br>10/10\n"},
{"review": "\n\nYou walk into this film not knowing what the Matrix is. You take your seat\nand watch the trailers. The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark\ncomes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers\ngrand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema,\nknowing what the Matrix is.<br><br>This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The\nWachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects\nsequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?<br><br>The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first\nkung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half\nwith slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the\ngovernment lobby scene?<br><br>Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving\nis perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.<br><br>You may notice in this review that I have not revealed what the Matrix is.\nLike the trailer says, 'You have to see it for yourself.'<br><br>Excellent. Best film of '99. 9/10. \n"},
{"review": "\n\nRight there with Seven and Silence of the Lambs for me.  I love this film,\nand rate it a notch above some of the other great action films of our time\n(i.e., Terminator, Predator) because it has a really well thought out\n(although moderately unbelievable) story line.  A lot of thought provoking\nmaterial, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't\nusually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. \nEnjoy!\n"},
{"review": "\nI think there were Action/Sci-Fi movies before The Matrix and there are\naction/sci-fi movies after The Matrix. It changed everything. <br><br>This movie was one of it's kind when it came and there was nothing like\nthis seen before. Awesome action sequences, bullet times, slow motions\nand the concept, everything was awesome.<br><br>Not just action, the movie is great in other aspects too. The movie is\nthought provoking and very influential. This movie forced every\nfilmmaker of action/sci-fi movies to step up.<br><br>I still remember when i watched this movie for the very first time more\nthan 10 years ago, it felt like i'm in a different world. I've never\never seen anything like this. Movie had awesome effects, that might\nseems outdated these days, but that time it was first time something\nlike that was shown in movies.<br><br>This movie was really a gamechanger, and we are lucky that this movie\nactually happened.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat made The Matrix special was the ground breaking visual effects\nsuch as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and\nvideo games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park.<br><br>Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and\nsecret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government\nagents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is\ncontacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.) <br><br>Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality\nthat controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel\nagainst the machines creating the false reality.<br><br>The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial\narts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.<br><br>Keanu Reeves is in his element is a world where he does not understand\nthe world around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts\nsequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of\nJohnny Mnemonic.<br><br>Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this\nhostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Ann Moss is\nkick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman\npowers.<br><br>The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to\nthing about the world around us and our existence within it.<br><br>The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit\nto po faced. However the Wachowski's did manage to catch lightning in a\nbottle which they did not manage to do with the sequels.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is literally the reason I do what I do. the special effects\nwere so amazing for it to be a 99 film, the fighting was beyond well\nchoreographed and the story!!? don't even get me started, do you know\nhow many times I had to watch this movie!? it took years for me to\nunderstand it all.I couldn't thank the director enough for this film\nthis movie inspired me to begin doing things that were extraordinary\nand that stood out. my passion for parkour, riding Motorcycles, to my\nmartial arts. now I just wanna become an actor and be great, do my own\nstunts, and not be a nobody. Neo (Keanu Reeves)was my idol, and I hope\none day I can be as great as he was in this film!!\n"},
{"review": "\nI find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only\nattracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on\nwhich this movie was based.<br><br>People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than\nthey did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who\nwill win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people\nthey make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war\nwith machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano\ntechnology. The latter technology offers something like the software\nwhich teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they\nwill be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster\nthan our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a\nway that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under\nsuch speed.<br><br>As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of\nPsychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I\nreckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward\nless and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars\nwhich have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in\ndifferent directions.<br><br>Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects\nalongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way\nand I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Matrix (1999) is basically the idea of The Matrix, an ultra-\ncomputerized sci-fi film by Andy and Larry Wachowski that has an\nexcellent concept but squanders it by falling back on the same old\ntired action movie conventions. The Wachowski siblings have given us an\nhour's worth of excellent cinema, filled with fascinating ideas. <br><br>The film begins where We start with a woman named Trinity (Carrie- Anne\nMoss), who seems to be on the run from a gang of Men In Black- types\nled by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). Luckily, she can leap tall buildings\nin a single bound, run around on the walls, and so on. So she gets\naway, but not before contacting a computer hacker named Neo (Reeves) by\nsending him a cryptic message on his monitor. Following her directions,\nNeo meets up with Morpheus (Fishburne), who is in charge of a ragtag\nteam of humans from the late 22nd century. And why did Morpheus seek\nout Neo and bring him up to speed? Because Neo is The One; he's the\nmessiah. He's going to save us all.\n"},

{"review": "\nThe Matrix is an action packed, special effects driven master piece\nthat is sure to catch the attention of any futuristic film critic.\nSeveral chase scenes utilize cross-cutting techniques to establish\naction occurring in two different locations. As I watch this film, I am\nreminded of two films from memory -Enter the Dragon (1973) and Stand by\nMe (1986). Both films reiterate the theme from Matrix, struggle with\nchoice and the consequences of those actions. Spoiler Alert: Neo,\nplayed by Keanu Reeves, is a software writer who struggles to find his\nplace in the world and as a result turns to computer hacking to escape\nhis mundane life. At the party Neo is approached by Trinity, played by\nCarrie-Anne Moss. Trinity is driven by her love for Neo and her\nunwavering loyalty to Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn). Imaginative\nMise-en-scene is created during the first scene between Neo and\nMorpheus. Morpheus can be considered a profit; he predicts the coming\nof \"the one who will save Zion.\" Morpheus offers Neo a life altering\nproposition-a choice between taking a red pill (which reveals the truth\nof the Matrix) or the blue pill (which will doom him to the old life\nwhich Neo struggles to escape from). Neo's adversaries are a group of\nthree steely faced agents simply known as \"The Smiths.\" The Smiths are\nagent programs who keep order within the Matrix by dispatching their\nown form of law and order. Throughout the film as Neo, Morpheus, and\nTrinity battle the Smiths, Neo subconsciously begins to believe in\nhimself and the power he holds inside. By the final show-down, Neo has\nmiraculously developed a skill to stop bullets. In each situation he\ndiscovers that the path he wants has been laid in front of his feet\nlike a red carpet.

CA., CALI, COLOMBIA.....and ORLANDO, FL <br><br>The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of film\nmaking for the new millennium! 20 or 30 years in the future, a plethora\nof both historical and imaginary virtual world venues available at your\nfingertips, via your virtual reality headgear, you won't be asking\nyourself, once immersed in the world of your choosing, \"Wait, how did I\nget here and why am I here?\" <br><br>MATRIX illustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan's\nassertion \"The Medium is the Message\" has proved to be! Does Matrix\nglorify violence? Is it really original? Does it border on blasphemous?\nMost of the discussion and critique of MATRIX really seem to miss the\npoint entirely. MATRIX is the essence and epitome of style...not\nsubstance.<br><br>Through a seamless symbiotic blending of diverse visual and auditory\nelements, most notably the 360\u00ba sequential surround photography of\nartfully choreographed and precisely executed human action scenes, the\nWachowski's have achieved a true re-definition of the cinematic\nexperience, on their own terms.<br><br>Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with their signature\nstyle, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world much more\nconvincing than any drug-induced one. MATRIX clearly speaks to us in a\nnewly formatted cinematic language. My recommendation: Put aside any\nnegative preconceived notions and just listen....<br><br>10* STARS*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! <br><br>Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Espa\u00f1ol, are\nmost welcome!\n"},

It's kind of like the story\nin many religions where one person is the savior and that there's an\noracle telling the person how to be this. Just like in the Matrix where\nthere's an oracle setting Neo on the path to become The One.

Unbelieveable to be sure, but it is incredibly\noriginal story wise, as it sprawls into something every average movie goer\ncan appreciate- hard boiled, visually and bloody packed action, gore and\nviolence.<br><br>The best part though is that this film breaks many boundaries in\ntechnology\nand (with it's 4 Oscars for editing, sound, sound editing and visual\neffects) and deserves every bit of credit it gets.

{"review": "\nA large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special\neffects and action-packed scenes.

This is very\nmuch like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which\neverything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things\nreally are (objective reality). <br><br>Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something\nreal and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering.

With his stunning effects\nand a mind blowing story-telling, story-structure and bad-ass\ncharacters this movie is still one of the best movies in the world.\nJust the confrontation with philosophical questions of our life and the\n\"fantasy of science-fiction\" makes this movie to one of the must-seen\nfilms in history. I don't think that Matrix just got his success with\nthe really cool presentation, more important the mix of the really well\ntold story, character development and environment complexity gives the\nmovie the required plus to be a 10 Star movie.

{"review": "\nthe best movies of all,But the movie has plot as well. It has\ncharacters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal\nof Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to\nLawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents,\neveryone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just\nthe usual action \"hero that kicks butt\" and \"cannon fodder\" roles. I\ncared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains\nwith a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and\nbehold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't\nseen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the\nwhole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of\nthe scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put\ntogether is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come\nto the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the\nmore brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen this movie first appeared in the theater I watched it without\nexpecting that I would become so addicted to it. Since then I must have\nwatched it over a hundred times. Why? Well because I couldn't\nunderstand it at first, so it took me 2-3 times just to understand what\nis going on. Not that I'm stupid or something, but every time I watched\nthe movie with a different perspective in mind and \"a different pair of\neyes\". This is one of those rare movies that makes you want to watch it\nagain so you can see the beginning one more time and confirm the theory\nthat you concluded in the end of the movie.<br><br>The casting crew is great, although I don't know what will it have come\nout if Will Smith played the main character. The visual effects are\ngroundbreaking for the 20th century and have set a standard for the CGI\ngenerations to come. Great story line, maybe one of the best futuristic\nstory since... IDK... Star Wars, probably inspired by a bunch of\nJapanese anime/manga like Ghost in a Shell. That whole recipe mixed\nwith great sounds/music makes an all time best!\n"},
{"review": "\n\"The Matrix\" is a visually dazzling cyberadventure, full of kinetic\nexcitement. <br><br>I've seen dozens if not hundreds of these exercises in violence, which\nrecycle the same tired ideas: Bad guys fire thousands of rounds, but\nare unable to hit the good guy. Then it's down to the final showdown\nbetween good and evil--a martial arts battle in which the good guy gets\npounded until he's almost dead, before he finds the inner will to fight\nback. Been there, seen that; however this one is an exception, as it\ndone very well.<br><br>Still, I must not ignore the movie's virtues. It's great-looking, both\nin its design and in the kinetic energy that powers it. It uses\nflawlessly integrated special effects and animation to visualize\nregions of cyberspace. It creates fearsome creatures, including\nmechanical octopi. It morphs bodies with the abandon of \"Terminator\nII.\" It uses f/x to allow Neo and Trinity to run horizontally on walls,\nand hang in the air long enough to deliver karate kicks. It has leaps\nthrough space, thrilling sequences involving fights on rooftops,\nhelicopter rescues and battles over mind control.<br><br>And it has performances that find the right notes. Keanu Reeves goes\nfor the impassive Harrison Ford approach, \"acting\" as little as\npossible. I suppose that's the right idea. Laurence Fishburne finds a\nbalance between action hero and Zen master. Carrie-Anne Moss, as\nTrinity, has a sensational title sequence, before the movie recalls\nthat she's a woman and shuttles her into support mode. Hugo Weaving, as\nthe chief Agent, uses a flat, menacing tone that reminded me of Tommy\nLee Jones in passive-aggressive overdrive. There's a well-acted scene\ninvolving Gloria Foster as the Oracle, who like all Oracles is\nmaddeningly enigmatic.<br><br>\"The Matrix\" did not bore me. It interested me so much, indeed, that I\nwanted to be challenged even more. I wanted it to follow its material\nto audacious conclusions, to arrive not simply at victory, but at\nrevelation.\n"},

If you like fighting, shooting, philosophical\nquestions, awesomeness, slow-mo, then this is the movie for you. Neo\nflying at the end was a bit to much but i guess it fits with him being\nable to conquer the world that once controlled him. the part where NEO\nenters Agent smith, that part was a bit puzzling for me, I didn't\nunderstand why he would have to do that. Neo needed a new body? he came\nback to life. what was the purpose of he going in to SMITH? I'm sure\nNeo didn't know he was going to destroy SMITH by going into his body.\nor else he would've done the same to the other agents that were in\nfront of him. Then again, he was in a hurry to save Trinity and\nMorpheus. Oh that's right he was, instead of running to his right to\nget the phone which he had enough time to do. He goes stands there,\nstops the bullets, runs into SMITH... Trinity and Morpheus hold on...\nscares the other agents away, then he runs back to the phone. i guess\nwhat I'm trying to say is that the ending could have been better and\nmore rewarding. Neo is basically immortal in the Matrix, his heart\nstopped, nope, come back to life he says. Smith tried to control him,\nnope, denied he says. If Neo can defy physics by flying, by stopping\nbullets in mid air, and coming back to life. why not use that power to\nstop SMITH in the first place, he stopped bullets, what is he using to\nstopped them. couldn't he use the same power for other stuff or does it\nonly apply to bullets? If Neo had never gone inside Smith, smith\nwouldn't had multiplied. I guess Smith was needed to move the plot\nforward for the next two movies. eventually ending the war between man\nand machine that went on hundreds of years with a lame truce.\n"},

{"review": "\nWhen the Wachowskis released \"The Matrix\" in 1999, it marked the dawn\nof a new age for the science fiction and action genres with the\nnumerous technical and aesthetic innovations it contributed to the film\nindustry.

At\nthe time, few could have anticipated that such an edgy, high concept,\nand quasi-religious film would achieve the blockbuster success in which\nit did. Most assuredly technological advances in graphics, such as the\n\"bullet time\" technique developed specifically for the film, and an\ninnovated aesthetic to the complexity of choreographed fight sequences,\nare factors contributing to its earned acclaim. However, one of the\nmost critical elements, which has and will continue to contribute to\nthe film's success, was the innovative postmodern hybrid score that Don\nDavis wrote for the film. Davis made unique orchestration decisions\nthat were foreign to the popular trends in scoring at the time, and he\nconstructed textural motives instead of themes to portray concepts\npertaining to the film as opposed to the more traditional approach of\ncreating thematically driven material designed to quite often score the\ncharacters.

It was\na movie that started a new trilogy of Sci-Fi. \"The Matrix\" is a movie\nin which you will be stunned, it's a really nice movie with a\nwell-known cast of actors.<br><br>The movie show us a hacker who learns from mysterious rebels the truth\nabout the real life and the fake one. It also show us the two sides of\nwar. From one hand is the rebels and on the other hand is the\ncontrollers of them.<br><br>The well-known cast plays an important role on how we see this movie\nbecause of theirs interpretations. Keanu Reeves as Neo made an\noutstanding performance, such as Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus and\nCarrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith (the bad guy)\nmade an also good performance.<br><br>\"The Matrix\" for more people is the upgraded version of a movie in\nwhich Keanu Reeves played a few years before, this movie is \"Johnny\nMnemonic\" (1995) and the leading actor is who else than Keanu Reeves.\n"},
{"review": "\nAs of writing this review, I have seen this like a 1000 times between\nthe ages of 12 to 26. I have seen another 1000 movies in the same time\nframe but The Matrix has a charm and attraction attached to it like\nnone other. Its sleek, stylish and so much substance. This is one movie\nthat makes a compelling case against people who argue that only books\nhave depths, because this movie describes its story, characters and\nevents in a manner that mere words cannot capture.<br><br>This is my first review on IMDb.com and I am a sort of computer geek\nand I am being biased and this is my ultimate movie. But when I say I,\nI am confident that I describe the sentiments of a generation that has\ngrown up under the influence of this movie.<br><br>That should say it all, but among the many fine qualities of this\nmasterpiece, two stand out for me. One, The Matrix is no doubt the\nfinest computer based science fiction there is, the concept is clearly\none of the most imaginative and vivid and detailed piece of genius, and\nit presents a parallel reality, the possibility of which cannot be\ncompletely denied, and its theories on machine and AI development still\nmake sense after 14 years of its release. Secondly, this movie is slick\nand fast paced, layered with actions sequences that set a precedent\nboth in terms of the creativity and technology with which they were\nshot, but their emotional, spiritual and existence in the story itself.<br><br>If you are reading this review after watching the movie (as I often do)\nthen all I have to say is watch it again, there is more there then what\nyou have already seen.Enjoy!!\n"},
{"review": "\nI cannot get enough of this movie. I have seen this movie more than any\nother movie, and I cannot get sick of it. It has everything I need to\nkeep coming back. This movie is on a whole other level when it comes to\nsci-fi. It is so well done, so smart, so stylish and everything any\nsci-fi or computer nerd wishes would happen to them. It's\nanti-establishment and really feeds into how the government and\ncorporations are trying to bring humanity down in a way that is so\npoetic and amazing. I love love love love love this movie! The acting\nis perfect, the storyline is flawless, the graphics are insane, the\nplot is believable, and you just want to live in their world with them.\nCannot say anything bad about this movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI finally saw this one, and I'm glad I did. Some people didn't like the\nacting, but I thought it was fine. The storyline seems to get in the\nway of the action at first, but if you take the time to watch this 3 or\n4 times, the storyline ADDS a lot to the film and shows you that the\nawesome gun-flashing scenes had a reason to them.<br><br>Agent Smith was cool, the kung-fu action scenes were cool, the guns\nwere cool, and the special effects were great. I don't want to\ndisappoint anybody by giving them high expectations before they saw the\nmovie, but this is a great movie. How can you resist the idea of being\nable to download ANYTHING you want to learn in an instant? 10 years of\nkung-fu experience downloaded into your brain in 7 seconds! The idea is\nas seductive as time travel, which made Back To The Future so popular.\nSee this!!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nthe matrix brings action to the big screen that was never seen before\nwith intense fights scenes,a well thought out story line with a hint of\nlove that keeps you wanting more.the story follows Mr. Anderson who\nworks a regular 9-5 job by day but by night Neo (hacker name) makes\nextra cash by being a computer hacker and selling computer programs.His\nlife takes a dramatic turn when finds out the life he's been living is\na lie and actually he's a slave to a world overran by machines,Its kind\nof ironic that he hacks computer programs but is a slave to a computer\nprogram made by machines. its a well thought plot that deserves a 8 out\nten stars its worth watching then putting the sequel in for an encore.\n"},
{"review": "\nMany people had related it to different concepts. Some to spiritual,\nfictional world and some to the actual world. I am one of those who\nbelieve we may be in Matrix. The concept is more about the will, belief\nand determination on oneself. <br><br>Now, about the movie, its the most entertaining, action filled with\nsuperb stunts and well fitting characters. Unlike many other movies of\nthe same genre, the concept is not very hyperbole but realistic in the\npresented situations. If you do not like the movie in first go, it\ncould mean you do not like sci-fi, action, thriller or like me...did\nnot understand the concept. Well...watch it again. After you get a\ncomplete grip, like me after my 3rd run...i watched it like more than\n10 times and every time i watch a better print and i love watching it.<br><br>10/10 movie!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nWhat if virtual reality wasn't just for fun, but was being used to\nimprison you? That's the dilemma that faces mild-mannered computer\njockey Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) in The Matrix. It's the year\n1999, and Anderson (hacker alias: Neo) works in a cubicle, manning a\ncomputer and doing a little hacking on the side. It's through this\nlatter activity that Thomas makes the acquaintance of Morpheus\n(Laurence Fishburne), who has some interesting news for Mr. Anderson --\nnone of what's going on<br><br>In THE MATRIX, Keanu Reeves stars as Neo, a computer programmer with a\nsideline as a hacker, who gets mysterious messages that lead him to\nMorpheus (Laurence Fishburne), leader of a ragtag group that lives\naboard a rocket-style craft. It turns out that it's not 1999 but about\n100 years into the future. All of humanity has been turned into a\nsource of energy to keep machines \"alive.\" The Matrix is a massive\ncomputer program that has the humans believing that they are still\nliving in a world that has actually been destroyed. Special agents, led\nby Smith (Hugo Weaving), seek out Morpheus and his followers to destroy\nthem.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Matrix has an intense, well-thought-out plot that leaves you\nwanting more. The acting is believable and sincere, and Keanu Reeves\nsuits his role as the main character perfectly. The visual effects are\nbrilliant and all the stunts are executed without any fault. Watching\nthis movie, I could not believe that it was released in 1999 - the\neffects and camera-work are so good that they would fit in with the\nmovies being released now, 14 years later. I recommend this movie to\nanyone who loves action or interesting story lines with an exciting\ntwist. This movie deserves its place in the top 250. I give it a nine\nout of ten. Go watch it right now if you haven't yet (and if you have -\ngo watch it again!).\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Matrix is one of the best films of all time, as well as the best\nsci-fi movie ever made and also one of my favorites of all time! The\nMatrix is one of those movies like Usual Suspects which holds you from\nthe opening credits and does not let up til the lights come on in the\ntheater. By now we all know the story behind the Matrix and how great\nthe special effects and action was, but I noticed that most people\nforgot to mention the depth of the story.<br><br>Yes! Matrix is an action movie, but it is also Biblical in many ways.\nNeo is Jesus... he is the \"one\" selected to free the people from\npersecution. Cypher is the disciple who betrayed Christ... he sold out\nMorpheous for materialistic items and was then was forever banished\nfrom the real world. Morpheous is God... the all knowing, he is\neverywhere, yet nowhere. And Trinity is the Virgin Mary, for it was her\nefforts which brought Neo to the \"real world\". Other references include\nZion,the Nebucanezhar and the Oracle.<br><br>I have seen this film three times, will see it again at the theaters\nand I am definitely going to purchase the DVD on Oct. 5. Forget Phantom\nMenace, the Matrix is IT!\n"},
{"review": "\nThe matrix should be the \"BEST movie of all time\" If you don't agree,\nis because you don't understand the movie :) The Matrix has all topics:\nCyberpunk, the Mind, The reality, The Control, All about Software,\nvirus, hackers. I ask you: Why Seraph has YELLOW code in matrix ? Do\nyou understand why? Think it.It's one between hundreds of reflections\nand questions around matrix. If you see The Matrix several times, you\ncan see incredibles references to others movies and authors. Like\nCyberpunk movie is incredible the mention to others ideas that we 've\nseen in Ghost in The Shell, Level 13, Existez, etc. You can complement\nthat movie with the game \"Enter the Matrix\" and the Animatrixs movies.\n"},
