{"review": "\nLet me say it right now; I hated this movie. It was bad. Look, the\nconcept of a being movie cut into two parts just does not work. The\nwhole thing felt like a two-hour exposition. The first 30 minutes were\nso damn boring I literally could not stop getting out of focus and move\nuncomfortably in my seat. There really isn't anything special going on\nas it progresses, too. There is war going on, but they do not really\nshow it and it doesn't suck you in. It's very slow paced with lots of\nteenage drama and not a lot of \"games\" or \"hunger\" as in the previous\nfilms (which I liked, by the way). And now there's Jennifer Lawrence's\nacting, which was trying too hard (while making lots of weird facial\nexpressions that made me laugh at inappropriate moments). Overall, I\nthink the idea of splitting a movie into two parts; thus making the\nfirst half boring, isn't a very good one. And in this particular movie\n\"not very good\" is a compliment. 3/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI had never heard the term \"set-up movie\" before today. There has\ndefinitely been a trend of splitting up a story into multiple movies.\nThese movies don't have a beginning-middle-end the same way other\nmovies do but at the very least there's some progress. <br><br>The problem with the Mockingjay Pt 1 is not that it's boring or poorly\nmade. In fact, there is a lot of excitement in this movie. The problem\nis that from beginning to end there is hardly anything that changes. If\nyou look at where the characters are in the beginning and where they\nare in the end there isn't much that's changed except for what happens\nin the very end. Katniss has been doing things but we haven't seen much\nof the effects of her actions.<br><br>I didn't dislike this movie that much despite it's slow beginning. I\njust can't give this my seal of approval when I left the theater\nfeeling like I saw half a movie. By the time the story gets its payoff\nmy memory of this movie will be worn-off.\n"},
{"review": "\nLike watching paint dry. Boring to a mind-numbing degree. How many\ntimes can we see Katniss be horrified and/or emotionally distraught?\nMaybe the filmmakers thought they were adding depth to their\ncharacters. Well, they were wrong. Instead we, the audience, sit\nthrough one scene after another in which really nothing happens at all.\nThis whole thing could have easily been compressed down to 40 minutes\nand then we could have had the rest of the book as the rest of the\nfilm. This felt very much like they were stretching it out so they\ncould make two movies - which is the new thing to do in Hollywood with\nthese franchises. Not good storytelling.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am so disappointed of the movie. And that's because there happens\nclose to nothing. At nearly every point you notice it's stretched for\nmaking out of one book two movies. At the beginning I liked it, because\nmany parts of the book found their way into the movie. But I realised\ntransferring the story of a book 1:1 into a movie isn't that good.<br><br>(NO SPOILER) As an example they need about 5-10 minutes just to go down\na staircase, back upwards because \"missing\" something and down again.\nAnd nothing really happens. All the time absolutely no excitement rose\nin me and I just got bored. And I am pretty sure this should be a part\nwhere your heartbeat is meant to been rising.<br><br>Sure there are some nice and decent scenes but most of the stuff is\njust lame. In the book it works but clearly not in the Movie (plus the\nshowdown of the book is missing because of the split).<br><br>But at least I enjoyed the screenplay of Josh Hutcherson and Philip\nSeymour Hoffman, which lifted the Movie \"up\" to 3 Stars. I hope the\nlast one gets back on the level of the first two movies.\n"},
{"review": "\nGreat acting from the cast; especially Jennifer Lawrence, the\ncharacters were as believable and entertaining as they were in previous\nfilms, this is pretty much the highlight of the film.<br><br>The plot however was dull and uneventful, as in nothing really went\nanywhere. in the majority of the film there was no tension; for the\nmost part it was basically \"stuff happens in a bunker for 2 hours: The\nMovie.\" which is super disappointing because although I haven't read\nthe books; I'm told by people that have that they skipped a bunch of\nthe action and downplayed the apparent love triangle.<br><br>If you wanted an action packed flick like the first two or you are the\ntype of fan who doesn't like stuff in the book to be left out, you will\nbe sorely disappointed as this is clearly a filler movie to get some\nextra $$$ before the series ends.<br><br>wait for DVD.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was extremely dull and boring. You could probably skip\nwatching this movie in the series and you wouldn't miss much. The story\nwas dragged out so much that I found myself shifting in my seat and\njust waiting for it to end.<br><br>The acting was especially bad and I was cringing at the amount of\nclich\u00e9 lines. My friends and I were also really surprised by such a\nlack of chemistry between Katniss and Peta; their relationship is so\nforced and I had difficultly even caring about the characters because\nthey are so underdeveloped. So many scenes were completely unnecessary;\nthey added nothing to the story and were just there to take up time.\nMockingjay was extremely disappointing even though I went in with low\nexpectations. 2/10, would not recommend.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe first movie was fresh and entertaining. I've been dragged by my\npartner to watch the second one which I actually enjoyed until the end\nwhen I realized it was not finished yet. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay\nPart 1 is simply a jock. I've never been so much bored from a movie and\nat some point I really considered leaving the theater. The pace is\nslow, the acting terribly poor and every single scene predictable.\nJennifer Lawrence's character has been stretched to the maximum. All\nshe does is crying and pretending all movie long.I will not watch the\npart 2 in theater nor on TV as we all already know what will happen.\nThis movie is perfect if you want to feel frustrated, disappointed and\ntricked.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Huger Games has clearly grown up in Mockingjay. Social criticism is\nmuch stronger than previous movies. Films theme is much more brooding\nand ominous than before. But that doesn't save this picture totally.\nDividing the movie in two parts is clearly a huge mistake. Many scene\nare way too long and some of them are clearly just vain. Topmost\nfeeling is just making more money. It would be much better to make only\none movie instead of two. One three hour long movie is much easier to\nkeep together, than two over length movies. It is clearly Hollywood's\ngreed to capitalize on movie (and book) series fans. How many times\nmore the audience will accept that? Jennifer Lawrece is great at her\nrole as Katniss, but somehow Josh Hutcherson as Peeta's role as\nbrainwashed puppet doesn't convince. There is a lot of good elements in\nthis movie so it is a shame that Hollywood want just get few more money\nfrom the fans. Mockingjay part 1 is despite that quite eligible movie\nthat end up in green money making. Good movie ends up to mediocre\naction flick and that is shame.\n"},
{"review": "\nI liked the Mockingjay movie, and saw some (on message boards and blogs\nand sh!t) mention Battle Royale 2: Requiem. I believe \"Ripped off\" was\nthe words used. Hitherto, I had not known there was a sequel to the\ngreat Battle Royale movie, so I got around to watching BR2 today, and\nI'm rather convicned they're pretty much identical movies. They both\nfeature the kids forced to kill each other, in a controlled\nenvironment, that go on to take part in a revolution, but before that,\nthere is all the stuff about Noriko's brainwashing and the propaganda\nwar, even the road full of skeletons looked like it was taken from the\nsame storyboard. Battle Royale 2 seemed to be about control of a\npopulation through violent entertainment, exactly like Mockingjay. But\nwhy did they leave off the ending? Note that BR2 had not captivated\naudiences as did BR1. <br><br>So, while I really liked Battle Royale 2, I only kinda liked\nMockingjay. I'm sure others will have their own preference.\n"},
{"review": "\nLiterally, each and every character, most of the action scenes, and\ndialogs in the film are inspired, or say blatantly copied from the\nJapanese Battle Royale II film.. You name a character, you got him in\nthis film. Even the background score is lifted from BR and BR2. And the\nworst part is that this plagiarism didn't pay off in the end. The\nscreenplay was very poor. Action sequences looked too much fabricated,\nsuper slow, and lacked depth. It's a congery of B-grade visual effects,\nmelodrama, and toothless humor.<br><br>Final word: If you're are an eleven year old with no Hollywood\nexperience, it's a treat for you.

I have to say I found Jennifer Lawrence's acting to be\nparticularly terrible and emotionless in this film. <br><br>Skip the theater on this one, just wait for part 2 to come out and\nwatch them together, or just watch the first 5 minutes of part 1 and\nthen fast forward to the end because nothing happens in the middle\nanyways.\n"},

Two and a half hours of Lawrence whimpering (Like the\nleader of a rebellion should?) I'd rather watch Two and a Half Men.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe 2 is for some of the sets. The rest of the film could just barely\nreceive a 1 if I was feeling seriously generous or off my head on coke.\nI suppose that would be a great way to watch this dribble. Made for the\nmindless moron teenagers of America and they got what they deserved.\nWhat a load of total hogwash and bad acting to boot. Lawrence is\npainfully stressing us with her over the top attempts to show pain and\nsolidarity with the poor and downtrodden. Total FAIL! She is just not a\ngreat actress. That is is all one can say. The plot or story or\nwhatever this is, is pathetic and Sutherland is a wasted talent here\nand even he is finding it difficult to portray his role. Someone like\nthe director may have to be blamed for this mess. Anyway, who cares is\nultimately the big question. This stuff should never have been made.\nFor those of you who actually liked this film I suggest a visit to your\nshrink or better yet go out and get seriously plastered and then watch\nit again and maybe you will see how awful this garbage really is.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was very slow and draw out...not as good as the others. It\ntook forever to explain what they were doing and to get to anything of\nexcitement/the action in this movie.<br><br>If this movie had been the 1st hunger games, the entire series would be\nin trouble. With the success of the previous movies, maybe this one had\njust too much to live up to &amp; that didn't happen.<br><br>Nothing about this movie will leave you talking or craving the next\none. Katniss made her name from her survival skills, the movie made us\nyearn more because of the action and neither of these surfaced for the\n1st hour or 2 of this movie.<br><br>Slow and Disappointing. Their plan of setting up a plot for future\nmovies was fine, however they didn't have to make this one so boring to\ndo so.\n"},
{"review": "\n....or not. After 2 movies you would think the main character has\nevolved. Well, she didn't. Constant whining and uselessness push the\nspectator away to the point that you don't care about Katniss. You\nactually get tired of her.<br><br>Spoiler - <br><br>And to top it of, the scene with the cat during the\nevacuation...*facepalm* Why would the director try to add to the\nclich\u00e9s we can already see elsewhere ?! Why did the director think that\n2 parts were necessary after the first 2 movies ?<br><br>This movie dragged on and on, letting the viewer suffer 2hours\nof...nothing...\n"},
{"review": "\nNo more tough struggles to survive, complicated interpersonal\nrelationships and difficult decisions for loved ones; just hurt, anger\nand worry over and over again. No more flamboyant capital, gloomy\ndistricts and brutal jungles; just repetitious ruins, same underground\nshelter, and similar propaganda commercials boring enough to doze off.\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is basically a two-hour trailer for\nthe final movie which advances almost nothing critical. I have to say\nit's the biggest disappointment in film series and I really don't want\nto score it. <br><br>The idea of splitting the final story of a film series into two parts\ndefinitely spoils the film. I see nothing beneficial other than\neconomic gain. The bland plot limits performances of actors and\nactresses. I can only wish to see more Josh Hutcherson in the next\nfilm.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a great example of a Hollywood budget that was utterly wasted.\nThe reason you go to a movie like this is not to have the pivotal\naction scenes left up to the imagination. The acting is atrocious. It\nseems to be making fun of itself at times, which is just sad. Is it SNL\nor is it a 15 dollar per ticket Hollywood feature?<br><br>It's odd because this movie cost 125 million dollars and yet it has all\nthe special effects of a made for TV movie...<br><br>I just finished watching \"Maze Runner\" which was surprisingly good for\nwhat it was, and I was shocked to find out that it only had a $34\nmillion budget. Honestly, there was 2-3 times the action and excitement\nin Maze Runner vs Mockingjay. <br><br>I like Hunger Games for a lot of reasons but this movie just dropped\nthe ball big time, it is boring, it adds nothing of real note to the\nstory, and it makes the actors in it look bad.\n"},
{"review": "\nI would like to review this film. In my opinion, it does not deserve\nany review, because the plot is awful, sometimes it feels you watch\ndifferent films at the same time. Acting is bad; especially the main\nrole actress does the 'credit'. I will admit that previous parts\nentertained me to some extent, but this one not only disappointed me.\nIt made me so angry, that I wanted to complain to OFCOM. The trailer\nshowed completely different film. 2.5 hours of boring talking about\nnothing with poor acting! Not a single person on this planet deserves\nthat punishment.<br><br>THE WORST FILM OF THIS DECADE EASILY!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!\n"},
{"review": "\nI went to this movie with my friend and well, it was absolute dog crap.\nthe sound effects were bad. It was too predictable. And too much use of\nPeeta being an insane douche. I would literally go and destroy the main\ncopy of this crap. That's how much I hated it. Now District 13 is\nunderground, I thought I was watching a more hi-tech version of the\nhobbits house! BOO! BOO YOU DIRECTOR OF THIS CRAP! Why can't you see\nthat you have just made a p!$$ take of a futuristic war movie and added\nmore propaganda for war and people who need f******g help! For Pete's\nsake, don't make part 2, it will be the worst, most s*****t movie ever!\nPlease! For the love of god, don't go and see it and don't go see part\n2! The only good hunger games is the first!\n"},

You see the proof in the horrible reviews\nof this travesty and the endless comparisons against the superior,\nBattle Royale.<br><br>Stop paying Hollywood for their trash.

{"review": "\nI am not going to go into details. I will try to keep it short. <br><br>It was as expected, a totally dull movie. <br><br>Looks like it was made for a TV release.<br><br>I can understand that it is a formula movie, where the producers and\ndirectors are cashing on the market for certain type of viewers that\nare really suckers for these Teenage, rebellion, Ohh I am so special,\nwill do things on my own terms type stuff. <br><br>But it was sad to see that they didn't even bothered to make some\neffort and make it more interesting and viewable. <br><br>Saw the whole movie in like 30 min and was still bored to death.<br><br>Good going guys, cant wait to see the next garbage(actual word removed)\nsequel of this franchise.\n"},
{"review": "\nI can tell that really I was so excited about this film getting me\nwatched it on the first day of its showing with my family who are also\na big fan of this movie series. Hmm, but despite of the great acting of\nthe actors, (I do love Jennifer Lawrence), the delivery of the script,\nscenes that are effective/captivating and with good story flow.. I\ndon't know, I'm still bit disappointed that I'm actually waiting for\nsomething that I know the the first 2 movie installations have in it. I\nknow that with some parts I'm still thrilled and amazed but I was\nreally expecting something that really don't happened or i guess\nsomething that I wanted to happen that doesn't then took place. With\nall the lines of the actors, it then become more of a drama than of\nhaving an action-packed film that made me thrilled and hooked with it\nin the first place. But still, I'm gonna watch Mockingjay: Part-2 just\nnot thinking of this Part-1 that kinda made me bit disappointed. Hoping\nthat the 2nd one will have all my expectations that I know will\novercome what then happened with this 1st one.\n"},
{"review": "\nI see there is no point of repeating the bragging on movies that are\ncut into two parts, so here's the quick opinion: I agree with the\nreviews written before me and and as so I have nothing more to\ncontribute to my own review, the movie is boring and it makes me angry\nthat developers profit from the viewership. <br><br>But I assure you to worry no more as it is obvious that people are fast\non disliking this 'cutting into parts' trend and as a result most movie\nmakers will abandon this foolish affair to pursue not viewers'\nimpression but money.<br><br>Just keep rebelling in your reviews and/or comments. Sparkle the\nrevolution! Become the Mockingjay of film industry!\n"},
{"review": "\nthis is the Stupidest movie ever conceived There was nothing to watch.\nI don't know how you can sell a movie by doing some close up shots of\nJennifer Lawrence in leather tights. It was just plain stupidity in\nevery scene. Same old revenge drama with half side shaved heads, war\ntorn buildings and desperate attempts to sell its viewers the idea that\nits a master class. At least should have shown some respect to the book\nfrom which its taken. This movie should be shown at some fashion shows\nduring couture week may be it can get some applause there. The movie\nwas so boring that gradually the whole theater started booing and and\nwalking out of there shaking their heads.i need my money back !!!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nWhy did this have to be two parts? I know it makes people more money,\nbut this would have been a better movie if it was all one piece. There\nis very little action and lots of political propaganda stuff and that\nisn't a bad thing, it's just that it ends so anticlimactically, making\nthe whole movie feel forced and unnecessary. When I left this movie, I\nhad the same opinion I had about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\nPart 1. Just when things are about to go down for real, the credits\nroll, which is really disappointing. If you wait and watch this\ndirectly before Part 2, I imagine you'll enjoy it, but for now, I can't\nreally say it was all that great.\n"},
{"review": "\nI don't know where to start. Being a fan of this franchisee i had so\nmany expectations but the movie is so slow that even if you go out and\ngrab a cup of coffee you will come back to see that the movie has not\ngone anywhere. I admire Jennifer Lawrence but this is probably her\nweakest performance till date. She has sounded screechy and devoid of\nemotions for most parts which is a surprise considering what a fine\nactress she is.The movie is unbelievably stretched out that it gets to\nridiculous proportions as you start praying for the movie to end.<br><br>The Mockingjay should have been a one part movie but as we all know for\ncommercial interests a 45 minutes plot has been dragged out for two\npainful hours. Only Jennifer Lawrence has hogged the lion share of\nscreen time while other actors like Woody Harrelson are criminally\nwasted. The direction lack vision. The editing is probably the weakest\npart of the movie. The story of the movie can be told in 5 lines and\nthey have made a two hours movie out of this. The high rating for this\nmovie is surprising to see.\n"},
{"review": "\nI still don't understand that. Most of the people i know loves this\nmovie saying this is the best movie ever.<br><br>Let's start. I think dividing a movie in two parts is pretty much the\nway to kill a movie, I think that maybe whatever happens in the second\npart could have completed this. now it has no real conclusion. No\naction at all, sometimes the dumbest solution ever (katniss' sister\nrunning for the cat during the bombing). Still like slow movies, but\nthis truly doesn't have any true event happening until second part of\nthe movie. Like the post-apoc. atmosphere though, that \"stalker\" effect\ngiven by bombing sites, but that's the only reason i rated this 5/10.\n"},
{"review": "\nI liked the first film (8/10), thought the second film was very average\n(6/10) and this is a generous 5/10.<br><br>There's no point going into detail but suffice to say that everything\nhere is very weak indeed and I felt sorry for the great Jenny Lawrence\ntrying her best with this appalling non-script that persists in\nsuggesting that her character could have any feelings towards the\npipsqueak Peter character .<br><br>It's just not a believable romantic thread ...<br><br>Jenny and Julianne could both find better work than this. <br><br>Very poor indeed ...\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst off, let me say that the first two movies in the series were very\nwell done. However, I was disappointed to find 'The Hunger Games:\nMockingjay - Part 1' to be shallow and weak. <br><br>If you want to see the movie for the action, don't. There are very few\n'heart-pounding' action scenes. But I get it, the book series matures\ninto a larger statement about oppressive governments and the concept of\nfreedom itself. That said, the movie was neither political nor\nphilosophical. A good example of a stellar film in this category is 'V\nfor Vendetta.' <br><br>The greatest disadvantage this film wrought was its insistence to focus\non Peeta's personal struggle. It was hard to sympathize with Peeta's\nproblems because the film dragged it along for so long. In the end, the\nmovie was boring and sluggish. It was neither romantic, political,\nphilosophical, nor a simple action film. It was a dull combination of\nall of these.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe first two instalments were nice to watch and made me curious about\nthe sequel. They totally lost me with this one.

The only action is revealed\nand actually seen in the official trailer.<br><br>The characters are totally ruined and Katniss in spite of her previous\nacts of sacrifice, becomes very selfish, ready to let the whole nation\nbleed for her own feeling of satisfaction. The new characters are not\nproperly developed and some old ones have rather random appearance,\nmaking the plot a set of mostly random and unimportant acts and\nmoments.<br><br>The young adult previously fighting for her life (and the lives of\nothers) and prepared to kill now becomes a teenager totally lost in her\nlittle sorrows and feelings. Again and again and again until the film\nis over.<br><br>I had some expectation after the first two instalments and this felt\nlike a let-down.\n"},
{"review": "\nWow, this movie was boring. The first two installment was a alright\nwatch, but this one was boring from start to finish. The constant\nbickering of politics, setting traps and becoming a icon of hope. Was\nso generic and boring to sit through, mainly because of the lack of\ndepth and originality. This third installment really didn't need to\nparts, but it seemed like they really wanted to milk this installment\nfor all it's got. Despite it not having enough good materials to do so.\nIt's like the movie dragged on as long as it can, despite the lack of\nammunition to carry on.

{"review": "\nBefore watching this I viewed Catching Fire again in order to compare\nit to Pt.1. Pt.1 stalled in many scenes while Catching Fire progressed\nsmoothly.

Why were we supposed to care about the leading\nand supporting characters? Johanna Mason has more charisma than anyone\nelse except Haymitch. Both characters deserve better. The others looked\nlike they were walking through their lines. They acted like they didn't\ncare and who could blame them? The humour and snappy dialogue was gone.\nWho the heck was I supposed to root for? With apathy like that no\nwonder why \"Haymitch\" was desperate for a drink?
