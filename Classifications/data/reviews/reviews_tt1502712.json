{"review": "\nThis movie was awful. As a comic book fan I felt like Josh Trank just\nslapped me in the face by using so very little of the actual comics. He\nbasically used the name of a comic I love to get me to see it and then\ngave me a different movie. The casting was awful (none of the\ncharacters matched their comic counter part. They were all too young so\nof course Reed Richards didn't have gray streaks, who thought it would\nbe a good idea to make a tiny guy the Thing?, and was it really\nnecessary to make the Storm family have a \"modern home\"? That's more of\na story that would fit in the X-Men), the origins dragged on for too\nlong, and their origin wasn't even the same! The Fantastic 4 is\nsupposed to be all about space travel not going to other dimensions.\nThat's Dr. Strange's territory. I walked out of this garbage and got my\nmoney back.\n"},
{"review": "\nTerrible movie as previous reviewer writes the pacing is all wrong the\ncharacters are bleh you don't feel any attachment to them with them\ncreating no chemistry.The middle section of the movie is drawn out\nwhile the climax feels rushed like the director went gosh where running\nout of time quick rap it up. After the recent awesome avenger movies\nand the Thors this felt like some hacked together 1990s offering.The\nstory has so many gaps in it with supposedly super smart scientist\ndoing super stupid things and Miles Teller playing Mr Fantastic is just\na terrible choice he has no screen presence as a leader. Wait for DVD\nor what ever and let it go quietly in to the past .\n"},
{"review": "\nJust because it's based on Marvel comics doesn't mean it's made by\nMarvel Studios. It's made by FOX, which licensed the rights to the FF\ncharacters from Marvel years ago. Thus, any comparisons to other MCU\nfilms such as the recent Ant-Man are totally meaningless. And that is\nwhy it's such a mess. Marvel had no control over what FOX did with\ntheir source material.<br><br>For those not aware, this film was plagued by problems from the start.\nThe director was all but banned from the set and editing room in the\nfinal stage of production, after which a good deal of the footage was\ndumped and re-shot. In the end, it was slapped together by one of the\nproducers and a temporary director, and the results show: there is a\ndisconnect between the first two acts and the third. It's almost like\nthere are two separate movies trying to co-exist, and it doesn't work.\n"},
{"review": "\nSorry but this movie misses the mark big time. Compared to the 2005\nMovie which was perfect, this one is just really bad.<br><br>The story is OK but not executed well. The characters are not as\nportrayed in Marvel. Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, why? Political\ncorrectness gone mad. Johnny Storm was not a black man.<br><br>Kate Mara compared to Jessica Alba? Well there is no comparison really.\nAnd Ben Grimm is really just some overdone cgi, nothing compared to\nMichael Chiklis brilliant portrayal in the earlier movies.<br><br>The biggest question about this movie for me is why? Why was it made\nwhen the 2005 version got it so right?\n"},

{"review": "\nI'll be concise: this FANTASTIC FOUR reboot is a waste of your time. It\nis not a bad film, so much as a pointless one. The acting is adequate.\nThe script is terrible. There is not a trace of wit or reality to any\nof the dialogue. Characterisation is two-dimensional at best. The\neffects are, in comparison to other films of this type, poor. There is\na story, but no plot. The final 'showdown' with Dr Doom takes place in\nthe last 5 minutes. To describe it as perfunctory is to be kind. Only\nsee this film if you have an 'unlimited' cinema pass for one of the\nchains - please don't spend money on it. At the special Cineworld\npreview, everyone sat through the credits waiting for an extra scene.\nNope, nothing. \"That was a load of sh*t!\" exclaimed someone in the\nsuddenly silent auditorium. Oh yes.\n"},

It becomes utterly, depressingly and horrifically dark from\nthere as Doom who they thought died comes back and kills a bunch of\npeople. The ending and battle with Doom was so rushed, it felt like the\ndirector forgot he couldn't make the movie three hours long.

The lines and\nwriting in the movie was very groan inducing, I couldn't believe some\nof the cheesy quips the characters had. The build up for the end comes\nout of nowhere. While the final confrontation was easily the best part\nof the movie, it took way too long to see the characters use their\npowers, and it was rushed, the best part lasted what seemed like only 5\nminutes. The movie itself feels like standing in line for a roller\ncoaster that was only 20ft long. It's not worth your time, nor are you\nmissing anything if you decide not to see it.
