{"review": "\nBased on the reviews I read in here, I was expecting much more from\nthis movie. Yes the movie is action packed, but very much over done.\nCertainly not a quality movie by any means, with a weak story line. It\nwas like being in an action game where the lead had unlimited\nlives....he is invincible no matter how many times he is shot! There\nare assumptions that we will understand the rules of the \"committee\",\nbut these are never explained and we are left with very few answers the\nend. In light of the over the top and often excessive violence and\nkillings, I must say Keanu Reeves' performance is the only highlight of\nthe film. Overall however, a very weak story with unnecessary and\nexcessive violence, and a plot that is more suited for a PlayStation\ngame.\n"},

{"review": "\nInteresting action movie. What i really liked about it is that lack or\nnormal exaggerations in the movie continuity. John does NOT shoot 100\nbullets from a handgun without reloading, he does NOT fight for 20\nminutes with the bad guy at the end and he does NOT have superhuman\npowers (like flying through windows, dodge bullets or fall from 50\nmeters without repercussions). Yes, it's a bit brutal (90% of the guys\nget shot in the head), but it's exactly what i would expect in real\nlife if a person like Wick would really exist and would go rogue.\nBesides that, some clich\u00e9s, some cars miraculously exploding (i think\nthe only thing which was really amateurish made in the script) and the\nnormal lack of story in a bang-bang-shoot-don't-look movie. But, at\nleast Wick goes after the bad guys for killing his dog, not the woman\nhe loved (like in most of the others). <br><br>Overall, 9/10 to watch, 4/10 to watch again.\n"},
{"review": "\nShitty movie. Honestly, after the first 20 minutes, I had to turn if\noff. Really? Killing a dog? Was that necessary? Also, it hurt my ears\nto hear the TERRIBLE Russian being spoken by the \"bad dudes\", and the\nguys who play the gang members aren't even Russian for god sakes. And\nas a Russian, I gotta say I am also incredibly sick of Hollywood\nliterally ALWAYS using Russians as the \"bad guys\". Change it up for\nonce. Keanu Reeves has played the same character- even if different\nmovies- for the last several years. Blah blah, revenge, ex-hit-man,\nblah blah, good guy versus bad guys, blah blah blah.

This one is it. But if it dose not happen. Its sure to be\na singular cult classic. Especially with its refusal to be a shoot em\nup style of show, but a shoot em in the face style of show.

He is\na karate expert and is also skilled with a variety of knives and\nfirearms which are quite useful to our hero. His background is sketchy\nand never really explained but one must just suspend belief and just\ntake the ride as if on a roller coaster. Willem Defoe shows up to fill\nout a decent cast with Reaves carrying most of the load, as he is in\nalmost every scene. It looks good and the New York locations are a good\nchoice.

Why didn't he kill Ms Perkins? What was the\nsignificance of the gold coins, or was I too uninterested to catch what\nit was. Also Willem Dafoe was just a pointless addition, could have put\nanyone in that part who just wanted to collect a cheque for little\ncontribution.

Keanu kept his face and\nbody almost perfect, so he is still handsome and fit, good enough for\nthe film like this. But the enemies have less impression.

{"review": "\nYep, this is a good action film, kind of simple, but good. The action\nin this film is enough to keep action movie fans happy. It didn't have\nlong boring scenes that would have you sitting around waiting for some\naction to start. It was perfectly done, much like \"Predator\" or \"The\nEqualizer\" or, better yet, \"The Matrix\". In fact, while watching this\nfilm I was reminded of the \"Matrix\" a time or two. No mystery why. The\nacting was done well too. There were a few familiar faces from the\nsmall screen(HBO) as well. All of the characters were convincing and\nbelievable. John Wick(Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who is forced to\ncome back to work to find the people who took everything from him. Like\nI said, it's simple but it's good. Now it is violent but it is fun to\nwatch and it will keep you interested.\n"},
{"review": "\nHow can this movie rate 7+ in IMDb ? I registered today for another\nreason but I also wanted to rate John Wick. Sorry Sorry Sorry this\nmovie is not good at all. Very bad acting, no good scenario, no good\nlight. Stupid Russian racism (mafia in US is mostly Jewish); So I\nconsider this movie as a gross propaganda like anti Russian Equalizer\nmovie. USA is a fascist empire \" controlled at 80% by Zionists \"\n(statement by the prime minister of Israel Bibi in 2013). Economy is\ndown because ultra liberalism has allowed the most vicious and\nunethical Jewish mafia to rule the world. Now they want people to fight\nand forget who put the world into chaos so they bring war between west\nand east, Russia and Muslims. Its the fight of bad against good.

{"review": "\nI'm a big fan of action movies and especially Keanu Reeves. He often\ngets crap over his acting skills (or lack thereof). I think hes well\nsuited to action movies, where a lot of the time story is told through\nthe action sequences and a bit more nuanced. <br><br>It's hard to find fault with this movie, and I've seen it at least 3-4\ntimes. All the actors supporting or main do a great job. There is a lot\nof action in this movie, and the movie does start out a bit slow, but\nthen picks up very quickly. <br><br>The action, gun fu and stunts are awesome, some of the best I've seen\nin a long time. You can tell they really practiced and tweaked the\nstunts a lot. <br><br>There are often long action segments with a brief intermission of\nstory, which is how I like most of my movies. <br><br>The soundtrack is amazing as well, with Marilyn Manson contributing to\nthe main theme of the movie and the composer for the movie doing a\ngreat job. <br><br>I would have liked to see William Dafoe's character expanded on some\nmore but that may come in the second movie (in flashback sequences).\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Good: This movie is non-stop action! The storyline is explained\nwithin the first twenty minutes of the movie, the rest of it just\nunfolds into nonstop action. You will find yourself rooting and\ncheering for John Wick (Keanu Reeves) to kick more butt. It is finally\nso good to see Mr. Reeves doing his thing once again. He is a superb\nactor and certainly delivers in this action film.<br><br>The Bad (this comment is a spoiler): The only bad thing I have to say\nabout this film is the scenes involving his dog dying, although this\nwas an important factor in his unresolved grief.<br><br>The Ugly: The movie has a lot of violent scenes so if you are unable to\nwatch movies with a lot of killing and bloodshed, then this movie is\nnot for you. The other action scenes cover primarily a mixture of\nmartial arts, fist fights, and a few car chases.<br><br>Overall, I rated this movie a 10 for nonstop action, great acting, and\nfor the love of seeing Keanu Reeves in a great movie once again.\n"},
{"review": "\nKeanu Reeves plays the Liam Neeson role in this slick, sharp, vicious\nlittle bout of revenge fantasy. With support work from a whole mess of\n\"I know that guys\" and a blow-away effects budget, it's a real riot to\nwatch, not to mention one hell of a tech demo for the masterminds\nbehind the fight scenes. Like those Neeson kill-em-alls, though, it's\nas straight as an arrow and shallower than the kiddie pool. In some\nways, it's refreshing to just dispense with all the stereotypical\norigin trappings and get right into the firefights, but at the end of\nthe show it just feels like one long, easy excuse to watch a whole mess\nof cool stuff without any extra justification. Lust-worthy cars,\nferocious weaponry, powerful western-styled physicality,\nstereo-thumping tunes, magnificent cityscapes, the list just goes on\nand on. Escapists delight, for John Wick has come to deliver a dream.\nCinephiles, well\u0085 just sit back and try to let the sheer, celebratory\nbrutality beat your conscience into submission. It won't be too\ndifficult.\n"},

{"review": "\nWell this isn't Reeve's worst film. It's probably somewhere in the\nmiddle. It reminds me a lot of those mindless 80s action films that\nwere led by Silvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris.<br><br>The plot is simple. No problem. This is an action film and there's\nplenty of it. Think 80s action films but with more gore and intensity.\nIt all looks pretty too. <br><br>This is supposed to be a fun movie. I get it. But it would've been nice\nto see more realistic gun fights that showed John Wick's using his\nentire repertoire of skills to take out dozens of armed gunmen instead\nof just showing his incredible quickness and ridiculous gun shooting\naccuracy. <br><br>I'm not sure how this film got rated above a 7. The film looks pretty\nbut the script is awful and the characters are uninteresting. If you\nwant to watch an action film that's been recently released and are\nsimilar to this I suggest watching either Shooter or Olympus Has\nFallen. These films are just as violent but are more interesting to\nwatch.\n"},
{"review": "\nI bet it would be a great movie but unfortunately I pressed stop after\na couple of minutes. The first scene was about John Wick who loses his\nwife and he is sad and angry. Second scene his dead wife sends him a\npresent which was a puppy for him to take care and love (how sweet and\nsad). Third scene some creepy guys break into his home cause earlier\nthey wanted to buy his car but John did not sale it to them. So because\nthe movie wasn't so tragic and dramatic all ready you probably thought\nthat something was missing. What about killing the puppy? Of course you\nkilled the puppy and you made the movie worth watching now (or not). To\nsum up, a wife dies, he is depressed, violent guys want to kill him for\nhis car and because there is not enough drama already they kill the\npuppy. What a start! I wonder if after that John Wick becomes Hit Man\nand tries to get revenge for his puppy's death driving his car!! Thank\nyou and sorry\n"},
{"review": "\nhad high hopes for this film after seeing good reviews,but it was\nreally bad.

Maybe next time ill scroll down the page\nto read a few more reviews rather than the headline rating.The penny\ndropped when the credits started to roll and i saw that most of the\ndirection and producers were from Russia so it was made for the Russian\nmarket .

The acting is wooden,\nthe scenes unbelievable and this just a payday for those involved.\nTrust me, you've seen it all before. If you're willing to put all\ncommon sense behind you and take everything at face value then perhaps\nthis film is for you.

It isn't as adrenaline filled entertainment\nlike \"The Raid\" or has a super well blended and enticing story mixed\nwith action like \"The Raid 2\" but it'st still a pretty cool movie.

{"review": "\nThe theft of his car and the killing of his dog provide the motivation\nfor an orgy of shootings and beatings.

{"review": "\nJohn Wick is easily Keanu''s best film since the original (and only\ngood film in the franchise) matrix.

The bad guys get no sympathy as carnage\nensues and Reeves is great as the relentlessly cold killer. This film\nis the taken sequel that has never happened! Nyqvist gets to play a\nheartless bad guy and mafioso style boss who's son is the primary goal\nof Wick's revenge. I disagree with those who say there is no story to\nthis film (some of the same people liked speed which is, and always has\nbeen, simply awful!) and I think the characters are reasonably well\nthought out and the acting good for a film of this genre. Overall, a\nvery entertaining action thriller.\n"},

The atmosphere is good and gives\nthe feeling of a city that is governed by a crime syndicate. Acting is\nquite good compared to other recent action movies I saw lately.

The same\nman who had no feelings over the dog had no feelings expressed when his\nbest buddy got killed. Are viewers supposed to root for such a spoiled\nrich boy.
