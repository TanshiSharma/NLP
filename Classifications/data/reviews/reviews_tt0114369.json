{"review": "\nRarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling \r\natmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a \r\nthriller because of that.\r\n\r\n\"Se7en\" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right \r\nfrom the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and \r\nmysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's \r\nvery depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the \r\nmeaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting, \r\nor better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer \r\nHoward Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced \r\nand takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some \r\nobvious clich\u00e9's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and \r\nBrad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different \r\nin many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them \r\nsuch a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play \r\nmore than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey \r\ntruly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and \r\nchilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of \r\nthem put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive. \r\nFurther more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police \r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nThe movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying \r\nscene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the \r\nmost sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it \r\naren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some \r\nscene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the \r\nlibrary scene.\r\n\r\nDark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the \r\nending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.\r\n\r\n10/10\r\n\r\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie is from start to finish a well produced and directed film.  The\nperformances in this movie are outstanding. Brad Pitt, once again, makes\nhis\nrole a stand-out performance by putting his versatile acting skills into\nhis\ninterpretation of Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is well-cast. His\nbrooding acting style fits the character (Detective William Somerset) like\na\nglove, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives her best performance EVER in the role of\nBrad Pitt's supportive wife/lover (Tracy Mills). And of course, Kevin\nSpacey\nwho plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.<br><br>The movie is suspenseful and in parts very exciting.  There is a\n\"Pseudo-Noir\" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the\ncontent of the film (Serial Killing). It has it's philosophical moments\nthat\nanyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate.\nIt makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the\nviewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film\ncoffee/drinks\ngathering.<br><br>Andrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly\nSins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes.  As a writer, I\nreally could appreciate the depth that he goes into with these ideas. The\nmovie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet\nnot bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy.  In this respect,\nthe\nfilm doesn't \"preach\" any special meaning even though the film's moral\nstatements are still maintained.  This film can be enjoyed on so many\nlevels\nand I really enjoyed the third act. One of the best pieces of storytelling\nand scriptwriting ever.<br><br>Outstanding performances from everyone involved (And yes, of course, David\nFincher does a wonderful job) Say no more. *****<br><br>\n"},
{"review": "\n\nDavid Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thriller\nSeven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sort\nHitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) and\nscalding intelligence.  With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the\noverly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful \"I'm taking you\noff the case!\" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in\nlogic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed\nwithout ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its\nviewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination\nand abject fear.  Despite attempts by studio executives to alter Andrew\nKevin Walker's ending, the filmmaking team prevailed and audiences\nexperienced that rare treat of mainstream cinema: an uncompromising\nvision.\n"},
{"review": "\nA stand out film dealing with a particularly unpleasant Serial Killer,\n\"Se7en\" (along with \"Silence of the Lambs\"), is something of a\nmilestone in this genre. An intelligent script, and admirable actors\nincluding the excellent Morgan Freeman, Prad Pitt, Gwenth Paltrow and\nKevin Spacey, with a cinema noir style, and very grisly murders\nrepresenting the Seven Deadly Sins. It is the performances however that\nlifts this movie above the average, Morgan Freeman as the older world\nwise detective, Pitt almost manic as his young enthusiastic sidekick,\nPoltrow plays the wife with a fine degree of sensitivity, and Spacey\ndoes his usual brilliant psycho routine. There is a pivotal scene with\nFreeman and Paltrow in a caf\u00e9 which shows the depth of performances\nhere. They are believable characters in a dark disturbing world wherein\nit always seems to be raining. An effective thriller with tight\ndirection and atmospheric photography.\n"},
{"review": "\nDespite clich\u00e9s, and a very depressing finale, this is one of the\nbest-made films of its era and genre.<br><br>The strengths of the film include an odd relationship between the two\nlead cops, who seem loosely based on the two lead cops of the \"Lethal\nWeapon\" series, but who (thankfully) never play for laughs, and never\nreally become \"buddies\" - the young cop is too arrogant, and the older\ncop has too much experience, which the young cop refuses to\nacknowledge. The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan\nFreeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).<br><br>There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that\nI had learned to \"expect the unexpected\" from the film, which meant\nthat the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply\ndecide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected\nmove instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale\nitself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.<br><br>Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the\nhigh quality of the film-making twists the film into an\nedge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the\none cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.<br><br>I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt\nsomething fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it\ndelivers its promised suspense all the way.\n"},

We still see it copied in movies and TV-series today.\nEverything is great about this film. I guess if anything, the weakest\nlink in the film is Pitt, who is grossly overshadowed by Freeman. But\nlet's not look for flaws when there really aren't any. The script is\nintelligent and uncompromising.

{"review": "\nThis is one of those dark movies, where it's constantly raining and wet\nand where the light always seems to be dim. Appropriately enough, this\nchanges to bright and shimmering heat in the very end. As a kid, I\nhated dark movies. But perhaps it is appropriate in this case, because\nSeven attempts to be a statement about humanity: no one is without sin.<br><br>The seven deadly sins are gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy,\nand wrath. Prime examples of people committing these are being punished\none by one, brutally and efficiently, by a psychopathic killer.\nDetectives, and reluctant partners, William Somerset (Morgan Freeman)\nand David Mills (Brad Pitt) are assigned to track down the killer.\nNeedless to say, the job gets accomplished. While some might argue it\nis done surprisingly, I'd argue otherwise.<br><br>For once, I wasn't impressed with Pitt's acting. I thought Freeman did\na great job. As usual, the villain, John Doe played by Kevin Spacey,\nprovides a chilling performance, even though he is not given as much\ncenter stage as, say, Anthony Hopkins was in Silence of the Lambs. In\nfact, the whole movie seems to hurry through without giving key\ncharacters enough time to build up their emotional worth, particularly\nMills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow).<br><br>In the end, Seven does manage to get its point across effectively.\nWhile watching the movie itself, I thought it a bit anti-climatic, but\nwhen mulling it over later, the images echo very strongly in my mind.\nOne of the most disturbing films I've seen.\n"},
{"review": "\nI love psychological thrillers and this is one of the best I've seen.\nMorgan Freeman was elegant and convincing as a burnt out cop who wanted\nto retire but found the fascination of the job tough to let go of.

(Except to wonder why his name doesn't appear in the opening\ncredits - I looked three times.) And Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife was\nas fresh and charming as ever.

{"review": "\nAt first, I was a little hesitant about taking time out of my life to\nsee Seven. I mean, I am a busy person... but this film was well worth\nmy time... Perhaps the best Brad Pitt film that I have seen, this film\ninvolves two detectives (Pitt and Freeman) going after a delusional\nkiller (Kevin Spacey) who murders his victims according to the seven\ndeadly sins: gluttony, greed, lust, etc... Spacey takes pride in his\nkillings and leaves clues for the police, similar to \"Son of Sam\"\nkiller David Berkowitz when he murdered six women in New York City in\nthe 1970's (\"Summer of Sam\"= another great film)...

{"review": "\n\nSpoilers herein.<br><br>What a great boon these DVDs are! -- where we get to view and review with\ncomments from the creators.<br><br>Sometimes the creative artist is a poor authority for the depth of their own\nart. So it is with some interest that I check if what I have seen was what\nthe director thought he put there. Often, I find them simply working on\nintuition. But the better performing artists are different. They must always\nintend -- if they do not intend a specific feel or effect then it simply is\nnot there. That's why when a DVD commentary involves an actor it is of\nparticular interest.<br><br>In this DVD, we hear Pitt, who really commits to delivering, who worries,\nwho prepares, who sublimates self in order to create an image of himself in\nyour mind. And we hear Freeman who is arrogant, demanding of you and not of\nhim, offering a here-I-am take-it-or-leave-it style of acting, which he\ncalls `intuitive.' This really explains a lot for me. It's why Freeman is a\nnegative attractor for any film I consider, and Pitt the other way\naround.<br><br>Either way, Spacey is the only one that connects with his character, and\nhe's given a relatively simple job. <br><br>I admit that this story moved well, engaging by shock and unexpected moves\nwhen I first saw it.

{"review": "\nThis is an outstanding movie. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are\npitch-perfect, and Brad Pitt is solid. Pitt actually had a lot to do\nwith this movie's success outside of his acting. He forced the studio\nto keep the original ending, and he forced them to shell out the money\nto get Spacey. It is fortunate that he did, as those two elements are\ncentral to the movie's greatness. Spacey played the killer so\nchillingly that it makes his message seem all the more unnerving and,\nperhaps, correct. The uncompromising ending leaves the viewer shocked\nand reeling. This movie could not have worked without it. Outside of\nthose obvious elements, another key to the film is Freeman's character.\nHis outlook on life is and how it is affected by the murders and by his\nnew partner is a key subplot the film. It brings more weight to the\npicture. Also, David Fincher's dark, dreary direction adds to the film,\nsomewhat similar to the way Ridley Scott's dark vision adds to Blade\nRunner. The constant rain is a nice touch, especially when it\nironically recedes after the killer shows up. I was never a Nine Inch\nNails fan, but their dark brand of music fits this film well, as\nevidenced in the opening credits. Overall, I think this is one of the\ngreat films of all time.

The movie is also remarkable for the fact the cinematic climax\ndoes not provide you any catharsis, it just sets your mind thinking \u0096\nnot in the least about what it takes to craft a script as this and to\nmake a movie as disturbingly poignant as Se7en.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nSeven is a very dark and tough thriller.  Most of the scenes are shot in\ndimly lit and wet places which add a lot to the dark mood of the film. \nAndrew Kevin Walker (8mm) wrote this somewhat brilliant screenplay in which\nBrad Pitt (12 Monkeys, Legends of the Fall) plays a young and cocky\ndetective new at the precinct who gets help from the wise old veteran about\nto retire, played by Morgan Freeman (Hard Rain, The Shawshank Redemption). \nIn their first few days together they discover a few bizzare and gory murder\nvictims which seemed to be done in a certain and planned way.  Soon Freeman\nis convinced that someone is using the seven deadly sins to kill people and\npreach a sermon.  So Pitt and Freeman are off on a man-hunt trying to find\nthis man.  Gwyneth Palthrow (Shakespeare in Love, Emma) plays Pitt's wife in\nthe film.  This is a disturbing film with several graphic post-murder\nscenes, but still a very good film.  Freeman is great as he always is.  Pitt\nwas disappointing, however, giving an average performance at best.  Kevin\nSpacey (The Usual Suspects, L.A.

There is little need to rehash\nthe plot here then but what makes Seven such a good film and one of the\nbest thrillers of the last few decades? 1). Two strong, key\nperformances by Brad Pitt and, in particular, Morgan Freeman as New\nYork police detectives just united as one, Pitt is coming, and the\nother is about to retire. Freeman and Pitt have some chemistry between\nthem and let's face it - Freeman is just plain good at just about any\nrole he assays. Add to this strong supporting work from Paltrow and R.\nLee Ermey and especially Kevein Spacey as the killer. Spacey's voice\nand looks sent chills down my spine each time he was on screen. 2)David\nFincher knows how to direct. This film is gross and really is selling a\nvery seedy product as something more. Fincher makes that happen with\nthe crisp dialog between Freeman and Pitt, the very low lighting\neffects throughout, the quick pacing of the film, and the depth of\ncharacterization that he allows his characters to have. 3) The story is\nwell-conceived, well-written, and just crazy enough to be believable.\nThe film has many scenes which are shocking and designed to be so -\nthey succeed.

The sadistic style in which John Doe disposes of his victims\nhighlights the suspense aspect perfectly. I don't know if there has\nbeen a better selected cast. Brad Pitt as the rookie, cocky detective.\nMorgan Freeman(one of my personal faves) as the veteran. Best of all\nKevin Spacey as the macabre and very twisted John Doe.

{"review": "\nI didn't really hold out much hope for SEVEN . It's a film that's\nalmost 20 years old and one that I frequently miss usually on purpose\nwhen it's shown on television .

I\nalmost believed I was going to be watching a reworking of the Vincent\nPrice camp classic horror movie THEATRE OF BLOOD without the funny bits\nso I went in with very low expectations <br><br>What Fincher has done is construct a thriller that is dialogue driven\nwith a sense of portent dread . It'd be very easy , perhaps too easy ,\nto shock the audience with gore and startle moments . Instead the\ndirector resists this very easy temptation and put the audience in the\nshoes of detectives Somerset and Mills so this is a rare thriller where\nthe audience join up the dots when the detectives do . The film is\ngreatly helped by Morgan Freeman who was probably Hollywood's most\neffective character actor at this point but both amazingly Pitt and\nSpacey hold their own against this acting legend <br><br>In short this is a very good gloomy thriller with very dark\ncinematography and very dark subject matter .

I\nreally thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is\nhis usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief\nappearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that\nunflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he\nanticipates it. The murders are hideous. The camera doesn't show the\nmost gory details (which I appreciated), but they are sold to us\nthrough outside factors.

Second is greed. Yes, lawyers are greedy but that is their\nprofession. In fact, in this very movie, John Doe also gets a lawyer\nwho supports him also knowing that he is a serial killer.

People are swallowed\nup\nand spat out in this world, no one counts. It reminded me very much of an\nAlan Moore graphic novel called 'Watchmen' in which a character called\nRorschach becomes a vigilante to clean the streets of the 'scum'. Spacey's\ncharacter is somewhat like this striving to show people the evil that\nsurrounds them. The irony is that his methods are wholely more evil than\nanything he wishes to illustrate.<br><br>The second is the ending. Never has there been an ending like it to my\nknowledge. It is hard to describe how it makes you feel. There is no way\nhe\ncan lose, you feel cheated whilst still appreciating the cleverness of the\nmanufactured situation.

Morgan\nFreeman is so amazing it's painful.  He takes a cop movie cliche (the soon\nto be retired, embittered cop) and takes it to amazing heights. He allows\nyou to understand his character completely.  A beautiful performance.<br><br>The movie is incredibly dark not only in tone but physically.  Somehow\ncinematographer Darius Khondji manages to take a desert setting in the\nmiddle of the day and make it dark, shadowy and bleak.  The dark look of the\nmovie adds to the overall feel of despair.<br><br>\"Seven\" pretty much gets your attention from the very beginning (introducing\nFreeman's character and Brad Pitt. . .who is really good) and then throws\nyou a pretty disturbed title sequence which makes you kind of twitchy and\nputs you in the proper frame of mind.<br><br>The movie starts off very graphically with the 'gluttony' killing.

The assignment\nof roles in the movie is excellent, and I especially need to emphasize\nBrad Pitt's acting (as in \"Fight Club\") which proved that he is not\njust a beauty figure whose main task is to lure women to cinemas, but\nalso showed that he knows to act! Freeman is excellent in the role of a\nveteran detective - like it was made for him, and Spacey in the role of\nthe killer was, as usual, brilliant and gravely. The atmosphere of the\nfilm is so dark and depressing that the bizarre and terrible murders\nmake it even more stressful.

This is similar for Morgan\nFreeman's cool, calm and collected camera. This turns out to be\nsignificant towards the end of the movie.

The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan\nFreeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).<br><br>There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that\nI had learned to \"expect the unexpected\" from the film, which meant\nthat the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply\ndecide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected\nmove instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale\nitself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.<br><br>Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the\nhigh quality of the film-making twists the film into an\nedge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the\none cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.<br><br>I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt\nsomething fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it\ndelivers its promised suspense all the way.\n"},

As usual, the villain, John Doe played by Kevin Spacey,\nprovides a chilling performance, even though he is not given as much\ncenter stage as, say, Anthony Hopkins was in Silence of the Lambs.

{"review": "\n\nSpoilers herein.<br><br>What a great boon these DVDs are! -- where we get to view and review with\ncomments from the creators.<br><br>Sometimes the creative artist is a poor authority for the depth of their own\nart.

But the better performing artists are different. They must always\nintend -- if they do not intend a specific feel or effect then it simply is\nnot there. That's why when a DVD commentary involves an actor it is of\nparticular interest.<br><br>In this DVD, we hear Pitt, who really commits to delivering, who worries,\nwho prepares, who sublimates self in order to create an image of himself in\nyour mind. And we hear Freeman who is arrogant, demanding of you and not of\nhim, offering a here-I-am take-it-or-leave-it style of acting, which he\ncalls `intuitive.' This really explains a lot for me. It's why Freeman is a\nnegative attractor for any film I consider, and Pitt the other way\naround.<br><br>Either way, Spacey is the only one that connects with his character, and\nhe's given a relatively simple job. <br><br>I admit that this story moved well, engaging by shock and unexpected moves\nwhen I first saw it.

{"review": "\nThis is an outstanding movie. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are\npitch-perfect, and Brad Pitt is solid. Pitt actually had a lot to do\nwith this movie's success outside of his acting. He forced the studio\nto keep the original ending, and he forced them to shell out the money\nto get Spacey. It is fortunate that he did, as those two elements are\ncentral to the movie's greatness. Spacey played the killer so\nchillingly that it makes his message seem all the more unnerving and,\nperhaps, correct. The uncompromising ending leaves the viewer shocked\nand reeling. This movie could not have worked without it. Outside of\nthose obvious elements, another key to the film is Freeman's character.\nHis outlook on life is and how it is affected by the murders and by his\nnew partner is a key subplot the film. It brings more weight to the\npicture. Also, David Fincher's dark, dreary direction adds to the film,\nsomewhat similar to the way Ridley Scott's dark vision adds to Blade\nRunner. The constant rain is a nice touch, especially when it\nironically recedes after the killer shows up. I was never a Nine Inch\nNails fan, but their dark brand of music fits this film well, as\nevidenced in the opening credits. Overall, I think this is one of the\ngreat films of all time.

The killer is the sole obsession with the\ndetectives too and the contrast between Brad Pitt's edginess and Morgan\nFreeman's poise is very well portrayed.

It is a movie that goes well beyond\nthat, making you aware of the morbid possibilities that exist in human\nmind. The movie is also remarkable for the fact the cinematic climax\ndoes not provide you any catharsis, it just sets your mind thinking \u0096\nnot in the least about what it takes to craft a script as this and to\nmake a movie as disturbingly poignant as Se7en.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nSeven is a very dark and tough thriller.  Most of the scenes are shot in\ndimly lit and wet places which add a lot to the dark mood of the film. \nAndrew Kevin Walker (8mm) wrote this somewhat brilliant screenplay in which\nBrad Pitt (12 Monkeys, Legends of the Fall) plays a young and cocky\ndetective new at the precinct who gets help from the wise old veteran about\nto retire, played by Morgan Freeman (Hard Rain, The Shawshank Redemption). \nIn their first few days together they discover a few bizzare and gory murder\nvictims which seemed to be done in a certain and planned way.  Soon Freeman\nis convinced that someone is using the seven deadly sins to kill people and\npreach a sermon.  So Pitt and Freeman are off on a man-hunt trying to find\nthis man.  Gwyneth Palthrow (Shakespeare in Love, Emma) plays Pitt's wife in\nthe film.  This is a disturbing film with several graphic post-murder\nscenes, but still a very good film.  Freeman is great as he always is.  Pitt\nwas disappointing, however, giving an average performance at best.  Kevin\nSpacey (The Usual Suspects, L.A. Confidential) is magnificent in a small,\nbut important role.  The film leads up to an incredible climax which is the\nbest part of the film and makes watching it all very worthwhile.

{"review": "\nIncredibly gritty, very fluid, and most disturbing are all ways that\none might describe David Fincher's Seven, a film, as all of these\nreviews on here will attest to, is about a serial killer-maniac killing\npeople based on the seven deadly sins. There is little need to rehash\nthe plot here then but what makes Seven such a good film and one of the\nbest thrillers of the last few decades? 1). Two strong, key\nperformances by Brad Pitt and, in particular, Morgan Freeman as New\nYork police detectives just united as one, Pitt is coming, and the\nother is about to retire. Freeman and Pitt have some chemistry between\nthem and let's face it - Freeman is just plain good at just about any\nrole he assays. Add to this strong supporting work from Paltrow and R.\nLee Ermey and especially Kevein Spacey as the killer. Spacey's voice\nand looks sent chills down my spine each time he was on screen. 2)David\nFincher knows how to direct. This film is gross and really is selling a\nvery seedy product as something more. Fincher makes that happen with\nthe crisp dialog between Freeman and Pitt, the very low lighting\neffects throughout, the quick pacing of the film, and the depth of\ncharacterization that he allows his characters to have. 3) The story is\nwell-conceived, well-written, and just crazy enough to be believable.\nThe film has many scenes which are shocking and designed to be so -\nthey succeed.

{"review": "\nI didn't really hold out much hope for SEVEN . It's a film that's\nalmost 20 years old and one that I frequently miss usually on purpose\nwhen it's shown on television . I've always thought David Fincher was\npainfully over rated . \" Best director of his generation \" claim many\npeople which is patently untrue if you've seen a film by Danny Boyle or\nDarren Aronfsky or Ang Lee . The premise itself doesn't inspire\noptimism being a couple of mismatched police partners trying to track\ndown a serial killer who is motivated by the seven deadly sins . I\nalmost believed I was going to be watching a reworking of the Vincent\nPrice camp classic horror movie THEATRE OF BLOOD without the funny bits\nso I went in with very low expectations <br><br>What Fincher has done is construct a thriller that is dialogue driven\nwith a sense of portent dread . It'd be very easy , perhaps too easy ,\nto shock the audience with gore and startle moments . Instead the\ndirector resists this very easy temptation and put the audience in the\nshoes of detectives Somerset and Mills so this is a rare thriller where\nthe audience join up the dots when the detectives do . The film is\ngreatly helped by Morgan Freeman who was probably Hollywood's most\neffective character actor at this point but both amazingly Pitt and\nSpacey hold their own against this acting legend <br><br>In short this is a very good gloomy thriller with very dark\ncinematography and very dark subject matter . The fact that there's so\nmuch understatement to it is refreshing and nearly 20 years after it\nfirst hit the big screen it remains director David Fincher's best work\n"},

Both\nare very good but the one who steals it is Kevin Spacey. He may be in\nit for 20 minutes, but his role is extremely memorable.

The\norder\nis this:<br><br>se7en: becomes fi5e<br><br>fi5e: becomes ei8ht<br><br>ei8ht: becomes 2wo<br><br>2wo: becomes 4our<br><br>4our: becomes 1ne who becomes se7en to complete the cycle<br><br>This is the same order that the \"sins\" are mentioned throughout the film.\nIt's basically the same order as above.<br><br>se7en gluttony is mentioned first<br><br>fi5e greed is mentioned second<br><br>ei8ht lust is mentioned.  9ine sloth is mentioned, which is next door to\nei8ht and breaks the cycle in half<br><br>2wo pride is mentioned<br><br>4our envy is mentioned<br><br>1ne wrath is mentioned.<br><br>In both cases The order is 7-5-8-2-4-1.  I was obsessed\nby this fact in 1995 when the film came out because I was studying the\nenneagram at the time.  Obviously, someone needed a life\n:)\n"},
{"review": "\nThroughout history the Bible and its wisdom have been used as an excuse\nfor murder. The director in \"Seven\" cleverly makes use the seven sins\nas Kevin Spacey's Divine permission to commit the biggest biblical sin\nof them all; murder! While Spacey is sacrificing his victims in the\nname of religion and punishing them in graphical behavior for their\nweaknesses; Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt appear as the prophets\ndefending and protecting all that is good by trying to catch him. The\ndirector David Fincher keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch\neach brutal murder appear across the screen and as you watch Freeman\nand Pitt getting closer to their killer. Freeman always appears the\nwiser while Pitt gets more and more engulfed with rage as the killer\ntaunts his pursuers while punishing his victims. We the viewers, are\nfilled with anger and wrath (one of the sins themselves), as we want\nthe killer to be caught but we realize at the end that he wants more\nthan that! At the end the shocking revelation takes over our minds and\nfills us with even greater anger as we want Spacey punished! We also\nwant him dead for his last brutal act! We also want Pitt to kill him!\nThe question to be asked, is the unborn child saved from been born in a\nworld full of religious contradiction or should those who wrong us be\npunished without question?\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie has a good plot and strong acting performances from almost\nall the actors, good screenplay and direction. The only thing it lacks\nis a plausible story. The one thing which bothers me is the reason\nbehind the killer's (John Doe)actions. He starts off by killing an\nobese man because he is gluttonous. Obesity is not caused just by being\ngluttonous. Second is greed. Yes, lawyers are greedy but that is their\nprofession. In fact, in this very movie, John Doe also gets a lawyer\nwho supports him also knowing that he is a serial killer. Is that not a\nsin? Next is sloth. What does a drug dealer got to do with being lazy?\nBehind his every murder, the reason is pretty silly. And the most\nimportant thing which really bothers me is John Doe killing Mills'\nwifey. Mills' wife does not commit any sin that catches his eye and yet\nhe kills her just to unleash Mills' wrath on him. This makes John Doe\nthe biggest sinner of all. I liked zodiac which is more reasonable than\nthis movie. This movie is just average with a terrible music.\n"},

This movie can be called a milestone in the suspense genre.<br><br>Brad Pitt as the young, restless cop Mills has done his job pretty well\n.

And in turn having each person reconsider\ntheir lives and why we are here. David fincher did a brilliant job\ndirecting this film, giving us a glimpse into the horrific underworld\nof the deadly sins, in the cracks of the streets or sidewalks and where\nthe stragglers walk the alley ways, and even capturing the stink of the\nscene where the public cringes their noses watching.

The killer's reasoning\nbehind the murders almost makes it justified, perhaps the most disturbing\naspect of all.<br><br>The action sequences are all realistic and believable(well, as good as it\ngets in Hollywood anyway). The constant rain, the dilapidated sets, unique\ncamera angles, innovative film processing and a oppressive soundtrack make\nSe7en a complete indulgence of the senses.<br><br>As for the ending, it has to be seen to be believed.<br><br>This movie will scar, but then, isn't that what good thrillers\ndo?\n"},
{"review": "\n\nDark, evil tale of a killer using the 7 deadly sins as grounds. The cops on\nhis tail are always one step behind and get to witness the unbelievable\ncruelty that the murderer has inflicted upon his victims. No compromise:\nthis is the most evocative film to appear in recent years, and I bet the\nending had Andrew Kevin Walker bouncing up and down shouting: \"I'm the king\nof the world\" too. Fantastic.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nIts should be classified as the best thriller ever made. Its a classic.\nMorgan and Pitt where extra ordinary, they were made to be together in this\ngreat movie. Though in was not the full version of the story its still\ngreat. In the book Pitt hurt Morgan with his knife and then he was taken to\nthe court, he served a short period as far as I remember.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nFew films genuinely shock me nowadays, but this did. It is horrible yet\nfascinating, it fulfills the morbid curiosity which is in us all whether\nwe\nwant to admit it or not. There have been other films about serial killers\nbut none as desperate or dark as this masterpiece.<br><br>It is the unrelenting mental will of Spacey's character that chilled me\nthe\nmost. His utter insanity was matched only by his ingenuity and discipline.\nHis character is one of the most truly evil in film history, forget\nhannibal\nlecter !<br><br>The whole film is brilliantly made, the performances are great, even from\nBrad Pitt, and the atmosphere is wonderfully set, but there are two\nparticular things which, for me, set this movie apart.<br><br>The first is the way in which the city setting they are in is every bit as\nall consuming and intimdating as Spacey's character. People are swallowed\nup\nand spat out in this world, no one counts. It reminded me very much of an\nAlan Moore graphic novel called 'Watchmen' in which a character called\nRorschach becomes a vigilante to clean the streets of the 'scum'. Spacey's\ncharacter is somewhat like this striving to show people the evil that\nsurrounds them. The irony is that his methods are wholely more evil than\nanything he wishes to illustrate.<br><br>The second is the ending. Never has there been an ending like it to my\nknowledge. It is hard to describe how it makes you feel. There is no way\nhe\ncan lose, you feel cheated whilst still appreciating the cleverness of the\nmanufactured situation. It leaves you with nothing exactly reflecting how\nBrad Pitt's charcter must feel at this moment. The film leaves you\nbewildered and mentally fatigued.<br><br>However the perfectly handled ,and completely unique,  ending completes an\nawesome film.It is very downbeat and critical of humanity, Morgan\nfreeman's\ncharacter re inforces this in his final line, but there was a place for a\nfilm such as this and Se7en filled it.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nSeven is far superior to serial-killer cliches such as Silence of The\nLambs.\nSeven's graphic morbidness only helps exemplify the realities of the\nsituation. Great acting by Pitt, Freeman, and Spacy. The characters are\nbelievable in that they are not perfect or even-tempered;they are real.\nThe\nmovie is real. ...But if you can't handle violence, gore, reality, or\npolitical-incorrectness then stick to Mary Poppins.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nSeven is not your standard serial killer on the loose film.  It is a dark,\ngrimy, visceral thriller that chills you to the bone days, months and years\nafter you've seen it.  The crimes that John Doe perpetrates in this film\ngrow more and more atrocious as the film progresses, and we can't help but\nwatch.  It's a glimpse into ourselves.  We find these events horrible, but\nat the same time we wonder what could push someone to acts such as these?\nThat's where Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman come in.  They provide the\nquestions that we as an audience are afraid to ask.  They doggedly pursue\nthe killer in an attempt to stop him.  The film ratchets up the tension and\nonly in the final act of the film do we meet John Doe.  Kevin Spacey is\nabsolutely chilling.  So calm, so cold and so damn intelligent.  The ending\nknocked me out.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI remember watching \"Alien 3\" and not being too fond of it.  I was impressed\nwith the overall look of the movie and the darkness of it but it just didn't\nseem to fit in with the previous two movies.  I remembered the director's\nname and found myself looking out for more of his work.  I was extremely\nexcited in 1995 when I found out he had directed \"Seven\" since I thought his\ncareer had been destroyed by \"Alien 3\".  I was clearly wrong.  I saw \"Seven\"\nand walked out of the theater not knowing how I felt about the movie.  It\nstayed with me for a week so I went to see it again.  Brilliant!  Morgan\nFreeman is so amazing it's painful.  He takes a cop movie cliche (the soon\nto be retired, embittered cop) and takes it to amazing heights. He allows\nyou to understand his character completely.  A beautiful performance.<br><br>The movie is incredibly dark not only in tone but physically.  Somehow\ncinematographer Darius Khondji manages to take a desert setting in the\nmiddle of the day and make it dark, shadowy and bleak.  The dark look of the\nmovie adds to the overall feel of despair.<br><br>\"Seven\" pretty much gets your attention from the very beginning (introducing\nFreeman's character and Brad Pitt. . .who is really good) and then throws\nyou a pretty disturbed title sequence which makes you kind of twitchy and\nputs you in the proper frame of mind.<br><br>The movie starts off very graphically with the 'gluttony' killing.  If you\nmanage to make it through the scene where the body is discovered (I swear,\nyou can almost smell that apartment!) and the autopsy scene you've already\nsat through the goriest parts.  This doesn't mean that you can relax,\nthough.<br><br>A good job by all involved. We can only hope that David Fincher keeps making\nmovies this disturbing and interesting.  It seems as if he's definitely on\nto something.<br><br>\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is regarded as the definition of a modern thriller. It is\neasy to see why, as it is easily one of the most suspenseful movies I\nhave ever seen. What added to this suspense, was the straightforward,\nyet grim storyline, that keeps the audience interested.<br><br>The plot revolves around two detectives, William Somerset, and David\nMills, trying to solve the mystery of a serial killer. That killer,\nJohn Doe, leaves clues around for unknown reasons. Detective Somerset\nbelieves he (the killer) is following the seven deadly sins (hence the\ntitle Seven, or Se7en, and is leading them to something. What this is,\nis unclear, but they do eventually capture him, and he reveals that his\nfinal victim, is David's wife Tracy, thus showing he was playing a game\nwith them all along.<br><br>There are few movies I have seen, before or since, that are suspenseful\nas this. It is also quite bleak, which did admittedly put me off at\ntimes. It is still a great film, definitely worth a watch, if you are\nold enough (remembering this movie is rated R), and whether or not you\nenjoy it, you will probably find it interesting. From me it gets 8/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI arrived 20 years to late for the hype of this movie but that doesn't\nmake it any different. One of my favourite thrillers. They don't make\nthem like these anymore.. Realistic characters, an evil serial killer\nbut not as much emphasis on gore more storyline.<br><br>David Fincher did a class job, acting from Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman,\nGwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey was beyond outstanding.<br><br>Se7en follows detectives Somerset and Mill... Somerset is an older\nmature detective whos ready to retire whilst Mills is an energetic yet\nnot as knowledgeable, we see more of Mill' private life with his wife\nTracy.<br><br>The movie kicks off after the murder of an obese man... suspicious but\nno motive the cops are at a standstill. That is until a wealthy lawyer\ngets killed and in blood 'Greed' is written. Knowing there is a serial\nkiller on the loose its down to the detectives to hunt a man with an\nobsession with the deadly sins killing innocent people.<br><br>The ending to this movie I like a lot, I wont give it away but it shows\nhow sick and twisted minds of serial killers are.<br><br>Se7en will surely stick in your mind\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film got everything right! I mean every single casting choice,\nscene, and line was perfect! This was Brad Pitt's best role in movie, I\ndon't recall a movie where he ever achieved better acting than here.\nAlso, in my opinion, the same goes for Morgan freeman, him and Brad\nmake a great on screen team. The film was a real mind bender, which I\nlove! The dialogue was unbelievably great! The plot was so genius as\nwell. The twist ending was one of the best twist endings I've ever seen\nhands down! This movie has perfect acting, characters, plot, dialogue,\nending, and it definitely keeps your attention throughout, I wasn't\nbored once, and that's very important to me! 10/10, not a single flaw\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n"},
{"review": "\nI am glad I knew as little as possible about the movie before watching\nit. Seven is a meticulously crafted psychological thriller and one of\nDavid Fincher's best films! That shocking ending blew me away and\ncompletely caught me off guard. Seeing the two detectives following the\nleads and clues to catch the killer was always riveting and thrilling,\nso the whole journey to discover his real intentions was quite\ninteresting to watch. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are excellent as\nalways, but Kevin Spacey is the one who steals the show as the\ningenious serial killer, who is usually one step ahead of them. David\nFincher is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of our time and I still\nhaven't been disappointed by his work so far.\n"},
{"review": "\nI've watched this true masterpiece several times over the years,I have\nyet to watch a film that comes anywhere near it in terms of pure horror\nat the lengths humans will go to inflict pain on each other... The\nbrilliance of this film is you don't see the acts been done,it's left\nto your own imagination. Brad Pitt,Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are\nfantastically cast , the setting is wet and dark,( you never find out\nwhere the city is meant to be ).A Constant feeling of dread runs\nthrough this film which I can only say is an absolute must watch movie.\nIts is in my(and many others) opinion, probably one the best films ever\nmade in the history of film making .. WATCH IT!\n"},
{"review": "\nIts today's cult status this movie gained thanks to the excellent work\nof director David Fincher (whom this was only the second major movie in\nhis career) and screenwriter A.K.Walker (who also wrote the screenplay\nfor \"8MM\"). With this film Fincher ranked himself among the most wanted\ndirectors and gained a reputation of true heir of Hitchcock, which was\nconfirmed by his later movies \"Play\" and \"Panic Room\". The assignment\nof roles in the movie is excellent, and I especially need to emphasize\nBrad Pitt's acting (as in \"Fight Club\") which proved that he is not\njust a beauty figure whose main task is to lure women to cinemas, but\nalso showed that he knows to act! Freeman is excellent in the role of a\nveteran detective - like it was made for him, and Spacey in the role of\nthe killer was, as usual, brilliant and gravely. The atmosphere of the\nfilm is so dark and depressing that the bizarre and terrible murders\nmake it even more stressful. I was particularly impressed by the way\nmurders were described, which are quite original and leave a big\nimpression on the viewer. (Something like that was attempted in\n\"Resurrection\" with C.Lambert but not very successfully, and \"Saw\" -\ninteresting, but not on a par with \"Se7en\"). All in all this is an\nexcellent and original movie which is rarely seen.\n"},
{"review": "\nAs a 15 year old, I did not know what to expect from the movie. All I\nknew is that it was supposedly good and that the actors were the best\nthere are. The storyline takes the viewer on a journey along with the\ncharacters. The viewer soon begins to empathise with Brad Pitt's\nseemingly over- confident character. This is similar for Morgan\nFreeman's cool, calm and collected camera. This turns out to be\nsignificant towards the end of the movie. This movie is no murder\nmystery like any other, and perhaps not much of a murder mystery at\nall. This is due to the difficulty that the detectives have when\nattempting to solve the case. With any other actors, the movie may have\nbeen unbearable as it is often slow paced. However the acting was so\nreal and, well, brilliant that you can't take your eyes off the screen\nfor one second. All in all, the magnificent, unpredictable storyline\ncombined with brilliant acting makes this movie a must- watch for all\nfans of film.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you will see this movie the first thing will come into your mind\nwill be\"Oh my god\". This is a tale of a serial killer and let me tell\nyou this one is quite different from other you seen. This guy (kevins.)\nis looking so intense in the movie. Though the story seems fit to the\ncharacters but the creepiness of the main idea is very unique....!! And\nlike always brad pit is looking handsome and morgen is intelligent but\nkevin is a winner in this movie. when i saw this movie last night i\nwasn't thinking that it will be so intense like its review says on IMDb\nbut just after watching it for 30 min. it gripped me in such a ways\nwhich words can not define. this is movie which you will remember for a\nlifetime and discuss with 1000 people and everyone will have the\ndifferent theory for the characters but i bet on that - everybody will\nbe agree on the idea and the intensity of the movie. A must watch if\nyou like the serial killer movie and light blood n gore but i bet the\nidea will more hit you then this. I am giving it 10/10!! Best in its\ncategory.\n"},

{"review": "\nDavid Fincher, Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey: You can't go\nwrong with this team, can you? This is why Se7en is 9 out of 10 for me.\nAlmost perfect among the films categorized in the group of\nthriller/crime movies. With a very solid plot which does not allow the\nfilm to turn into a clich\u00e9 about cops chasing a serial killer, Se7en\nstands out as a successful thriller. It's a good crime/mystery story\ndelivered by exceptionally good acting, very good directing and a\nflawless screenplay. While Morgan Freeman steals the show, Brad Pitt\nproves that he's a promising actor, and not just one of the most\nhandsome men in Hollywood. Needless to say, Kevin Spacey's performance\nas John Doe leads to one of the unforgettable villains on big screen.\nAll in all, it's a must-see and definitely one of the best of its kind.\n"}
