{"review": "\n\nAh, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't\nlet my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's\none that I never get tired of.<br><br>If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you\nwon't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an \"epic,\" and it doesn't\npretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who\nlater went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).<br><br>A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many\nhave called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the\nshining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of\npraise above its humble-looking shell.<br><br>The casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne\nis convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets\ndrawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his\ncareer as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes\na big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic\nrole. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with\nabsolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes\nit out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show\nincredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from\nthis movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a\ntreat to listen to throughout the flick.<br><br>Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the\nmovie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits\nyou like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second\ntime through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot\na clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie\nmultiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that\nattention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual\nSuspects one of the greatest movies of all time.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\n'The Usual Suspects' has received a lot of comment for its killer twist\nending, which while by no means the first in movie history, has proved to be\nenormously influential (stand up Messrs. Fincher and Shyamalan...). But this\nmovie is so much more than a surprise ending! It is a meticulously scripted,\nfaultlessly acted masterpiece that stands up to repeated viewings. Every\nsingle time I watch it I notice some new detail, or get more enjoyment out\nof a performance or scene.<br><br> This movie really put  Kevin Spacey on the map, but everyone in the\nensemble cast is outstanding, even Stephen Baldwin(!), who has never\nappeared in a movie this good before, or since.  I also got a kick out of\nthe Paul Bartel ( 'Death Race 2000', 'Eating Raoul') cameo, and the\nultra-cool Peter Greene's ('Laws Of Gravity', 'Pulp Fiction') all too brief\nappearance. Bartel is sorely missed, and Greene one day (mark my words!)\nwill become the star he deserves to be.<br><br>Director Bryan Singer has yet to live up to the promise shown here with his\nsubsequent movies, the average 'Apt Pupil' and the disappointing 'X-Men'.\nFor all the acclaim he and the (admittedly superb) cast have received, the\nreal star of 'The Usual Suspects' is Christopher McQuarrie's sensational\nscript, one of the finest of the modern era, and one that genuinely deserved\nit's Oscar.<br><br>It really doesn't get any better than this!! One of the greatest movies ever\nmade, any time, any where. A truly unforgettable experience.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nSuch films like this should be enshrined \nin museums, simply due to the fact it \ndestroyed the entire genre of mystery films. \nWhile this film was unique and captivating, \nno other mystery will ever accomplish this \nsort of cult status, single handedly shaping \na genre. While most mysteries try to shock \nyou too often with twists and even more \ntwists, it turns out to be overkill. This film \nencompassed such ideas with flair and \noriginality, which is probably the reason \nBrian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. \nOnly Memento and The Game are the \nonly recent mystery movies worthy \nenough to stand beside this film. Sadly, \nSinger has somewhat sold out by doing \nthe X-Men movies, but I guess trying to \nmake films like this would be too taxing. \nThis film will always bring a smile to \nmy face when I watch it with someone \nwho hasn't seen this movie.

However, this is not the case; you shall be left speechless and\nwondering how the film achieved its goal.\n"},
{"review": "\n\n\"The Usual Suspects\" is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I bet you can't\nwatch just once.  The film deals with five career crooks who have big plans\nafter they are all brought together in a police lineup.  However, their\nmayhem is interrupted by a mysterious character named Kaiser Sose who plans\nto eliminate all five of the crooks after they all crossed him in various\nways during their checkered pasts.  An amazing original screenplay and tight\ndirection keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout.  Gabriel\nByrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite,\nand Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances.  But it is Kevin\nSpacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes \"The Usual Suspects\" work on\nall levels.  This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be\ncompared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in \"The Godfather, Part II\".  5\nstars out of 5.   \n"},
{"review": "\n\nIf plagiarism were a crime in film techniques, director Bryan Singer would\n be imprisoned for life. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie would be serving\n a similar sentence. However, since it is not, Singer and MacQuarrie (who\n have joined forces again after the not-so-successful PUBLIC ACCESS) took\n advantage and duplicated nothing but the best. From CASABLANCA to PULP\n FICTION, and even a version of a line (intentionally or otherwise) from\n BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.<br><br>Many people oppose watching a film with a twist a second time. I disagree.\n By watching it again you can observe how the director and the screenwriter\n have hidden and revealed clues, how they have tried to steer the audience\n away from the ending. First time is for entertainment. Second time is for\n art. This film is certainly worthwhile to see again. To date, I have\n watched it five times. (Two of those five times I thought, 'well, I'll just\n watch about half-an-hour,' but ended up watching the entire film because it\n is so entertaining.) I'm not exactly a noir fan, so it is assured that this\n particular crime film appeals to a wider audience.<br><br>THE USUAL SUSPECTS has a skilled director, an engrossing screenplay, and ten\n praiseworthy performances.

Kevin Spacey gives one of\nhis two best performances (the other being as John Doe in Se7en) in my\nopinion.  That is probably why he was awarded Best Actor for this role.  It\nwas truly deserved.

{"review": "\nOut of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of\na man in search of the devil. The film is called \" The Usual Suspects\"\nand what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five\nsuspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only\nsurvivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug\ndeal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also\nknown as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling,\ncon-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals,\nStephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster\nand Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then\nset-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several\nguilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross\ncountry and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the\nname of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete\nPostlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they\nundertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group\nis their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel\nByrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from\nmoment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police\nDave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely,\nwhat we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with\nit's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A\nsuperb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan\nSinger. A great film indeed. ****\n"},

Anyway, it's been a long time since I've been taken for such a\njoyride with such interesting characters, even if they are murderers\nand felons. The plot is woven so delicately and the threat is so\ninteresting, that I was involved from the first minute. I always\nwondered how Kevin Spacey, a rather ordinary looking guy with a\nreceding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the\nreason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even\nthough he is a \"gimp.\" There are so many layers in this film, but I\ndon't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is\nquite satisfying.\n"},

This is fiction, anyway. I love David\nLynch and he certainly likes to lie with his camera. No, I don't mind\nthat Verbal was lying. It was obvious that he was the main mover, but\nthere was no motive for his killing of the other 4 and the crew. I\nsuppose they must have done him wrong somehow.

{"review": "\nAlthough Bryan Singer has directed some pretty good movies (X-Men, X2,\nValkyrie, Apt Pupil), nothing comes close to this masterpiece. The\nintricate storyline follows a cop (Chazz Palminteri) trying to solve\nthe mystery of the identity of a mysterious and very feared Keyser\nS\u00f6ze. The suspects include a strong cast consisting of Stephen Baldwin,\nGabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollack, and Kevin Spacey. The\nfilm is strong in every area: soundtrack, sound effects, visual\neffects, etc., but its legend comes from its superb writing, both in\ndialogue and plot. This is a very fun flick to watch time and time\nagain and is probably necessary to watch more than once in order to\npiece together the complicated mystery.\n"},
{"review": "\nAll credit to Bryan Singer!! Without doubt his best film so far..\nWaiting on Valkyrie by Bryan due for release may be in 2009.. Hope that\nwill be a blast too.<br><br>On watching \"The Usual Suspects\", you should take note of each scene\nthat goes by.. Else you ll have to go through the second time to make\nsome sense of the end. Singer stands out with the best on this...<br><br>Kevin spacey is the standout performer in this movie... Even though\neveryone else chips in and plays their roles flawlessly.... This should\nhave been Spacey's best performance except for \" The life of David\nBale\" which i was privileged to watch most recently...<br><br>This movie is certainly one of the best in the 90's.\n"},
{"review": "\na very great film . contains so much twists and turns u wont believe.\nThe only main thing is who is the devil, Kyzer soze. He is keeping his\nidentity secret and playing his games right in heart of the underworld.\nHe himself using 5 brave but misguided and frustrated young men by\nexploiting their weaknesses and compulsions. In the whole movie you\nwill keep on wondering who is kyzer soze in reality and when u know in\nthe end u will be taken aback and shocked , on the other hand u ll also\npraise his genius of deception and elusiveness. This film contains\nsuspense with action in a far better way the stereo type action movies\ncontain. The most inspiring actors are here Kevin spacey and Gabriel\nByrne. Highly recommended , if u like movies , must see it. i believe\nevery one can enjoy the film , it makes one totally absorb in the story\n, u ll always like to know the complexity of the characters in the\nfilm.\n"},
{"review": "\nAfter hearing people rave about this movie I finally managed to watch\nthis movie a couple of months ago. I have to admit it the first time I\ndisliked it, I probably wasn't concentrating. The second time I\nabsolutely loved it. The usual suspect is fantastic twisty thriller\nbacked up by wonderful performances from all the main leads.It seems\nhard to imagine thatthe writer of The Usual Suspects was only twenty\nfour when he wrote it.Kevin Spacey in my opinion completely stole the\nshow. Even though I knew whatthe final twist was it did hinder me from\nappreciating it. What is so amazing is how the writer managed to\nskillfully put in clues that could lead us to a conclusion but the\nreferences are so slight we might not notice it. It seems to have\ninspired other movies with twists at the end that leave your head\nspinning, for instance The Sixth Sense. The Usual Suspects in my\nopinion is the best thriller of the 90's.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this film when I was in my last year at sixth form college. My\nbrother had recommended it to me the night before and as I was supposed\nto be revising for my exams, I decided to watch the film. Before\nwatching this film, I had never really sat at the edge of my seat all\nthe way through a movie: I did with this one. I was hooked from start\nto finish. <br><br>The film doesn't just have one of the best endings of all time, but the\nactual body of the film is virtually flawless. I have watched this film\nover 20 times and I'm still finding new things in the movie that I\ndidn't pick up before!! Everything about this film was of a very high\nstandard, especially the cast- Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey and Pete\nPostlethwaite to name but a few. <br><br>To highlight what a great film this is, it's been mentioned in many\nscreen writing books as a study case. It has so many twists turns, not\nonly in the storyline but in the relationships between the characters.<br><br>This is a must see film for anyone who loves films, as it really shows\nhow a film should be made.\n"},
{"review": "\nMost movies are like taking the highway from point A to Point B.\nOK...sometimes you do get off the beaten path and take an exit you\ndidn't expect, But it's still point A to point B.<br><br>This movie, however, takes all the back roads, some of them unpaved and\nvery bumpy, some of them narrow and curvy, and some of them downright\nscary! I am not going to give away ANYTHING in this movie, because I\nbelieve it would be a disservice to anyone who hasn't seen the movie\nbefore. I will only say that it's one of the best whodunits I have ever\nseen! Kevin Spacey is spectacular with his understated performance. He\nand the rest of the cast work magic with this wonderful script.<br><br>The cinematography, while not being sweeping vistas, move the story\nalong nicely, and the score is foreboding, without obviously leading\nyou.<br><br>The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I figured a key point\nout before it was revealed.<br><br>What that key point is, I'm not going to say!\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this movie only recently and began thinking absolutely nothing of\nit, it was boring and I had absolutely no idea of what was going on. It\nwas when you found out about Kaiser Sozar that I began to become exited\nwith this movie. From then on to the very end of the movie I realized\nwhy this movie is supposed to be a cult classic. The acting was great\nfrom Kevin Spacey and the movie was interesting and suspenseful. I also\nenjoyed Stephen Baldwins cool character. I also enjoyed they end of the\nstory when they were on the boat with the Hungarian Mafia and all of\nthe mysterious deaths. After that the very ending was just the cherry\non the cake it was overall a great movie and a noticeable cult classic.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's so pleasing to know that great films are still being made, if even\non an far too infrequent basis. The Usual Suspects please on so many\nlevels its hard to put into words. Bryan Singer comes out of nowhere to\ndirect only his SECOND feature film and hits a home run. While he's now\nquite famous from his work on the X-Men films, what he did with the\nUsual Suspects is far beyond any expectations that could have been\nplaced on him. Christopher McQuarrie (who also worked with Singer on\nhis first film) also comes out of nowhere to write a script so well\nthought out and put together its sad to think he's only turned out an\nindie and Way of the Gun since. And lastly, the cast are terrific. Top\nto bottom (even Baldwin) are great. Benicio Del Toro steals every scene\nhe is in with his awkward, mumbling way of talking. And this really\nmarked the start of Kevin Spacey's ascent into A list stardom in\nHollywood. In addition to his standout performance in this film, he\nquickly followed it with parts in Seven, A Time to Kill and LA\nConfidential. If you're looking for one of the great films of the 90s,\nyou've found it.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt has been one of my \"How on Earth did I miss that?\" movies. Everyone\nhas been telling me about the movie and now after all that fuss I've\nseen it with my own eyes.<br><br>The acting is exceptional. In all sense, it captures the attention and\npulls you right into the action. You feel the whole movie developing\naround you and you understand everything. However in this movie we see\nthat what we do not see is true.<br><br>The scenario is also well built. The notion of power has been widely\ndepressed on us as well as on the characters. There is a story inside a\nstory and it is all about power. And the better thing is, as long as\nyou believe, the power is where your beliefs are.<br><br>This is surely a must-see movie regarding the movie. It is a\nmust-must-see regarding the acting. It is a\nshame-not-to-have-ever-watched-it movie regarding your friends.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is in my opinion, the greatest movie ever. I have been able to\npredict the end of most movies; my friends have accused me of seeing\nthe movies previously and then trying to show off in front of them by\nguessing the end. But when the end of this movie came around; I was\npacing the floor in front of my TV in total disbelief. I had to replay\nthe ending again, it was that amazing. Everything was there, all of the\nevidence, but it was hidden very well. If there were more movies like\nthis the film industry would not be in as much trouble as it claims to\nbe. If there is any movie you see ever it should be the Usual Suspects.\nAbsolutely great movie, don't rent it...buy it.\n"},
{"review": "\n\n\"The Usual Suspects\" is a thrilling crime drama, filled with suspense. \nKevin Spacey plays Verbal Kint, the narrator of a twisted tale that begins\nwith a police lineup in New York, and ends with a dockside massacre in\nCalifornia.  Behind it all is the mysterious and dangerous Keyser Soze. \nBryan Singer's criminal saga is haunting and clever, and well cast.  Kevin\nSpacey turns in a great performance as Verbal, setting an oddball tone.  The\nrest of the crew is headed by Gabriel Byrne's Dean Keaton, with thugs Kevin\nPollack, Benicio Del Toro and Stephen Baldwin along for the ride.  This crew\nof five shows great clashing chemistry.  In the end, you'll be shocked. \n\"The Usual Suspects\" has become a new crime cult classic.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nWhen I first saw this movie, I was simply amazed. The second time, even\nmore amazed. And subsequently each time I watch it, I find something\nnew and undiscovered. The joy of watching it with friends who haven't\nseen it only makes it that much more pleasurable. Stories like this\npull you in and make you wonder. They make you think. They make you\nentertained. And that is what we, as a movie audience want--the payoff.\nAll of the wonderful ingredients of a film--the plot, casting,\nlighting, and cinematography make such a gem like this come together\ncohesively. This is the type of film that made me want to be involved\nin the film making process. An excellent film from an excellent\ndirector...\n\n"},
{"review": "\nA group of criminals are brought in for questioning about a crime, but\nfrom the manner in which they are thrown together it is clear - even to\nthe criminals themselves - that something is a-foot.<br><br>A classic example of how different the world of film is to the world of\nliterature. If this was a book the publisher would ask \"how drunk were\nyou when you wrote this?\" Thankfully film has music, acting (the best\nthing here) and special effects to distract the viewer. And this film\ndoes a fair-to-middling job. <br><br>Here we have a film that doesn't so much contain holes, but is more one\ngiant hole. However in this big hole we have various smaller holes!

It may have a\ntwist ending, but when you have confused the living daylights out of\nany sensible and logical person (and yes I do know flashbacks are not\nalways the truth!) then a song and dance finale wouldn't have made any\nless sense.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI have to agree with Roger Ebert who gave this film 1,5 stars. It really\ndoesn't do anything except explain to you its complicated and uninteresting\nplot. The much-praised ending isn't clever either, just a nice sample of\nsolid directing. I've seen it twice and the second watch was even more of a\ndisappointment. A few stylish characters are probably enough for some people\nto enjoy this. Not for me.\n"},
{"review": "\nPlot and acting I thought were great, but I feel the accent by the\nfirst suspect that died was a bit exaggerated and difficult to\nunderstand.<br><br>While I did know about the existence of a twist, I was caught off guard\nby the double twist, so I was a bit happy about the surprise.<br><br>Despite this, I feel the premise of the movie was a bit off and merely\nused as a setup to the climax of the film. What kind of person would\nwork so hard to make a convoluted plan to use convicts to help him kill\na boat full of people just so people wouldn't know who he was. And then\nin the end he is so careless as to let one live and also end up making\nit so his identity is revealed to even more people.<br><br>Despite this, the devil line quote was memorable and also the dialogue\nin the rest of the movie.

{"review": "\nSay what you will about this low-budget Oscar winning hit-but if you\nwere lucky enough to catch it initially on the big-screen then you know\nwhat I mean. It opens up with the tail end of a massacre on boat just\nbefore being lit up to flames. We then end up in interrogation room\nwith Verbal Kint (played by Kevin Spacey) telling the cops how he ended\nup on the boat. At this point the movie seems to pick up the events\n(mostly) in the order they happened until those crucial moments on the\nhorrific ship. As Verbal goes into detail how him and four other\nex-cons were wrongfully detained for questioning 6 weeks earlier and\nended up working together 'taking jobs.' There's Keeton (Gabriel Byrne)\nwho is looking for way out and go straight, Finster (Benicio Del Toro\nwho really started his career here literally) whose horrible accent\nbrings a lot of laughs but basically pals around his convict hot headed\nbuddy McMannis(Stephen Baldwin). Then there's Hockney(Kevin\nPollock)whose comedic input serves the tone well especially since he\nreally plays the angry smart ass of the gang. I really don't want to\ntype too much else cause either A most of you know the story even if\nyou haven't seen it or B you've seen it. What I really wanted to say\nabout this movie is that people who don't like it are people who never\nreally got it or people who have not seen the whole thing from the\nbeginning. Yes I said I love this movie and I'll always defend it.\nHowever, the movie holds up the best way in an initial viewing or maybe\n4 or 5 times after that.\n"},

{"review": "\nWhy many people think so highly of The Usual Suspetcs is a mystery.\nI'll give it 6 out of 10 because of some fine performances, most\nnotably Kevin Spacey's, but as a whole the thing is a violence-filled\nmess. The ending simply does not follow from the film and seems to have\nbeen dragged in to resolve a problem that is not all that interesting\nto begin with. The editing is also confusing; without seeing it at\nleast a second time it is hard to make sense of what has happened when.\nThroughout the film we are led to believe that the character played by\nGabriel Byrne is central to the plot, only to discover at the end that\nhe is not. To put it succinctly: this film cheats the viewer. Don't\ntrust the judgment of anybody who tells you that this is a great or\neven a good film.\n"},
