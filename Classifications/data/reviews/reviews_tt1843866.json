{"review": "\nRobert Redford is willing to sacrifice hundreds of millions for the\nlives of billions, the 'good guys' are willing to kill hundreds to save\nthe lives of those hundreds of millions. Both are playing a numbers\ngame, the only difference is that Redford's is on a bigger scale and\nisn't hypocritical, he acknowledges the human cost, the 'good guys'\ntreat the hundreds of soldiers they kill (and the many civilian\ncasualties resulting from their lavish tactics) simply as necessary to\nget the job done. This is a fight of visionaries against hypocrites,\nand hypocrites win. An awful message, an awful movie. It also has the\nstandard 'just in the nick of time' tropes, ridiculous and impossible\nfight scenes, a frankly annoying score and the ever-loathable Samuel L\nJackson.\n"},
{"review": "\nNever have I watched a movie with so many clich\u00e9d lines, excessive use\nof firearms and complete lack of credible story line. Plot twists were\ntedious and lines were forced and overacted. I believe Marvel has taken\na turn for the worst. Why couldn't have been as well acted and written\nas the Avengers? Instead we are given a mockery of all superhero movies\nto date. We have been presented with unnecessary amounts of CGI and\nguns and killing. Superhero movies are supposed to present morals. How\ncan a superhero movie depict a couple of characters running around\nshooting at each other and killing massive amounts of people in the\nprocess. In my opinion just plain awful. I can't but I'd rather give it\na 0/10. (Only giving this review for the people with good taste in\nmovies and are not forced to watch it like I was)\n"},
{"review": "\nA fine mediocre movie. Not too good, not too bad. It is so overrated.\nBad action scenes with shaky cams and tons of cuts. The story is OK.\nThe villain is really good. Had charisma and charm throughout the\nmovie. The movie was boring throughout with some cool scenes in it. The\ncharacter development for Falcon is poor. He is not given any origin\nstory. No flashbacks yet he is the main sidekick of Captain America.\nThe ending was cheesy. You might not like it. The CGI in the movie was\nnoticeable and seemed fake. Fairly, this movie is one-time watch only.\nThis movie was maybe one of the finest Marvel movie but it is not the\nbest. This movie is overrated among fans.\n"},
{"review": "\nPersonally I was not impressed with this movie, certainly not as good\nas the first movie, but then squeals that are as good or better than\nthe original are rare. I found the storyline quite weak and the\ndialogue hard to hear over the too loud mood music, editors never seem\nto learn this fact. The SFX were OK but nothing breath-taking, and the\nacting was lack-lustre. In saying all this I enjoyed the movie and\nwould recommend it as a easy-to-watch piece of entertainment, with a\nbucket of popcorn a cup of coke/coffee and your Kindle to read to stop\nyou getting bored. Someone to wake you up for the exciting bits would\nalso be an advantage.\n"},

{"review": "\nFormulaic, boring. I wasn't compelled to care about the characters or\nthe story. Interesting moral dilemmas always ended in the clich\u00e9d\nsentimental choice.

His\nchoice was illogical and irresponsible to the larger context of his\nlife and humanity. The way his character is morally structured, it\ndidn't make sense.<br><br>I'm always baffled by these superheroes/saviors/good guys who are\nchased around and have no problem causing mass destruction and loss of\nlife.

Second, even though this is a movie that is supposed to be\nabout heroism (hence the super hero!), it really had nothing heroic\nabout it other then a guy who's power was given by experiments an is\nnow able to fight bad guys.

{"review": "\nI don't think anyone was expecting Captain America: The Winter Soldier\nto be just as bloody fantastic as It was. Honestly, from the beginning\nto the end It's thrilling, It's action packed, It works as something\nthat's more than a superhero movie and It's just fantastic. Not to\nmention is the cast joined by Robert Redford (no, seriously they\nmanaged to get Robert Redford) and the continuing evolution of\ncharacters of Captain America, Black Widow and Nick Fury whilst\nintroducing new characters like Falcon and of course the bad ass\nantagonist of the movie, The Winter Soldier. The action scenes like the\nbrawl in the elevator scene and the epic first confrontation between\nCaptain America and the soldier stand out above not just the MCU, but\nsuperhero movies altogether. And also to comment on, is the amazingly\ncomplex and intricately written plot of mystery, deceit and the past\ncatching up with people. Truly gripping, as pretty much everything in\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier is.\n"},
{"review": "\nIn recent years it seemed to me all too often that action movies\ndirectors and script writers felt like they had to choose between\ncharacters development and a coherent plot, this one strike the balance\nas close to perfection as I've seen in a very long while. It does help\nthe actors (as I've said more than once - good actors can work wonders\nwhen they have properly written characters to work with), and even more\nimportant as far as I'm concerned, it helps in examining the moral core\nof the whole sci-fi comics concept. The inherent fascist undercurrents\nof the entire super hero idea. This concept has been dealt with by all\nthe real good comics adaptations, both on screen and on print.<br><br>Bottom line, it's a fun ride with added value to boot, if you like\nsci-fi comics adaptations, this one is a must see.\n"},

Although\nAvengers was placed as one of the highest grossing films of its genre\nand the very Captain America : The First Avenger, as of the most\nanticipated , Captain America : The Winter Soldier , is a delight on\nscreen. From the start you can receive all the care of the production\nand excellent work in each of the departments in charge of this\nrelease. I could delve into details but I refer to say it is a very\ngood choice for a movie of this season. I can add that the references\nto the Marvel world parallel to this episode does not detract much less\naffected by the inclusion of chronological attachments in this second\npart of the \" Cap \" . At no time affected the time-line or the argument\nof this epic showdown .

This film dealt with real life government issues such as how\nfar should the government go to keep us safe. The fight choreography\nleaves Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America in the\nAvengers by a gap. I have never seen so much character development in a\nMarvel movie as much as Captain America. In this movie we really get to\nsee Steve Rogers flesh out his abilities. I am usually against Marvel\nmovies so for me to incredible compliment this film is saying\nsomething. This is a must watch. Do watch it in cinemas.

Okay, Okay, i know the story gets updated,\nhey, i read Brubaker, but this film, in my opinion, like the last Iron\nMan film,is an example of Marvel's arrogance in thinking they can\napprove crap movies.

Sure there's lots of CGI chaff to distract you from\nthe basic premise, which has been overused in better movies. It lacks\nthe wit and originality of Avengers and great series like Star Trek\nNext Gen and Firefly. The acting is dire and the plot so predictable I\nwalked out a good 45 mins before the end. Watch it and weep. I got the\nfeeling that this is the type of film which will appeal to hyperactive\n12 yr old boys who are into computer games and little else.

The different approach that the\ndirector's took with Captain America also helped elevate not only the\nmovie, but also the status of the Super Soldier himself.

{"review": "\nIn 2008, director Christopher Nolan did his part to change the world of\ncomic book movies.

Of course, in that same time span,\nMarvel Studios has left an equally impactful mark. Not only have they\ndelivered differently toned superhero stories \u0096 favoring the bright and\nfun over the dark and dramatic \u0096 but they've also developed the\ninnovative and risky Marvel Cinematic Universe that webs together all\nof the studio's characters into one shared world.\n"},

There was a lot of comic relief in\nthe fight scenes but it was not done like in iron man 3 where the\ncomedy distracted me it was done in such a way that it made me laugh\nbut didn't distract me from the fighting. The falcon was put into the\nmovie perfectly not like in the avengers assemble TV show in that show\nhe is made to look like a childish hero but in the movie he was done so\nmuch better that it made me forget that the childish falcon even\nexisted. The winter soldier is a great villain and I can't wait to see\nhim in the future movies. So if you haven't seen this movie I would\ndefinitely say for you to go and see it as soon as possible.\n"},
{"review": "\nThroughout the film, my mind was blown all over the place. Yes, my\nexpectation to this film was very low because of the first one (that\nbrought me to sleep). But when the movie start, there is a feeling that\nthis film might be good, not awesome,not yet. Along the journey of the\nfilm till the end, my expectation change 180 degree. Its action-packed,\nemotional, elegant(in an awesome way) and bedazzled. I am really mad of\nmyself because giving this such a low expectation. But above all this,\ni just wanna say, Captain America, you're the best Marvel's movie in my\nentire life although you're kinda old-school. This also maybe had\novercome Marvel's The Avengers (which also my favorite superhero\nmovie). BTW, the scene between the credits is awesome as an\nintroduction to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.\n"},
{"review": "\nTo be honest, I never really liked Captain America as a hero. I was\nmore a Spiderman/Batman guy. But, after seeing this movie, my thoughts\nhave changed. Chris Evans acts wonderfully as Cap with all the jokes\nand fighting. The action sequences are just amazing. And the twist in\nthe middle. AH-MAZING! But the other actors do a terrific job. Anthony\nMackie is just too good as Falcon, Samuel L Jackson excels again as\nNick Fury, Sebastian Stan makes the most badass villain ever, but\nRobert Redford is the clincher. His acting is just masterful. Must\nwatch for any moviefan. P.s- watch the credits scene, important stuff\nhappens ;)\n"},
{"review": "\nMarvel has been doing great movies since the start, and the all new\ncaptain America is once again, another film that's up to all fan's\nexpectations. I find Captain America The Winter soldier an excellent\nand engaging movie, which will engulf you into a world of excitement\nand entertainment. In this movie you finally see Steve Rogers dealing\nwith the new modern world, and it added more feeling to the movie\nseeing that he wasn't absolutely comfortable with the new modern world.\nSPOILERS. Once you find out that The Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes,\nthe movie gets interesting because you start to wonder how captain\nAmerica is going to fight his best friend? The baddie doesn't have many\nlines, but was all told by his eyes and movements, great acting\nSebastian. Chris Evans was also an amazing actor, he portrayed the\ncharacter brilliantly. It was an excellent movie, and everybody should\nbuy the next tickets for The Winter Soldier in the cinema near you.\n"},

When Steve's old friend Bucky Barnes as the winter solider\nwho has been brainwashed by hydra into being a assassin it makes Steve\nquestion the morality of shield and its ethics. In terms of the\nnewcomers I would say that Anthony mackie is fantastic as Sam Wilson\naka the falcon who is an important ally to Steve Rogers. I do wish that\nEmily van camp would have been given more to do as Sharon carter ask\nagent 13 but hopefully her role will be bigger in the third film. I\nwould say that Robert Redford as Alexander pierce is a rather\ninteresting addition to the role since there is a sense of mystery to\nhis character.

Everyone in Shield believes that Steve had shot Nick Fury.\nLuckily for Steve a girl knew who shot Fury! Together, they found out\nthat a terrorist group called Hydra - tracing back to the Nazi days -\nhad secretly been controlling Shield through the secretary of the\nSecurity Council.

As much as I enjoyed\nboth movies, this has made Phase 2 STELLAR! I look forward to the rest\nof Phase 2. And I'm pumped for Phase 3. The action in the movie is deep\nand the lack of CGI makes the movie that much better and more realistic\nthan others in the Marvel Universe.
