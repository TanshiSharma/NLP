{"review": "\nThis is one of the most terrible movie I've ever seen. A torture. I\ncould barely stay still on my sit. I almost left the room 1 hour before\nthe end. But I stayed, hoping for something good to happen. But\nsomething good never happened and the ending is even worst that my\nworst expectations.<br><br>The trailer was such a lie. I was expecting something dark, mysterious\nand brainy. Something like The Dark Knight. Instead it's only military\ncrap, dinosaurs fight and worthless American patriotism. Makes me sick.\nThe movie dies with Bryan Cranston. The only problem is that his part\ndoesn't last half an hour.<br><br>Godzilla wasn't an earthquake. It wasn't a typhoon. It was just sh*t.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst I need to tell that I am from Central Europe. I am not writing\nreviews but I can't be silent. This was terrible. This was 1st time\nwhen after movie everybody was talking how bad it was. And everybody I\nmean whole cinema.<br><br>First 20-30 minutes were watchable. It was looking to be a solid movie,\nbut after that everything goes wrong. And I mean everything... Bad\ndialog's; good music in very bad moments and several styles of it; main\ncharacter immortal; American happy ending style; no logic in this movie\nanywhere; many mistakes noticeable for everyone...<br><br>If a Uwe Boll have more money, he will make this movie better. When I\nwas watching Sharknado, I was less shocked by stupidity like in this\nmovie. It is waste of your time and money and watch it only when you\nwant to punish yourself.\n"},
{"review": "\nWorse film ever! save your money and don't go. Godzilla is only in the\nfilm for a maximum of 10 minutes, the rest of the 90 minutes or so,\nthat I lost of my life, is filled with mediocre acting that was about\nas exciting as treading on an upturned plug with no shoes on. I got the\nimpression that the majority of the budget was spent on the sets and\nactors, leaving the effects for Godzilla until last, which resulted in\nhim having minimal time in the film. Literally, up until the 70 minute\nmark, you only saw a tail and a few spines from his back. When a\nheadshot finally materialised, it was only for a matter of seconds. I\ngenuinely feel short changed and would strongly recommend that anyone\nplanning to see the film should wait for it to come out on DVD.\n"},
{"review": "\nI wasn't sure if I should have gone to see this movie, but then my\nfriends asked me to go and see it with them, so I did. After seeing the\nmovie I thought that paying for seeing this movie was a mistake. I have\ngenerally somewhat liked movies like Godzilla, but this one was a\nbitter disappointment for me. I can't point out a single reason for why\nI disliked the movie, because there were many things that made the\nmovie unenjoyable. To begin with, I think that the story and plot felt\nunfinished and unwieldy, with no surprises at all. Another sin for the\nmovie were the paper-thin and indifferent characters, who stayed\nirksomely distant for the whole two-hour length of the film. In fact,\nthe characters felt so distant and glued-on-top, that I could have\nwatched the entire film without seeing any of them. Finally, the last\nstraw was the way too long and unsurprising ending battle. All in all,\nthis movie was sadly not worth watching in my opinion.\n"},
{"review": "\nFinally sat down to watch this movie today. After all the hype it had\nhad it's fair share of great moments but in the end felt something was\nmissing. I'll agree with many that Godzilla wasn't shown as much as he\nshould have and maybe that was what missing or maybe it wasn't.\nNeedless to say even though Godzilla doesn't make many appearances in\nthis movie it still is a rather good movie with a an interesting story\nline. The best way to go into this movie is to not buy into Hollywood's\nhype because if you go into it like that you will be disappointed\ngreatly. Overall I was satisfied with Godzilla. Great story, special\neffects, and even the acting was pretty solid. Worth the 2 hours for\nsure. Sit back, grab some popcorn and beverage and enjoy!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film couldn't decide what it was, they wanted to put action into\nit but this is primarily a drama. Godzilla is meant to be an action\nfilm, it should be action packed. Any time it got to action it would\nchange scene onto a character I couldn't give two shits about. <br><br>Also why is it that Godzilla and the MUTO's have the ability to be\ninvisible? how is it that nobody could see these 100ft monsters until\nthey were right in front of them? how comes Godzilla's footsteps don't\ncause mini earthquakes in the train scene he should have shattered all\nthat glass with him stamping like that. this is 2014 they had enough\nmoney CGI is advanced enough.<br><br>Godzilla looked freaking awesome the few times we actually got to see\nit more Godzilla in a film could Godzilla would be nice.\n"},
{"review": "\nI LOVED this film. The sounds and special effects and editing of it was\njust amazing. Godzilla was teased and then revealed extremely well. A\nlot of people complain that they didn't like the short amount of screen\ntime he got, but i think it was great directing and writing! It wasn't\ntoo 'destroy everything' but it wasn't too much drama. All bad reviews\nof this film I've seen have been mainly because (spoiler) Bryan's\ncharacter died early on which wasn't forbade in the trailer. I think\nthe surprise of it was very good and really change up the film with\nthat person 'who was right in the end'. I think this film was\nphenomenal and i wouldn't be surprised if it wins an Oscar for best\nspecial effects.\n"},
{"review": "\nOld memories never die. I was living in Tokyo in 1954 the year that\nGodzilla first appeared and destroyed most of the City. It is something\nthat I have never forgotten to this day. OK I know this guy is nuts. I\nwas not even alive in 1954. I saw the Movie when it came out Thursday\nNight and had to sleep on it. After absorbing it all in I think I can\nsay that I really liked the Movie and think that most Movie goers\nespecially hard core Godzilla fans will like this Movie. Give it a shot\nand see what you think. I have seen every Godzilla Movie that I can get\nmy hands on and think that this may be my favourite. Now we will have\nto wait and see if they will recycle any of the other Japanese\nMonsters. Gamera, Mothra or any others.\n"},
{"review": "\nIt is my first review..I waited this movie since announcement.Since\nmovie's release i checked RT score and metacritic.Some were\ndisappointed.Maybe they are not monster kind person. First in IMDb it\nwas 9.3 ,when i checked.After that it started decreasing. In 16th of my\ni immediately bought a ticket and went to watch it.Unfortunately in my\ncity there is no IMAX 3d theater ,so i handled real 3d. When movie\nstarted first part was kinda drama. Bryan Cranston acted\nperfectly.Maybe he will be nominated for best actor in supporting\nrole.Emotional part describes history of Godzilla and arising new\nMUTOS.After first break action part was just stunning.I was amazed by\nCGI and sound effects. Roar of Godzilla and other monsters makes you\nthrill.In movie i think i saw Godzilla just about 20-30 minutes, but\nwhen i saw ,it was cool.That few minutes was enough for my\nexpectations..(sorry for my English mistakes)\n"},

I\nwould SERIOUSLY give it only a 6/10, but the message is clear: Nuclear\n= bad. So 10/10. Actors ? Like, seriously ? Aaron-epic. Bryan-epic.\nElizabeth... I didn't heard of her before but she's darn cute and\ntalented. They all played very well. You can tell is kinda hard to send\nthese emotions while watching a green screen, because that's what they\nwere doing while shooting this movie. They were watching a green screen\nwhere Godzilla or MUTO should had been, and they must look surprised\nand scared. And... they did a great job.<br><br>Plus, you have a couple of epic moments with Atomic Breath. When\nGodzillas spine started to turn blue I lost my s*it. Roars... ? They're\nthere. Oh God, yes they are. 3D IMAX was beautiful. Go and watch it. <br><br>And I hope these guys are gonna make another Godzilla movie. It\nseriously made me become obsessed with the movie and the character\nitself Godzilla.\n"},
{"review": "\nLet's just be short and blunt. This movie is worth the watch. Its\nnothing like the embarrassing 1998 film based in new York and the \"worm\nguy\" its not campy nor a let down this is getting Godzilla back to its\nroots as king of the monsters. Love it.let's also say this movie earns\nmy rating for the fact it doesn't have one, not two but three freaking\ntitans (Godzilla included in this count) The actors did amazing there\nparts where very believable which us nice. The CG is simply amazing.\nThis movie keeps you at the edge of your sit straight from the\nbeginning. I'm am happy to be a part of being a viewer of this movie.\nSome will not agree with me but that's OK in my opinion. Thanks for\nreading and keep it robot friendly.\n"},
{"review": "\nTo all the people who complain there wasn't enough Godzilla in this\nmovie: Have you ever seen the original Gojira (1954)? Or ever heard of\na thing called 'tension-building'? Surely not.<br><br>This film was everything I hoped it would be and then some! The\ncharacters were all great, there isn't a single bad performance -\neveryone treats this with respect and add an appropriately serious tone\nto the film. Ford Brody is my favorite as his strict code of Honor and\nmorals was put to the test by malevolent creatures, which created some\nbrilliant dilemmas and great duo scenes with his father (played\nbrilliantly by Bryan Cranston). Themes were perfectly adapted from the\noriginal Gojira, which makes this 10x more dark and gritty!\n"},
{"review": "\nGodzilla was absolutely amazing. The graphics, storyline, and\ncharacters all created a positive attribute to the movie. The director\ndid a great job in reincarnating the movie in 2014. The graphics were\nmore than I expected as detail was put to Godzilla, which at first\ngoing into the movie I thought would be different. Then there are the\nMUTO monsters who were also detailed. Moving on to the storyline, it\nwas easy to follow and understand what was happening compared to other\nrecent movies I have watched. The characters or the actors nailed each\nrole which helped the movie become better. I would also like to note\nthe soundtracks used for the movie were awesome. Overall the movie was\nexcellent and I recommend that you watch it.\n"},
{"review": "\nSPOILER ALERT<br><br>The movie is absolutely terrible and I will give you ten reasons not to\nsee it:<br><br>1. You sit through a two hour Godzilla movie and don't see Godzilla for\nover an hour into the show and even then you only see him for about 20\nminutes.<br><br>2. The digital art and video graphics are not of high quality.<br><br>3, There is no character development and I found myself not caring what\nhappens to any of the main characters.<br><br>4. The movie starts out with Brian Cranston which is cool but he is\ngone after a very short time leaving viewers confused<br><br>5. The plot made no sense at all<br><br>6.

{"review": "\nI have loved Godzilla since I was knee high to a grasshopper. I have to\nsay this is the worst one ever, and yes I include the Matthew Broderick\nversion in the running. The \"star\" of the movie seemed to be the\nnuclear bomb. It felt like the bomb got more screen time than Godzilla\ndid. This movie felt more like an anti nuclear power protest than it\ndid a movie about Godzilla.<br><br>I watch Godzilla movies so I can see the namesake of the movie, come\nout of the ocean, destroy a major metropolitan city or two, possibly\nfight off some other major monster in a titan monsters MMA grudge\nmatch, then cheer as he escapes back into the ocean until the next\ntime. <br><br>Frankly, this bomb should have been called, \"The Bomb,\" guest starring\nGodzilla.\n"},
{"review": "\nAre we really that gullible as consumers? The movie magicians\nhocus-pocused us into spending $12 to see this unforgivable trash.

{"review": "\nI thought that this movie is the best Godzilla movie that we have in\nyears. Godzilla is back and better than ever with a cool looking design\nand of course atomic breath! This is my favorite movie of 2014 and\nwe're glad to see the return of the king of the monsters on the big\nscreen. The MUTO's (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) are a\nthreat and that's not a bad thing cause they look great. They sure know\nhow to give Godzilla a challenge in the final fight. Some people don't\nlike the movie mainly cause of the screen time of Godzilla. But does\nthat stop me from liking the film? No, of course it won't. If you're a\nhuge Godzilla fan like i am, definitely go see it. You will not be\ndisappointed when you see it.\n"},
{"review": "\nI hate it when the people say there wasn't much action. The original\nGodzilla focused on the humans, and Godzilla was the result of nuclear\nactivity and taught a very valued lesson about the environment.\nGodzilla has only had limited amount of screen time through out the\nmovies by TOHO, the creators. The Godzilla from 1998 was a disgrace and\nwasn't even Godzilla, because TOHO made a movie after that, that kicked\n1998's butt. TOHO watched 2014 Godzilla and said it was a fantastic\nmovie, but that wasn't why I went to see it. The movie was great, it\nhad beautiful camera work, and it was suspenseful. The movie kept you\non the edge of the seat, and the initial roar from the God himself\nmakes the theater rumble. I'm sure everyone's inner child was\nsatisfied. If you haven't seen the movie, you should. TOHO loves the\nmovie, why shouldn't you? All and all, this movie is a great addition\nto the Godzilla franchise and I cannot wait for the sequel.\n"},
{"review": "\nOK, first off I am kind of angry with some of the critics. Don't go\ninto a GODZILLA based movie with monsters and expect this awesome plot\nthat will blow your mind.

{"review": "\nGodzilla is back! Sure Roland Emmerich may have tried to resurrect the\nKing of Monsters back in '98, but his efforts failed, and his lack of\nsupport from Toho may have been the cause.

Asides from Godzilla, there\nare also some well developed human characters, who (unlike the '98\nfilm) we actually care about, thanks in part to wonderful performances\nby great actors, especially Bryan Cranston.

Director Gareth Edwards\nand writer Max Borenstein pull out all the stops in this CGI monster\nromp. Like many have said, the cgi in this film just blows my mind.\nGodzilla looks great and is a perfect mesh of old and new. Last Years\nPacific Rim came close, but Godzilla is the perfect way to spend your\ntime at the movies. Is the story perfect? no, but it hits the right\nnotes and Edwards taking his play book from Spielberg and Jaws teases\nus just right until the big showdown at the end. Actor Bryan Cranston\nhelps the material shine even more with his appearance at the\nbeginning. I wished he had more screen time, but Ken Watanabe is also\nthere to help out.

{"review": "\nGodzilla was a fairly decent film but it had so much unfulfilled\npotential. The first flaw in the film is that the protagonist of the\nfilm was a miserable fail because Aaron Taylor-Johnson simply cannot\nact. Sure, he did great in Kick-Ass but the reality is that those films\nare more silly in nature. Godzilla required him to deliver a few scenes\nthat were more serious and emotional and he simply couldn't do it.\nMaking his lack of acting chops even more apparent was the incredible\nacting of Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen. The other fail in the\nfilm was that they tried to artificially manufacture drama in order to\nadd intrigue. All those things did was take away from the film.\nHonestly, I feel that this movie would've been so much better if it was\nabout 30 minutes shorter. Johnson's lack of acting ability wouldn't\nhave been so pronounced and the ridiculousness of the unrealistic drama\nwouldn't have existed. Those two adjustments and now we have a\nlegitimately awesome Godzilla film.\n"},

This\nmovie is a pseudo love story that constantly takes you away from the\naction to watch a less interesting love story between unremarkable\ncharacters that the movie creators didn't deem important enough to be\nin the majority of trailers.

It just does not live up to the trailers\nor even that funny car commercial that are strangely more entertaining\nthan the film itself?\n"},
{"review": "\nIt has been one of the big challenges for 'Hollywood' in recent decades\nto make a truly epic 'Godzilla' movie. They can make huge disaster\nmovies, with multi-million dollar budgets and an all star cast yet when\nit comes to this Japanese legend, nothing seems to work. The previous\nattempt in 1998, was heavily criticised yet was a decent movie with a\ngood cast. Now we have this modern day hugely hyped up monster movie\nwhich only offers more of the same. The film seems to follow an over\ncomplicated story line which fails to convince and as you wait for\n'Him' to finally appear, it's lost in overly long action sequences and\npoor dialogue. The only plus is 'Elisabeth Olsen' who like most female\nleads in disaster movies, is under used. I never go into a movie\nbelieving the hype or buying into a pre-conceived idea of what it is\ngoing to be. I just watch it as a movie comparing it to my expectations\nbased on the genre. Sadly what we have here is no more than an over\nglamorised B-rate movie with a big budget and a legend it fails to live\nupto!!!!\n"},

{"review": "\nThe movie starts out with an interesting opening credits and Godzilla\ntheme. Already, my Godzilla hype had begun. The heartbreaking opening\nwas an interesting direction for a movie that had seemed to ignore that\nstoryline completely, and a little waste of Cranston if you ask me.\nHowever the movie picked up quickly, and boy was it a fun ride! The\nvisuals were just amazing to watch. The 3D isn't necessary but if you\nhave a few bucks, go ahead. The human element as read by previous\nreviews, did indeed lack. The biggest peeve I had about the movie was\nthat the big man himself (Godzilla) didn't show up until the last about\nhalf an hour and the teasings of him only made it excruciating to wait.\nWhen Godzilla came, my mind was blown by awesomeness. It made my\ninsides into that of a 5-year old. Anyway in the end I give it a 8/10\nand I would recommend you to watch it and if you can, in Imax 3D.\n"},
{"review": "\nGodzilla is clearly the main character of this movie, which is a\nwelcome change from 1990s Godzilla version. Although you don't see much\nof Godzilla, there is a big payoff with the climax. The movie had a\nmuch darker atmosphere that was reminiscent of War of the Worlds with a\nlot of ash and grey skies. The Halo jump scene had a gritty sense of\nrealism that was one of the standout scenes. I also liked how the movie\ndidn't mimic King Kong in one of the major scenes, when it could have\neasily done so. Rather it handled that scene in a much more enjoyable\nmanner. A minor criticism of this movie was that the rest of the acting\nwas not up to par of Cranston. Other parts of it, like the train scene,\nfelt very reminiscent of Battle LA.\n"},
{"review": "\nA fun ride through and through. A clear improvement on the American\nfranchise of Godzilla. The plot is very well outlined with not only our\ngiant lizard friend, but also tell the story of a Naval Bomb Disposer,\nand his journey to get back to his family. The acting, while not the\ngreatest ever seen, was well portrayed.<br><br>It was quite the wait through the first thirty minutes of the movie. It\nwas very well worth the wait. The suspense is built up until the\nbursting point, and it was paid off with a show that could only be\ndescribed as devastating in a wonderful way. Godzilla is a commanding\npresence as he should be. This time, they got his character design\ncorrect, as well as his character as a whole. <br><br>While their sequencing can lack here and there, the movie does very\nwell in its payoff. The human tale is very gripping entertainment, but\nit is augmented by the presence of a true King of the Monsters.\nDefinitely a great start, now on to the next!\n"},
{"review": "\nWow this film is by far the best Godzilla film ever made.

Definitely\nmuch better than the '86 version which had Mathew Broderick in it. This\none seems way more authentic.<br><br>It almost feels like the reviews on here are generated by haters rather\nthan fans.

Well,\nlow and behold the AFI theater in town showed the original with\nsubtitles this spring and I saw it! I was surprised how serious it was\nand also how GOOD! I so enjoyed it. I really don't think I would have\nreceived all the punches of the new Godzilla movie if I had not seen\nthe old one, I feel like almost a prerequisite.

{"review": "\nThis was an excellent reintroduction of the Godzilla character, and an\nexcellent movie in general. It was definitely a lot different compared\nto what I was expecting. That's for sure.

This is my new favorite incarnation of Godzilla: a dark\nguardian protecting the balance of nature, no matter the cost. The\nspecial effects are fantastic. The acting is good.

{"review": "\nNow, don't get me wrong, Godzilla (2014) was a good movie. It did what\nit was suppose to do BUT, I do have some issues with it starting with\nBryan Cranston's lack of screen time.

He had the least screen time out of all the other actors.<br><br>Also, for a movie called \"Godzilla\", you really don't see Godzilla a\nwhole lot. I take it back, Bryan Cranston had more screen time than\nGodzilla. Nonetheless, Godzilla (2014) was AMAZINGLY better than the\n1998 adaptation. And I have to give credit, where credit is due, Gareth\nEdwards managed to bring back an iconic feature from the old Godzilla\nfilms, something the '98 disaster failed horribly to do. <br><br>Overall, good entertaining movie.

I had to laugh, did he/she not watch any\nGodzilla shows in the 70's? lol. Well, it was the perfect ending as it\nwas just like the films of old.<br><br>I think the film starts out kind of slow.I do understand the need for\nsome of the back story, but I think they could have cut out some of it.\nBut, once the action started up again, it got very exciting.<br><br>One person said Godzilla was badass in this film. I disagree with his\nassessment. He kind of reminded me of Rocky. But he is the good guy and\nhe won in the end. I wanted him to be more of a badass than he was, but\nhopefully the sequel will bring him back stronger than ever.<br><br>All in all, if you are a lifelong Godzilla fan, this movie is for you!!\nAnd also if you can, see it in 3D!\n"},

{"review": "\nThis movie could have been really fun. The first 25 minutes were\nwonderful to behold and throughout there were many instances of eerily\nbeautiful imagery. The fundamental ridiculousness of Godzilla is the\nmain issue. A warder of the planet destroying ancient entities that\nharm the planet...needs another form. The film was so full of\npretentious cinematic clich\u00e9s, over indulgent militarism (are you\nreally going to semi-auto weapons to hurt a monster 10 stories tall?),\nand battle scenes so poorly designed (one would think of an old sci-fi\nflick 'The Deadly Mantis'), that the start may have been the best part\nof this ride.

{"review": "\nToo much irrelevant dialogue/drama. There are shows/movies that have\ngood dialogue &amp; drama, but those are actually relevant to the theme of\nthose shows/movies.
