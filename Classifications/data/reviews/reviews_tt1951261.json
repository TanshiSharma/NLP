{"review": "\nI'm not going to sugar coat it: this movie stinks. After the\ngut-busting hilarity of the 2009 original, this comedy franchise has\nbeen struck down with a severe case of sequel-itis. The carbon-copy\nsecond instalment was stale for the most part yet still managed a\nhandful of laughs thanks to the general funniness of Zach Galifianakis'\nsocially demented Alan; this episode however, is almost completely\ndevoid of humour. The writing has become increasingly reliant on the\nnatural charisma of the headlining star trio - with the plot here being\nlaborious and woefully lazy - and the irritating Chow (Ken Jeong), the\nweakest link in part one, inexplicably gets even more screen time to\nscreech and make our eardrums bleed. If it weren't for an amusing set\npiece atop Las Vegas' Caesar Palace hotel and a best-for-last gag\nduring the end credits, I would've given this the one star treatment. I\nwas desperately hoping this series would regain some form and finish\nwith a bang, but unfortunately the wolf-pack's last adventure barely\nmakes a whimper.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is NOT a comedy in any way shape or form. It takes the characters\nfrom the first two films to a dark conclusion but absolutely none of it\nwas fun or funny in any way. It's not just expectations talking because\nI watched it with lowered expectations. That's not to say it's\ncompletely uninteresting because somehow you care what happens to these\nguys even though the story presented here is very shallow.<br><br>I honestly didn't laugh even once until after the conclusion. Even\nthen, a few minor chuckles at best (the pants/\"pornographie\" actions\nand comment) and the after credits stuff is mildly amusing. This was a\nvery strange way to end a trilogy that started with what I found to be\ncomedy gold.\n"},

Its hard for me to believe Cooper and Helms agreed to\nparticipate in this abomination.<br><br>Trouble with this film is its for a 12 or 13 year old, but you need to\nbe 17 to get in and see it. Also the few chuckles in the audience\nsounded like they were from a 79 - 80 IQ patron.<br><br>If you are a 40 year old adolescent or have a room temp IQ you may find\nthis amusing. A level beneath fart jokes, this expletive laden\nnon-script couldn't give anyone a chance to act even if they had the\nskills.<br><br>I wish I'd have spent the 90 minutes reorganizing my garage or deleting\nold emails - and I'm not kidding at all.

{"review": "\nDid The Hangover Part 2 need to be made? No is the answer to that\nquestion, definitely not. Did The Hangover Part 3 need to be made? Well\nthey went ahead and made the second one so I guess they had to make\nthis one really. And while it wasn't The Hangover film I was hoping\nfor, it's still a fitting finale to the trilogy.<br><br>So is the film funny I hear you cry...well kind of. Some of the jokes\nfall disastrously flat but the ones that work really do work. And as\nyou'd expect, most of the humor is contributed by Zach Galifianakis as\nthe ever eccentric Alan and Ken Jeong as the man of sheer chaos, Leslie\nChow. Forget Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms' characters, Alan and Mr Chow\nare the stars of this show. Which was to be expected as the whole film\nis built around their exploits and curiously strange friendship.<br><br>So is this better than the second installment? Yes it is. Is it better\nthan the original? Nowhere near. But you'll still have a great time if\nyou're a fan of the franchise in general. The film's main set piece at\nCaesars Palace is worth the ticket price alone.\n"},
{"review": "\nI decided to go and see this film as I am a fan of the first film in\nthe franchise - the second was not enjoyable, but I had hoped the\nconclusion would be a return to form. I was hugely disappointed by the\nlazy script, cruel tasteless gags, and the predictability of the film.\nI love comedies, I have a sense of humour, but I only laughed once or\ntwice. The cruel animal death 'jokes' killed the mood of the film. They\nwere cheap and quite shocking. I know these films are supposed to be\nshocking, but it is not clever or witty to make jokes out of serious\nissues like cockfighting - I didn't want to watch a rooster get slowly\nsmothered by an imbecilic Asian man. I wanted to enjoy a fun experience\nlike I did with the first Hangover film. Mr Chow is a hugely\nirritating, monotonous character, whose only purpose seems to be to\nhurl out nonsense at every opportunity. The Hangover Part III will ruin\nthe experience of the first film for you - if you want a film that is\noriginal, and good fun - avoid this shameless grab for cash. I can\nhonestly say this was a chore to watch. 1/10\n"},

Worst of all, No One was Hungover! How can you name a movie\nthe hangover, when it involves no drinking, stupidity or a hangover?\nthe only part i can honestly say i loved was the short after wedding\nskit after the credits. THAT is the movie i wanted to watch, along with\neveryone else in the cinema from what everyone started screaming at the\nscreen.

{"review": "\nWhere do I begin...I am not a harsh critique but I am also not the\naverage movie goer, so here is my take on Hangover 3, which I believe\nmost who see it will agree was sloppy, rushed, and in-genuine. <br><br>The actors hearts, chemistry, and drive were not into it. Phil's lines\ncame out forced and a bit off timing, Stu didn't have much to work\nwith, and Alan's character development was probably the only thing that\nkept the movie trucking along. Funny? Sure, but not as funny as 1 OR 2,\nyes even 2. Don't get me wrong there were plenty of 2 second laughs,\nbut nothing like the 1st or even 2nd film. It was all just so wrong. <br><br>The end credit scene is something I wished had been the first scene of\nthe film, which I have seen others express as well. Btw, where was Mike\nTyson?

They've also put too much emphasis on the\nsuspense portion of the plot (an it's not particularly suspenseful at\nthat). Alan's character moves from being that of a naive innocent to\nsomething far crueler and darker, which I didn't enjoy either.

Even though it being\ncalled hangover, and there being no hangover in it (except the end) it\nwas awesome. I loved that Leslie how was more of a major character in\nthis! He's so funny! I think this movie was a good closure to the\nseries, but I still think that the first one was the best, the other\ntwo are still very good and amusing. I would have been disappointed if\nthey haven't made one more, so now I am content. They also provided\nclosure the the story of Alan, which I think was really necessary and\nit was a happy ending. :)\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Hangover Part Three is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly\nthrilling storyline that is a lot more serious and dark than the\nprevious installments.It definitely wasn't as good as the first,but I\nthought it was a huge improvement from the second,mainly because it\ndidn't follow the same formula as the previous two,I don't understand\nwhy the movie got negative reviews,I was very pleased and thought it\nwas a brilliant farewell to these characters I've loved since 2009,they\nwrapped up a lot of loose ends and I really loved that.The cast are as\ngood as ever,and I think the best performance goes to John Goodman,his\ncharacter was scary and very intimidating,an almost Oscar worthy\nperformance.Fans of the previous two Hangover's will definitely be\nhappy with this final farewell,but if your like me,your gonna wish\nthere was more,id be happy with another three movies,thats how much I\nlove these characters.<br><br>When Doug is kidnapped by a man who Leslie Chow stole gold\nfrom,Phil,Stu and Alan must find Chow in order to save Doug's life.\n"},

I really loved the movie. I\nwatched the movie and I wasn't really expecting it to be good because\nlets face it every sequel on earth is the same as the first one. what\nmakes a sequel ? a great movie , a great idea and when you try to make\nanother one you will always fail to bring the same excitement. maybe\nbecause every one expects to watch a movie just like the first they got\nso disappointed but believe me it's not bad at all.\n"},
{"review": "\nWell, the plot is without any hangover, not so smooth and has less\ntwists, but the run is logical and includes several funny and warm\nmoments. Animal-related scenes are not to everyone's taste, but the\nshare of dirty sex jokes has significantly diminished (in order to\nwiden the audience?).<br><br>As for the cast, the 3rd movie is focused mainly on Zach Galifianakis'\ncharacter Alan Garner (ZG outperforms all his co-stars); Ken Jeong as\nLeslie Chow and John Goodman as Marshall provide catchy performances as\nwell. The other characters are less elaborated and even a splendid\nactor like Bradley Cooper has to strain to the utmost. Female\ncharacters are sketchy and nothing special, they appear seldom on the\nscreen.<br><br>If you at least tolerated Hangover I and Hangover II, then you could\nwatch the final series as well as it rounds up the trilogy in a nice\nmanner.\n"},
{"review": "\nSo this has been panned by nearly every critic and I can see why. If\nyour a critic and you see every film that comes out a year, you'll\nprobably find this unoriginal, not funny and boring. Which is fine but\nif your fan you will most likely enjoy this more. In this case I was a\nfan of the first film, I kinda liked the 2nd and this one was also\nokay. <br><br>So I thought this was better than the 2nd. (Not by a huge margin) It\nhas its laughs consistently, but they were small laughs, almost\ngiggles. Just enough to keep you entertained. The film was pretty much\nabout Chow and Alan. If you like those two characters then it makes it\neasier to enjoy the film.<br><br>There's just not much to say about this film, there nothing much wrong\nwith it, expect just being a mediocre film. So Id recommend just\nwaiting for a DVD/Br purchase of this film. <br><br>My overall rating is.<br><br>3/5 Stars.\n"},

The\nmovie is a total disappointment. A thin story, hardly any original\nmoments. A classical example of making some money based on the success\nbefore. It looks like that even Mike Tyson was not performing on stage\nto save some money. Lets keep the memories off the wolf pack based on\nno 1 and 2.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have to say after the second movie (which was in essence the first\nmovie in every way but just a different setting) I wasn't even planning\nto see this at the cinema.

It's an uncomfortable a watch as ever and the\ncharacters do really seem to have come in to their own. I think time\nwise it's the perfect length and I didn't find myself clock watching as\nsometimes happens when this type of film. If you do see this film as\nwith all the others make sure you stay till the end credits as there is\na little treat for everyone.

{"review": "\nNone of the three Hangover movies have been spectacular, but the two\nfirst ones were quite amusing. The Hangover part III however, is\nanother story.

The part about\nthe giraf could have been funny, if it hadn't been used in ever SINGLE\nadvertisement for the hangover!. However the plot does develop, just\nnot into anything good. The whole concept of hangover, and the feeling\nof \"shit, that's happened to me\" does not apply to this movie at all.\nThere is nothing anyone can related to, unless they have been involved\nwith gang-people ofc. I know I laughed three times during the movie,\nonce it was actually genuinely funny, and the other times I laughed\nbecause I felt stupid having wasted so much money watching this movie.\nIt is simply just a fail. However, based on the ending of the movie,\nthere is potential for a 4th one, but the 3rd one should never have\nbeen made. It dragged on, had little funny content, and the actors\nseemed bored as well.\n"},
{"review": "\nFrom hangover 1 to 3, it is a constant downward graph of entertainment.\nI loved the first movie and somehow accepted the second as an average\nbut this is truly a disgrace. The storyline was very weak, although\nacting was good but that was not enough. The plot was too stupid and\nshort, hard to believe that it came from same brilliant minds who made\nthe first movie. It seemed like everyone in this movie were forced to\nwork on this project. <br><br>Although there were some funny moments by Zach, who was the main\ncharacter in this movie. Other characters like Bradely and Helms were\nmerely a supporting cast in this movie. Everyone can easily skip this\nmovie and watch the first Hangover movie again!\n"},

Yes, the first two films\ndid well in the box-office so the third part was inevitable but it's\nnot an excuse for this film being such a lifeless comedy. There is no\ndrive, no epicness that were in parts 1 &amp; 2. The Wolf Pack look tired\nand absolutely not interested in being in this film, some other\ncharacters appear just to show a familiar face and don't have memorable\nscenes and the storyline feels superficial and concocted out of thin\nair.

The plot\nwas pretty stupid and the whole film is pretty much only based on only\n2 characters, Alan,played by Zach Galifianakis and Mr Chow, played by\nKen Jeong, making the others rather forgettable.<br><br>Overall..

They also ruin the character\nAlan in this movie, which I thought would have been an impossible job\nbut they managed to do it. He comes over, yes as a retard, but also as\nan ass and a character that I loved in the first two movies I now\ndislike in this film. The only good thing about this film was the plot\nline. I thought the plot was actually stronger than the other two\nmovies and I know I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it had any\nfunny bits at all.

I couldn't stop\nLOLling at some times (the tiger moments are at my TOP10 for comedies).\nI stopped the 2nd film after 10 minutes from the start: it just seemed\na bad cover of the first one; I just could not watch it. I succeeded\nwatching all this 3rd installment and I have to say that you should\nwatch it just if you feel you'd like the story to go on. The story in\nfact goes on: there're new elements, there's some little fun and\nthere's some action. But in the end there are 2 sceneries:<br><br>1) You didn't watch the series: then you won't like the film overall\nsince it's just an average action/comedy linked to previous\ninstallments that you won't enjoy since it recalls a lot of previous\nepisodes. 2) You watched the series: then you won't find the hilarious\nmoments of the first HANGOVER (in the second I expect you won't find\nany).<br><br>Oh forgot another scenery...<br><br>3) You watched the series and you care for the characters: my advice is\nto watch it and then... rehab maybe...<br><br>4,5 to 5.

The Hangover 3 is a fun romp with the characters we've\nall come to know from the first two Hangover movies. There is no\nhangover in this film, which is what sets it apart. What you get is\nAlan, Stuart, and Phill getting hit, put into \"oh Sh!t\" moments, goofy\ndialog, and Chow being a drug addicted jerk. It moved well, the\ncharacters are goof balls, and the only reason people are complaining\nis because they wanted to complain in the first place.
