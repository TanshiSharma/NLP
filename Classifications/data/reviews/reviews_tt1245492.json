{"review": "\nI feel like I saw a different movie than everyone else. It's simply not\nfunny, I think I laughed once. We really don't need to see a erect,\ngiant, detailed, graphic phallus in every movie, it's not funny. Then\nto have to sit through an extended portion of Satan walking around with\nhis junk out is not funny and not needed. I'm not prudish but this\nmovie adds male genitals just to do it, it was a lame movie. Write\nsomething creative like 40-year old virgin. This movie was lamer than\nPineapple Express and Your Highness. If you expect the wit of Knocked\nUp, you'll be as disappointed as me. Save your money. <br><br>None of the characters in the film are likable in the least, and they\nare supposed to be playing themselves. I do not know why people are\ntreating Seth Rogen like he is incapable of mailing it in because This\nIs The End is lazy and feels like it was mailed in to fulfill an\nobligation to the movie studio. I also feel cheated by the excellent\nreviews this movie received from the paid critics. How did anyone find\nthis trash funny?\n"},
{"review": "\nI thoroughly enjoyed the film, though in retrospect, I am not sure if\nit is really a great film--there's not much to compare it to. One\nthing's for certain: this film is not \"just like\" any other film you\ncould name. It is one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a\nwhile. And I am probably going to miss the Rapture as a result of my\nenjoyment.<br><br>The film has graphic sex talk and graphic violence. The dialog could\nhardly be any nastier. And of course, hardly more sacrilegious.\nHowever, despite all of that, the film is surprisingly good-natured.<br><br>This is not a film for children or for family viewing. Anyone who is\nsqueamish or easily offended should stay away.<br><br>And don't automatically assume that anyone over 40 would not like this\nfilm. I'm over 60; I had a great time.

{"review": "\nIf you've seen Superbad, Pineapple Express, etc., then you know the\ntype of humor this movie will have. I, for one, could watch James\nFranco, Seth Rogan, and Danny McBride leisurely eat a sandwich and\nmanage to laugh my butt off. Thankfully this movie is much more\nexciting than that. It's brilliant that they all just play themselves\nand manage to poke fun at their own lifestyles. Expect weed and drug\nhumor of course. The plot sets itself up for hilarity, as they all take\nrefuge in James Franco's fortress of a mansion while the world outside\nthem goes up in flames. Cabin fever mixed with dwindling supplies\nresults in hilarious situations and good one liners. <br><br>The movie made me laugh extremely hard and had all my favorite people\nin one film.

{"review": "\nThis was without a doubt one of the most disappointing movies I went to\nin 2013 and I go to a lot of movies. I saw the previews and like the\nfact that Seth and his buddies were going to play themselves.

It was also a movie with a lot\nof blood and some of the writing just looked like they were smoking pot\nwhen putting this together.

It is a very\nclever and entertaining comedy, with hilarious and dirty dialogues. I\ndo have to admit, however, that the storyline can feel a little bit too\nridiculous from time to time, even for this kind of movie. The acting\nin the movie was not that spectacular, but the actors involved were all\nborn for this kind of movie.<br><br>For anyone who can truly appreciate a hilarious movie which is made\nspecifically to humor and entertain people, and has no other hidden\nagenda whatsoever, this is definitely a must watch.\n"},

I feel completely\nand utterly duped. The reviews said it was great overall, I wonder what\nhas happened to society when an entire scene dedicated to an argument\nabout masturbating on a magazine is funny.

I am guessing the crass jokes and crude humor were\nto draw in the younger crowd.

{"review": "\nusually we ask how awful can it be? well it is the worst movie i have\nwatched in terms of comedy so far. did not laugh till the end. and at\nthe end you start laughing cause you have waited so long so a laugh. i\nthink the ones who are laughing are people like Seth rogen and Jonah\nhill. i know weed is good and all that, but i wouldn't make a movie out\nof a weed nightmare. stamp it with all the good names. and sell it to\nthe public to make some money. shame on all the actors like James\nFranco Michael cera Emma Watson. all the sh...ty memories of this movie\nwill haunt you in your future works. and it should cause you made us\nsuffer.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was exactly what I expected and more. Filling it with dirty\njokes, weed, cameos, the apocalypse, religion, demonic possession, and\nmuch more. The idea and plot of actors playing themselves is unique and\nfresh. During a party at James Franco's house, the world begins to\ncrumble. Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, Jay\nBaruchel, and James Franco all try to survive the apocalypse, and most\nimportantly, try to survive from each other. From making a home-made\nsequel to 'The Pineapple Express' to getting high and listening to that\nridiculous Gangnam Style song, this movie has a little bit of\neverything. I highly recommend THIS IS THE END!!!\n"},

{"review": "\nAnyone notice how mediocre, creative-less movies ALWAYS have the dance\nscenes at the end (usually with an old pop song that used to be\npopular)? <br><br>My theory is they throw in the dance ending to try to have you leave\nthe movie with a good feeling, because they couldn't do it with the\nmovie itself. <br><br>As for this movie, how it is rated so high is beyond me. There were\nfunny moments, but mostly felt mundane. Then the dance at the end just\nconfirmed my gut feeling through out the movie.

How on Earth this movie\never received a 7.2 rating is beyond me. It does confirm one thing,\nthough - people are more asinine (look it up in Google, 10 year olds)\nthan ever. I cannot believe the level of stupidity to which we have\ndescended as a species.<br><br>I rated this movie a 2 only because there are worse movies out there -\nany Adam Sandler movie, for instance.

{"review": "\nI read a few positive results for this movie, and decided to give it a\nchance, especially because it was rated as comedy. I must say the only\nsmile I managed to produce was when the film was over. I guess the\nrelatively high score of this film is because it gets reviewed by\npeople who like this kind of humor. <br><br>For me it was total boredom. It is a mix of adolescent-type movie with\nwarm friendship feelings, reunions, whatever. It starts silly and\nevolves into total nonsense. In summary you spend most of the time with\nthe main characters yelling around because something is burning,\nfalling down, or chasing them. <br><br>Even Eurotrip was more fun than this crap.

While I found about 10\ngags to be genuinely hilarious, most of it was repetitive, vulgar\nsolely for the shock value of being vulgar, and largely incoherent.\nWith the exception of Emma Watson's tongue-in-cheek (on the face, not\non the butt where most of the jokes landed) performance, the acting was\nsub-par for a Seth Rogan flick.

You do wonder if they saw\nthe same film you saw because I'd like them to explain to me what was\nso funny about this mess and why did it have to be so long?

{"review": "\nComing from school of Pineapple Express school of comedy, this is\nanother stoner comedy on a bigger canvas. Directed by Evan Goldberg and\nSeth Rogen, and starring Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah\nHill, Craig Robinson and a host of other actors playing themselves,\nthis is a stoner comedy wrapped in the cloak of disaster and\napocalypse. The above mentioned actors try to survive an apocalyptic\nevent by holing out in Franco's new house. While trying to survive,\ntheir interpersonal relationships come into focus and makes them\nintrospect. There's little significance of actors playing themselves in\nthe movie, apart from adding to the quirkiness of it. The comedy gets\nstale after sometime. The plot and the pace of the movie are its saving\ngraces and keep you hooked to the story, somewhat. Watch it if you are\na fan of Pineapple Express kind of comedy. It is an anti thesis of the\nbig budget, big drama, big action disaster movies Hollywood has on\noffer.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe cast of the movie is epic and they know each other, which can be a\nvital part in the production. <br><br>The plot is simple the world is ending and two best friends are stuck\nat Francos house. <br><br>The acting is good, but a little relaxed and calm. The film has it low\nand high points, but is usually very exiting. Every actor plays as\nthemselves, and i think thats just awesome, it brings the character\nmore together. <br><br>The writing is just casual but no comedy movie is a 10 out of 10. <br><br>Sound effects are both really good or just awful. I feel like Emma W\ndidn't do her part good enough, and she was just having fun. of course\ni believe the cast itself planned all long to have make it kinda joke.\n"},

The plot had a few turns, but it\ndid get back on the subject, there was also a good amount of a\nsupporting cast as well. The movie kept me laughing and entertained\nthroughout the whole movie The only issue I have is this film has a\nlittle religious propaganda, I personally have no problem with that,\nbut I believe it's just not necessary.
