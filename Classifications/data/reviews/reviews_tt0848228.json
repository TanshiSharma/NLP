{"review": "\nI was lucky enough to be included in the group to see the advanced\nscreening in Melbourne on the 15th of April, 2012. And, firstly, I need\nto say a big thank-you to Disney and Marvel Studios.<br><br>Now, the film... how can I even begin to explain how I feel about this\nfilm? It is, as the title of this review says a 'comic book triumph'. I\nwent into the film with very, very high expectations and I was not\ndisappointed.<br><br>Seeing Joss Whedon's direction and envisioning of the film come to life\non the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and\nlaced with sharp wit a humor. The special effects are literally\nmind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and\nbeautifully choreographed.<br><br>While all of these things (script, action, special effects and so on\nand so forth) are important... it's no good having them spot on if you\ndon't have a cast that just isn't right. But fortunately, for fans and\nfor the actors involved, Whedon's cast not only work brilliantly\ntogether but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and\nthreatening each other all day and night.<br><br>The actors' performances in \"Marvel's The Avengers\" are simply\ncaptivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further\ninto their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert Downey Jr.\nwill have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in\ndisbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations. And Tom\nHiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear.<br><br>All in all, Marvel's The Avengers is a visual delight and I cannot wait\nto see it again, and again, and again. Marvel fans will not be\ndisappointed, and something tells me that most of you will agree with\nme wholeheartedly.<br><br>The Avengers, assembled and awe-inspiring. Ten out of ten.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis remarkable movie easily fulfilled and then exceeded all\nexpectations. I've been waiting for this movie since Sam Jackson's\ncharacter uttered those famous words after the first Iron Man film...\nStark now knows he's not the only superhero in his world and it's as\nbig a treat for our real world as it gets. Seeing the \"Avenger\nInitiative\" in action is as great as I would ever have hoped! Hell, who\nam I kidding, I've been waiting to see this movie all my life. Who\nwould've thought years ago that ALL these characters could fit in to a\nfilm and all of them be done justice? It delivers greatness from scene\none and has to be considered the best this genre has EVER produced.\nTruthfully, as good as some of the previous work has been from every\nstudio, nothing else has come close. That's not hyperbole; I really\nthink most will agree if they see it with an open mind. I loved this\nmovie's depth, heart, humor, gravitas, action, performances, emotion\nand payoff. I honestly can't wait to see it again with the rest of the\nworld later. Right now, I'm simply basking in the greatness I just\nwitnessed!\n"},
{"review": "\n'Avengers Assemble' ('The Avengers') is a truly enjoyable superhero\nfilm that lives up to its hype and creates a story that allows for four\nof the greatest superheroes to connect in this mega-blockbuster\nextravaganza. Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed\nMarvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a\ngreat cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven\nspectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the\ncinema in 3D, the film is equally as stunning on an average television\nset, with the final battle between the Avengers and Loki's army being\none of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie. An impressive\nand remarkable fantastical superhero flick from Whedon.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays\ndividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other\nAvenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth\nand texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main\ncharacters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better\ndevelopment. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's\npersonalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from\ncomic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the\naction sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result\nis a film that's just flat out exceptional.<br><br>Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story\naccommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it\nagain with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex\nin this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault\nlines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and.\nAgain, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He\nhas such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have\nsomebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of\nlight, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment\nthreatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he\nhas become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.<br><br>The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an\nadventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing\ntennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely\ndifferent from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such\nspecific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at\ndifferent times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both\ndirector and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to\nstrengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie\nevent.\n"},
{"review": "\nI just loved Marvel's Avengers. I thought it was smart and the\nimpressive cast really delivered! This movie works on so many levels\nand makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember\nwhen I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it\nextra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts\nfrom each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they\nall delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in\nAvengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat.\nExample: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse\nthunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said\nfor every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit,\nit's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what\nmakes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any\nother franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, GI Joe and\neven Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers\nall angles and delivers depth with its fun.<br><br>I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years if not ever!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is an OK film. There are some good things, some awful. But this is\nby far the most overrated movie of all time. Characters The characters\nare good. I didn't attach to them even though I had seen lots of the\nother MCU movies. The performances are good but nothing amazing. RDJ is\ngood as Iron Man but I just don't like the character. I didn't care\nabout any of them and Coulsons death was boring and I didn't care for\nthe character.<br><br>Villain Loki was good but not great as a villain. He is by far a good\nvillain but isn't very threatening which is the main point of the\nvillain. He wasn't even a threat until the Chitauri turned up and they\ncould have been taken down by the army. Plot This is the main reason\nthat this is overrated. It has no plot. It is very simple but still has\nplot holes. The main threat of the movie is actually very easy to take\ndown so the Avengrrs aren't needed whatsoever. They could have been\ndefeated but the army and if they were a threat to the world why didn't\nthey even make it past ONE CITY. Most of the time plot holes are\ncreated by us not thinking right and using common sense but these plot\nholes are gigantic. Summary What I liked: characters, villain, effects\nand action What I disliked: plot, music and villains army. Overall this\nis very overrated and so it gets a: 5.4/10\n"},
{"review": "\nThe avengers. One of the most hyped comic book movies of all time.\nAfter years of build-up with solo movies, the avengers is born. Is it\ngood? does it still hold up? the answer is no. I admit, the first time\ni saw this movie in theaters, i was having a blast and enjoying it very\nmuch. However, the film gets worse for me each time i give it a second\nwatch. The film is centered around Loki(played by Tom Hiddleston), who\nwants to take over the world, while the avengers work out their ways to\nstop him. It is as generic and lazy as it sounds. The film barely has\nany story or even character development/interaction. It's nothing but\none liners and action. None of the characters have a defined\npersonality. Tony Stark is a one dimensional clown, Thor is has the\ncharm of a wood that speaks in a Shakespearean way, black widow and\nhawkeye are nearly the same, only their gender are different. Hulk has\nhis moments, and captain America is one of the most boring comic book\ncharacters i have ever seen in this movie. It's basically a Michael Bay\nmovie minus the women objectifying, but same level of obnoxious and out\ndated film making. One of the most overrated trash movies i have ever\nseen. This movie gets 3/10 from me\n"},
{"review": "\nI wonder when people will understand that they are watching the same\nmovies over and over again with only different heroes... Even without\nwatching the movie an 8 year old can write a summary of it and it would\nbe 90% accurate. Bla bla bla good guys come together bla bla bla they\nstart up pretty good bla bla bla they argue bla bla bla they reunite\nand kick the villain's ass. How original(!) And this thing applies for\n99% of the Marvel movies and about 80% for DC. And there are major\nlogic mistakes also like captain America can protect himself from\nenemies with a shield not bigger than a large plate. I know it's a\nsuper hero movie but, really?It's like bad guys are not even trying. No\nneed to talk about Black Widow... Use your minds people!\n"},
{"review": "\n*Spoilers*<br><br>Just when Comic book films were truly starting to enjoy a time of true\nartistic relevance and seemed to be on the verge of officially casting\noff the shackles of stereotypes and bias that have plagued the genre\nfor decades, along comes a film to firmly entrench it in every single\nhackneyed clich\u00e9 and trope that have been the deservedly derided by the\neducated community.<br><br>The Avengers is, by far, the most uninspired CBM story I've seen from\nthe CBM genre to date, disguised by draping a cheap, easily exploitable\ncrossover gimmick over it, not so dissimilar to the various other\npoorly conceived amalgamations that have been presented to us over the\nyears in various mediums (Cartoon All Stars, AVP, Freddy v Jason, and,\nmost recently, Dawn of Justice).<br><br>Poorly executed, nonsensical characterization (\"i'm Always Angry\",\nbasically the 2012 version of \"Your mother's name is Martha too?\"),\nforced interactions and stock 'argument' dialogue (We're not a team,\nwe're a time bomb.\", subtle.), and a total lack of dramatic heft give a\nvery light (story-wise, not tone), one-note, TV episodic feeling to\nwhat should have been a complex, multi- layered epic.<br><br>Overall, a conglomeration of \"fanboy\" moments vainly stitched together\nto attempt some sort of narrative.\n"},

Oh yes,\nthey are morons. Its the only sensible conclusion to draw. How anyone\ncan rate this movie amongst the pantheon of great titles is beyond me.<br><br>So trying to find something constructive to say about this title is\nhard...I enjoyed Iron Man?

{"review": "\nA couple of chuckles from the one liners, action scenes that went on\ntoo long, and a predictable and inevitable ending. It was okay and easy\nwatching to pass a Friday evening, just don't expect too much from it -\nchallenging and a fine work of art it isn't, a bit of fun it is.\nHiddleston made a fine villain and the other characters performed as\nexpected,i.e. not everyone is going to get an Oscar for best actor no\nmatter how many films they make, some of the hook and line dialogue was\nspoken as if they were bored, perhaps they were.

{"review": "\nThe avengers is a classic marvel movie full of action, stunning special\neffects and the odd bit of funny humour.

I can't find any flaws in\nthis movie , it kinda has everything you need in a good movie:action,\ncomedy, cool quotes and stunning special effects. I also love how\nmarvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed.\nThe casting choices were also great. Everyone fits perfectly as the\ncharacter they were chosen to play. Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron\nMan and Scarlett Johannson is amazing as Black Widow. My favourite is\nSamuel L Jackson as the tough but amazing Nick Fury. All in all WATCH\nTHIS FILM.\n"},
{"review": "\nTHE GOOD- I was truly impressed with how well they pulled this movie\noff. The visual effects were all very clean. The characters were\nportrayed by the actors very well. This movie was loaded with action\nkeeping everyone's attention glued to it. I was so impressed, I went to\nthe theater to see it more than once and recommended it to everyone. I\nwas very happy to see most of the actors return to portray their\ncharacters in this. THE BAD- Most characters.... The hulk was my big\nissue here. Mark Rufflo was good with the Bruce Banner character but\nthe graphics for the hulk just did not meet the level of the movie\nstarring Edward Norton. But it was not so bad that I could not look\npast it and really find enjoyment. I will most definitely go see\nanother installment of Avengers.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie is certainly marvel's best till now and has great effects.\nThough little childish at times it is very good. As I expected it was\none of the best films with descent, comedy parts. The acting was above\naverage and the dialogues were really mind-boggling. It was a bit\nlengthy but was touching every single minute. The story was very good\nand the superhero's were described nicely. Bruce Banner very polite\nwhen he was not Hulk, Captain America very serious and all that. It was\ndefiantly worth watching and is one of the best superhero films. I am\nlooking ford for the Avengers 2 and I am searching the whole internet\nfor a little glimpse of it.\n"},
{"review": "\nLoved this movie, even at almost 3 hours long it didn't drag. Joss\nWheddon (Firefly and Buffy) effortlessly out did all of the battle\nscenes in every Transformer movie with the climatic showdown. there are\neven two or three seriously laugh out loud moments, mostly concerning\nThe Hulk, but don't worry the film takes itself fairly seriously so you\ncan escape into the story and immerse yourself.<br><br>Fans of Ironman, Thor and Captain America will not be disappointed.\nEvery one of the superheroes gets their moment in the sun. And of\ncourse, there's Scarlett's character Black Widow. YUM! I'm giving the\nmovie 10/10 (2D HD version) because it's so entertaining and it\nfulfilled all my expectations. You won't be disappointed.<br><br>As far as the format goes though, stick with HD, there wasn't any real\n3D moments. If you are hugely into your 3D experience, think twice\nbefore paying the extra, there wasn't any stand out 3D moments, but\nlots of out of focus backgrounds which kinda wasted the small fortune\nthat must have been spent on production. Go HD you'll get a better\nexperience.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'll admit it, I was extremely doubtful about this film. I've loved\nJoss Whedon's work my entire life and I had enjoyed all the previous\nMarvel films that led up to this one, especially Iron Man. But the fact\nthat they brought together all of these different characters from all\nthese different movies and put them together in 2 1/2 hour film was\nunprecedented and almost seemed impossible. But the optimist in me got\nme to the theater with me expectations shaky. Once the film started I\nwas quickly drawn in and once the title appeared on the screen I knew\nthat Joss Whedon had done it. The Avengers is without a doubt my\nfavorite Marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made. Whedon\ndid a great job writing this masterful, witty script that ingeniously\nput together all these characters and made it flow perfectly. The\nactors did such a great job playing these characters again and it\ndidn't seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got a chance to\nbe in the spotlight(especially the hulk). Once you see all of the\ncharacters assemble and fight the bad guys you can't help but fill with\nhappiness. The entire movie was such a fun thrill ride from the\nbeginning to the end and the ending battle scene was brilliantly done.\nI am extremely delighted to say that Joss Whedon has done the\nimpossible and made one of the most entertaining movies ever made.\n"},

{"review": "\n\"The Avengers\" brings together a group of extremely talented actors and\nepic superheroes, to create an action packed movie with hilarious\nbanter laced into countless scenes. Superhero movies give actors a\nchance to play new characters with personalities they have never\nportrayed before. Chris Evans is the extremely passionate and kind\nhearted Captain America, while Robert Downey Jr is the tougher and\nsassier Iron Man. The film is very creative with introducing each\ncharacter and later bringing them together. The villain, Loki\nLaufeyson, played by Tom Hiddleston, even shows his weak spots and is\nalmost seen as part of the Avengers team. The actors have fantastic\nchemistry with each other on and off screen, and they make man- tights\nand capes look more fashionable than ever. The majority of the film is\ndone by special effects, made by an amazing team. They transform New\nYork City into a place for heroes, placing Tony Stark's towering house\nin the middle of the city. Even at the end of the film, the\nunsuspecting Tony Stark is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of\neveryone else.

Although in fairness once\nthis story starts to move in the second hour, it MOVES.<br><br>By my third viewing I could see the issue. I grew up with these\ncharacters and I had expectations. The expectations were incorrect, I\nnow know, because those expectations were the reason the Marvel library\nwas such a mess before the arrival of the Whedon Bros.<br><br>So what Joss did was analyzed what was not working in past Marvel films\nthen de-constructed the Avengers story, then build a film which could\nact as a base for future sequels, wit ha solid foundation.<br><br>And wrote a script to die for.

{"review": "\nIt may be mildly entertaining, but it's still just other very long and\nslow mix of tired battle scenes and some wooden, masturbatory,\nborderline cringe-worthy dialogue, all leading to a predictable ending.\nThere were a couple good laughs but that doesn't really make up for the\nfact that this was over two hours and twenty minutes. Robert Downey,\nJr. was the best part because his sarcasm is great. It's too bad I\ncan't really say much about the rest. And keep in mind, I genuinely\nlike the Iron Man movies and Captain America.<br><br>Here, everyone's already established and undefeatable. What's the point\nof having characters that you can't root for, and therefore you don't\ncare about the outcome? They never hit rock bottom, therefore there's\nno end to the second act, therefore the whole film is completely\nunsatisfying. And again, it's boring. Two and a half hours leading to\nan obligatorily happy and sequel-welcoming ending. Dear Lord, change it\nup.<br><br>Why was The Dark Knight Trilogy good? Because it had human characters\nthat had legitimate weaknesses, therefore carrying on the plot that had\nthe characters grow, and if they died, we felt sad. Why? Because we\ncared for them. Why did we feel bad for James Bond in Casino Royale? We\nbelieved he loved Vesper and the third act was made with an emotional\npunch. Why did we care for Silva in Skyfall? He was a great villain\nbecause he was funny, menacing, fantastically portrayed by Javier\nBardem, and his motives had a believable character background.

If you\nknow anything about any of these comic book heroes then I'm sure you\ndidn't need to see any movies such as the Iron Man trilogy, Thor,\nCaptain America, or the Hulk to understand this film... But having seen\nall of those leading up to the avengers is what made this movie\nincredible, the investment and work put in by everyone just amazes me.\nKeep up the good work marvel!\n"},

{"review": "\nWhen I watched Iron Man 2, Captain America: The first Avenger, Thor, I\nwished I could see them together in a single movie. But to me it seemed\nimpossible at that time until 2012 when I was marveled to see the\ntrailer of the Avengers. As I watched the movie, it was a dream come\ntrue. The reason it seemed impossible to me was that its hard to\naccommodate so many signature heroes in a single 2.5 hour movie, but\nMarvel did a really amazing job. First off all the movie is a sequel to\n4 or 6 movies (Hulk (2003) and Iron man if you want to add),and is\nprequel to 3+ movies plus a TV series. Second Marvel delivered very\nwell. Every hero was at first a sole hero but gradually they ended\nbeing a team. Every hero had his own story plus a part in the team. How\nthe team came together was also so heartwarming and how they helped\neach other. Every hero was greatly portrayed with great graphics, loads\nof action,comedy,thrill, and a great feast for comic fans and non-comic\nfans both.\n"},

The Avengers does not fall short of anything. Stunts,\nstory, performances, humour, just everything in the right proportion.\nHumour is in abundance but no way does it make the film spoof-like. You\nfeel for the characters, which makes the film a roller coaster ride you\ndon't want to miss out on!

With the original cast of each character are in this movie,\nexcept they did not use the original actor for the Hulk which is what I\nwas familiar with but the part was very well portrayed by Mark Raffalo\n.

Other characters in this film include the fantastic\nperformance of Chris Evans as Captain America. With his honor and loyal\ntraits this character is incredibly brought to the screens with a\nperfect actor that does its great justice. <br><br>All the characters in this film are portrayed wonderfully to bring this\nfantasy film to life. This movie also shows the truth of a community in\na tragedy.

This is film each actor feeds each other\nin this film that all the scenes connect perfectly and even if you have\nnot seen all the individual movies of all the characters one by one.\nThe film is still pretty easy to follow and to catch up on each one and\nthe part they play.

{"review": "\nWhat can I say about the Avengers that everyone else hasn't already\nsaid? Well, believe the hype! it's great! why? well numerous reasons.\nOne of them is the director they chose for the job of bringing one of\nthe most iconic super teams in comics to life.Joss Whedon has showed\ntime and time again that he knows about both the Marvel Universe (see\nhis run on Astonishing X-men) and Team dynamics(See Firefly or any of\nhis other works)and he works his magic to the max here. another reason\nis the great cast. while all good, two performances really stand out to\nme. The first one is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and the second\none is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. While I enjoyed Ed Norton's Banner, I\nfelt something was missing from him, Likability. Mark Ruffalo had\nLikability. Tom Hiddleston's Loki was a great villain that really had\nthat sinister aura about him and he's better here than he was in Thor.\nAnother Reason is the action. Not only does the final scene have An\nepic battle that rivals Robots trashing Chicago in Transformers 3 (This\nis way cooler) But other great action scenes come throughout the movie.\none of my favorites is the scene at the beginning where Loki steals the\nTesseract/Cosmic Cube and takes down a whole bunch of S.H.I.E.L.D\nagents including Nick Fury and Hawkeye. Also, The plot is fairly\nsimplistic but what really makes this movie shone is the character\ndynamics. So final verdict: possibly the best movie of the summer of\n2012. Assemble and go see it.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have been waiting for an Avengers movie for well over a decade and\nwhen I found out that it was even in the pipeline I was beside myself\nwith excitement.

I have to say that it completely surpassed\nmy expectations and I was amazed throughout the entire movie. <br><br>I attended the screening in 3D and I honestly have no idea why people\nhad anything bad to say about the 3D in this movie as it was quite\nbrilliant. <br><br>For me, the underrated characters in the movie are Black Widow and\nHawkeye. I felt that these characters were portrayed perfectly by\nScarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. I also felt that we have finally\nfound a perfect actor in Mark Ruffalo to play The Hulk. The two actors\nthat have recently played Bruce Banner/The Hulk have been pretty good\nbut both seemed to be lacking in something but I could never put my\nfinger on it. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner\nand The Hulk.<br><br>Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills\nand is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of\ncomedic value and a deal of seriousness. <br><br>I can see exactly why there has been a massive explosion of potential\nMarvel movies in the pipeline and I cannot wait to see what the sequel\ncould bring. I feel that Hawkeye and Black Widow could definitely have\ntheir own movies if not a movie where they are working together. I also\nhope that the people at Marvel and Disney have identified Mark\nRuffalo's great ability to play Bruce Banner/The Hulk in such a great\nway and maybe look into rebooting the entire franchise.<br><br>I would highly recommend this movie across all age ranges as there is\nsomething for everyone.

When I go into a movie, I use six main things\nfor rating a movie....... 1.Is it engaging from the start? 2. Are the\ncharacters interesting? 3. Is the acting good. 4. Are the effects\nquality? 5.

However, the\nstoryline is not something you have not seen or heard before. Actually,\nthere is very little new to the film.

But obviously, with fans of the 80's stars\nin Expendables, it is enough to bring them all on the screen at once.<br><br>What I truly enjoyed in this film was actually a few parts of the\naction.

In film, we like to focus on one\ncharacter, and we like to see that one person change over the course of\nthe movie. It's hard to keep track of multiple characters, which is why\nthe single-hero format works so well. Otherwise we end up with meathead\ncity, like The Expendables. Gross.

{"review": "\nHow can this film be rated 8+. IMHO it was absolutely average. Apart\nfrom Robert Downey's sarcastic/acerbic humour the film's remaining\ncharacters were hampered by a poor plot line and an\ninconsistent/juvenile comic book narrative that's holed below the water\nline by contradictions. Marvel need to look to writers like Garth Ennis\nto see how comics should be done.<br><br>Costumes were embarrassingly bad; Loki's plastic horns and staff,\nCaptain America's camp tights and Thor's spandex.<br><br>Has the IMDb score been artificially inflated, is it a case of the\nEmperor's new clothes, or is it Marvel fan-boys?

{"review": "\nI know a lot of critics and fans loved this movie, but unfortunately,\nthis movie just didn't do anything for me. My first biggest problem\nwith this movie: Mark Ruffalo was HORRIBLE as Bruce Banner! It was like\nhe was sleepwalking through the entire movie! Marvel fired Edward\nNorton, and the best replacement they could find was this guy? Did they\njust pick his name out of a hat? Come on! My second biggest problem\nwith this movie: Captain America gets pushed to the side, and most of\nthe focus is on Iron Man. Why?! Here's a crazy idea: Seeing as how\nCaptain America is the LEADER of the Avengers! Why not give him the\nspotlight? Furthermore, Iron Man and Captain America hardly ever get\nalong in this movie. This wasn't at ALL like it was in the comics! In\nthe comics, Tony Stark deeply admired and respected Steve Rogers. In\nFact, Tony Stark's father, Howard helped create the \"Captain America\"\nprogram. My third biggest problem with this movie: It takes FOREVER for\nthe The Avengers to come together and work as a team. Throughout the\nmovie, all they do is fight most of the time, and occasionally throw in\na corny joke. Can someone please tell me what purpose that serves,\nother than to look cool? If you like generic, run of the mill,\nsuperhero movies, then give this a watch. However, don't expect this\nmovie to be deep and meaningful, because you will be sorely\ndisappointed.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked pretty\ncool, and when the review started coming in I immediately got excited. <br><br>When I finally got to see the movie I realized after the first 20\nminutes that this wasn't the movie I was hoping for. Now let me explain\nwhy.<br><br>I can start off with the script. The script is not good, by adding some\nover-dramatic, cheesy and boring dialogue doesn't make a movie good.\nBut the script isn't terrible, some of the cheesy comments fits with\nthe dialogue and makes you laugh a little. <br><br>But the one thing that is directly terrible with this movie is the\nstory. For those of you who don't know the story, it goes like this;\nThor's evil brother Loki has come to the earth to claim it as his, and\nthen he gets a thing called the Tesseract, and afters that he opens a\nportal so his alien army can enter the earth to take control over it.\nBut then Nick Fury brings together the superhero team called ''The\nAvengers'' to stop him. I don't think it's necessary for me to start\nexplaining why the story is so terrible, most people should understand\nwhy. <br><br>And I know a lot of people have claimed that the film don't need a good\nscript or story because it's so entertaining. Well, I don't agree. The\nfirst 1 and a half hours of the movie is really boring, and I actually\nconsidered leaving the cinema, but then the movie catch up with some\nreally cool and visually stunning scenes. <br><br>Some things in this movie was good, like most of the acting, the CGI\nand some of the dialogue. But overall this is just an average popcorn\nmovie with a superhero flick.\n"},

We were about half way through and I asked her \"Do you\nwant to stay or shall we go?\". I cannot remember a time when I have\never asked her such a question, not even for crappy flick. At the end I\nasked her what she thought? she loved it! I was bemused - I actually\ngot bored. Now don't get me wrong, I love movies.

{"review": "\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have seen this awesome flick twice. I am also putting\nit on my holiday wish list this year so that I can add it to my DVD\ncollection. That is how geeked out I am for this movie. The cast was\nmemorable. Robert Downey Junior was born to play Tony Stark. Mark\nRuffalo excelled as Bruce Banner and even resembled the comic book\nBanner. Scarlet Johansen and Chris Hemsworth made for tasty eye candy\nas Black Widow and Thor respectively. Samuel L. Jackson wows as Nick\nFury. The story was well told by writer/director Joss Whedon. There is\nplenty of humor and action. There is also some tragedy as well in the\nform of the death of S.H.E.I.L.D agent Phil Coulson,played excellently\nby Clark Gregg, at the hands of the villain Loki played chillingly by\nTom Hiddleston.

{"review": "\nWhat an utter disappointment. Expected so much more substance from Joss\nWhedon. With so many great characters w/ great stories, you'd think the\nwriters could have put together a good story. But no--that's not what\nobscenely budgeted films with the sole purpose of setting up a\nfranchise care most about. Everyone's already pointed out all the\nridiculous plot problems, so I'll just say that the writers had NO\nexcuse when there's an entire comic series worth of stories to supply\nall they needed to work things out. A waste of some decent actors and\nlots and lots of money. (Pretty clear that the only moment Samuel\nJackson actually enjoyed was when he got to walk out and blow up one of\nthe jets. He looked bored or in pain for every other mediocre line.) I\nenjoyed most of the witty one-liners...and that's about it. <br><br>Shallow on so many levels...who cares how shiny the CG was or how many\nthings got blown up?

{"review": "\nSince that final clip with Nick Fury and Tony Stark in Iron Man, there\nwas hope that maybe Marvel could really be doing an Avengers movie. 4\nyears later and 4 movies later (Iron Man 2, Hulk, Thor, Captain\nAmerica) and we have Joss Wheddon's Avengers. <br><br>What makes The Avengers so Engaging and Intriguing is the dialogue\nbetween the superheroes. Joss Wheddon should be awarded with an Oscar\nfor the writing and directing of The Avengers. Everyone blended in so\nnaturally and their back and fourth banter made for some good comedy.\nEveryone felt equal from Hawkeye to Hulk. It is so difficult to balance\nthese personalities on screen and I don't think any other director\nbesides Joss would've been able to pull it off the way he did.<br><br>The Action scenes in the Avengers is as Epic as it gets. The last hour\nis like a marathon of awesomeness. Every action sequence in this movie\nwas perfectly executed and each character had their significant\nmoments. <br><br>The cast was phenomenal as usual, but the show-stealer is definitely\nMark Ruffalo. His portrayal of the incredible hulk was spot on. He was\nwildly entertaining and I couldn't help but cheer him on when he\nsmashed sh!t. I think what made the Hulk work was because he was used\nsparingly.<br><br>Lo-Ki as the villain was great. I felt he was developed a lot better\nhere than in Thor. He was witty and had an evil aura about him\nespecially when he was interacting with the \"mortals\".<br><br>Never have I enjoyed a movie so much as the Avengers. The 2 hour plus\nruntime flew by easily and I was left wanting more once it ended. Once\nin a while a masterpiece of a film comes along, and after the hilarious\nclosing scene after the credits, it was clear that this was Marvel's\nMasterpiece.

{"review": "\nThe Avengers is simply a superb movie in every way that matters. Forget\ncomparing it to other films of the genre. I'll save that for a later\ndate because it really isn't important. Judging it as a stand alone\npiece of entertainment, it's the best time I've had in theaters in a\nvery long time. First off, forget what you think you know or expect\nbecause it operates at a higher level then anyone would have guessed.\nThere is very little clich\u00e9d about the film. They establish their own\nuniverse by themselves but it is so aided by all the previous solo lead\nin films. If you've seen them all, you're in for a real treat with\nAvengers. If you haven't, you'll enjoy them MORE now watching them\nafter Avengers. They fearlessly take the adventure wire to wire but\nmanage to make you really care about every circumstance, character and\nscene. Every character is believable given the nature of the universe\nthey establish. You really are drawn in to the world and to the each\nand every character right from the first act. That connection makes the\naction more meaningful, just like with the best of movies regardless of\ngenre. The dialog has been called superb by fans and critics alike for\na reason. The conflict and tension present between EVERYONE\n(protagonist, antagonist, friend, and foe) absolutely makes the film.\nThe performances that stem off of that are all remarkable. The charisma\nthis film packs, and there's plenty of it, comes from the flawless\nperformances and the dialog. Also, the supporting cast is utilized\nperfectly. This is as good and as fun of a film that has ever been\nmade. Bold statement, I know. I rarely rely on critics but when nine\nout of ten of them praise this film they are doing so for a reason. It\nmakes you wonder what those few others saw or how much they were paid\nnot to like an instant classic.\n"},
{"review": "\nOne thing that I do not understand is how people could hate on this\nwonderous mash-up in film history. First time it has ever been done on\na comic-book scale like this. The story has a working heart, tons of\naction and a sense of humor all around a basic-comic book story (which\nsome people tend to rebuke). However with the basic plot, it preserves\nthe film's sanity, for with a complex and darker plot, the film would\ncontain that of a messy fashion. Hands down, one of the greatest movies\nI have ever seen, being a DC fanatic and a comic-book reader, I\nacknowledge the greatness that sparks out of this film. Don't listen to\nwhat some mistaken others say, watch this amazing movie and watch it at\nthe proper guidelines expecting a simple, action-packed cinematic\nMARVEL. The main villain Loki provides some of the best villainy I've\nseen following Heath Ledger as Joker.\n"},

His fight scene with Hulk was crazy, so\ngood!!! Iron Man was awesome, he provided witty sarcasm that lightened\nthe mood, he had some incredible action scenes and the special effects\nof his costume attaching itself to him in mid air was incredible.<br><br>I didn't think after watching the film that the Hulk would be my\nfavorite character but he was, the film really changed when the Hulk\nwas unleashed, he was destructive and powerful and was a force to be\nreckoned with in the film. The fight scene between him and Loki was\nhilarious! (well if you call it fighting, it was more like hulk playing\nwith a toy) Black Widow was wicked, had some bad ass fighting moves\nwhich contributed to the film massively. And she was super hot!
