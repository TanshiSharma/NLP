{"review": "\nPerhaps the biggest dilemma you will have before going into this, is\nwhether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter. As\nsomeone who loved the series and was skeptical about Yates undertaking\nthis endeavor, I am pleased to say that I'm relieved, As Yates delivers\na refreshing and whimsical film. Sure, it doesn't have the characters\nwe've come to love, but with the creatures you encounter and with the\nadded humor of J.K Rowling, you will come to grip with the fact that\nthis movie will leave an impression.<br><br>Newt is a scientist who has an uncanny resemblance to Doctor Who, as\nhis strange and cunning outlook bares the trademarks of the epic\ncharacter. Newt is searching for unorthodox creatures. As he stuffs\nthem into his suitcase which is an accident waiting to happen. The\nsuitcase seems to be unhinged and dire need of a proper lock. As he\narrives in New York he mixes his bag with Jacob Kowalski, who lets\nloose beasts that start to run rampant in the streets. J.K. Rowling's\nfirst outing as a screenwriter is a wild success, with her keen eye for\ndetail and whimsical taste. \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\"\nbecomes a fine addition to her epic saga. I'm glad that there are four\nmore awaiting us because if Rowling proved anything, it's that she has\na lot more to offer.\n"},
{"review": "\nAmazing movie, they've done it again! The cast was amazing (though\nJohnny Depp as Grindewald takes time to get used to),visual effects\nstunning and the movie is everything you can except it to be. The movie\nhas so many great moments, it's happy and funny yet serious enough and\nhas AMAZING humour, I laughed a lot while watching it and so did\neveryone else :) LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS MOVIE and can't wait to see\nmore!!! I also love the fact that they didn't try to continue the\nPotter series but instead made a ''stand alone'' movie franchise which\nhas so many connections to the Harry Potter books/movies, it really\nmade me feel like they're not trying to ''milk us'' but just want to\nprovide us more amazing movies from the world we all love so much :)\n"},
{"review": "\nThe magical community in Britain has been fleshed out rather well\nthrough the seven Harry Potter books and the eight films that followed,\nbut America's magic users have been pretty much overlooked.<br><br>Until now.<br><br>The year is 1926.

{"review": "\nIt's a letdown. The fun and charming bits of Harry Potter were left out\nof this film. I like J.K. Rowling's work immensely, so that's hard to\nsay.<br><br>Plot-wise, things are a mess. Newt and his luggage full of magical\ncreatures are a side plot to the important things going on. The real\nstory is that an auror in New York is searching for a powerful and\ndangerous magical force that manifests within a teenager. His plan:\nturn the destructive energy the teenager carries into a weapon, I\nassume. Enter Newt Scamander, who is trying to transport a\nthunderbird(?) to Arizona for release back into the wild. Some of\nNewt's other creatures escape in New York, and he has to round them up,\nall while becoming entangled with the auror and his teenage target.<br><br>The plot sounds sort of okay, but it's not well integrated. The\ncharacters don't add up to much of anything, either. The sidekick baker\nis fairly likable, though, along with his brewing romance with Queenie.\nNewt's a bit thin as a character. Eddie Redmayne's dialog also tended\nto come out mumbled, which made him hard to understand at times. Throw\nin a few acronyms and oddball words like MACUSA, and that makes for\nmore confusion.<br><br>Altogether, the film needed more work to tighten the story lines and\nmake Fantastic Beasts a story focused on Newt and his menagerie,\ninstead of what we ended up with.\n"},

From now and then you get the, sometimes funny, sometimes\nsmart references to Harry Potter, but nevertheless is this a movie that\ncan totally stand on it's own.<br><br>There are some nitpicks, such as the very long introduction before we\nstart to see what the story is all about and the fact that there were a\nlot of lines referring to events that were setting up the second or the\nthird movie, but for a film that had to set up the rest of an upcoming\nfranchise it was totally acceptable and not a slight bit tedious.<br><br>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them stands perfect on its own and\ndoesn't need Harry Potter or any of the planned movies to get you\ninvested in its story and yet it is an obligation for every J.K.\nRowling wizarding world-fan to go see this movie.

This\nmovie is very entertaining and and heartwarming. It's no longer a dark\nsaga of an evil dark wizard trying to kill a young boy, it is an\ninsight into a magical world that is so grand and amazing! <br><br>Despite taking place way before our known HP time, there are enough\nquick and witty references to our known HP world throughout the movie\nto make Potterheads smile. I went in with less than no expectations,\nand I was pleasantly surprised. And LOVED IT. And the best part of it\nall- I've always somewhat disliked the HP movies, because I'm a\ndie-hard fan of the books. The movies never lived up to the books. For\nFantastic Beasts, there are no books to compare it to, so there's no\nroom to dislike! Can't wait for the next movies!\n"},

Honestly, you don't really\nlove or hate any character in the movie, even though, from the first\nminute, you really, REALLY want to like one of them. There was nothing\nthat felt really magical about this. It was just bland and boring. If\nyou are seeking another magical movie from the Harry Potter franchise,\nthis is not that.

Apart from that, she looks extremely plain\nand black hair makes her look hideous. -Unfortunately less Colin\nFarrell. - Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. Seriously? How bad was that?!\n-Very few magic spells are recited. That was very disappointing, as\nwe're watching the world of the wizards, aren't we? -There are many\nmovies which take place in the US, therefore, I think the Harry Potter\nuniverse should have stayed in England. I hope the sequels will be\nfilmed in Hogwarts and we will get to see more wizards, teachers and\nso. <br><br>Overall the movie is really refreshing, as it has an original\nscreenplay that isn't based on a novel, comic book, etc. The movie also\ngives a profound message about the desire to be accepted into society,\nespecially when one is different than the majority.\n"},

So no\nwonder that the full story of Newt Scamander has already existed in her\nmind, when she wrote his textbook for the Hogwarts' students and all\nthe rest of us.

One more\nspecial mention must go for Ezra Miller, who's so superb as Credence,\nthat he almost spoils the surprise at the end of the film. <br><br>Bottom line, not really a prequel, but a wonderful independent story\nthat happens to fit into the same universe where Harry Potter exists.\nDon't worry, there's room there for much more.\n"},

Whether or\nnot the expanding beauty of this visual universe will retain its magic\nor not remains to be scene as Avatar set a new standard of imagination.\nAnd whether or not due to budget or technological limitations, the\neffects were not quite as great as to be expected with all the new\nvisuals that Fantastic Beasts brought to the screen.<br><br>The target audience of the movie script might be aptly described as the\ncontinuing audience who grew up from the original Harry Potter movies\nwho were in elementary school and grew up through junior, middle school\nand high school. Fantastic Beasts includes the familiar ominous\ndarkness and stark loss, evil abuse, as well as happiness, joy, and a\npitch of accidental stupidity found in most of us.<br><br>Overall, Fantastic Beasts is fresh, new, dark, and enjoyable with some\nmeaningful messages endangered species, about child abuse, pain, and\ncompassion and tolerance, something that America needs more than ever\nnow.\n"},
{"review": "\nAs a die-hard fan of Harry Potter, I can't tell you how exited I was\nfor this movie to come out.

But Fantastic\nBeasts did the very opposite of disappoint. It was better than I could\nhave ever dreamed and it's a shame that we now have to wait two years\nfor the next one. Even if I wasn't a fan of Harry Potter I would still\nlove it (though a lot of it would go over my head) Every fan NEEDS to\nsee this movie asap.\n"},
{"review": "\nJust absolutely brilliant!! This new story first of all is funny. There\nis so much humour in this movie, a thing the potter movies always\nfailed to have, despite the books have lot of it. So in Fantastic\nBeasts you can really feel J.K.Rowlings style. And despite it being a\nprequel, it is incredibly creative, with so much imagination and good\nideas. The characters are just so funny and well thought through.It is\nin many ways a return to old times. To cast a spell you have to say it\nagain and the music is just a wonderful fantasy-soundtrack. Still in\nthe end you can feel the darkness to come... All in all just perfect\nfor anyone who likes fantasy and Harry Potter. And also just greatly\ndone in all technical ways.\n"},

{"review": "\nFantastic beasts and where to find them is a true Rowling story. It\nreminds you of the first two Harry Potter films ie it gives priority to\nthe story. For example, simple things like the wands in this movie made\nme beam with joy because they looked exactly as they were supposed to -\na normal piece of wood that holds immense power.<br><br>From the beginning of the film (when the newspaper montage is shown)\none can see Rowling's flair and style of writing. The film is a mixture\nof dark scenes and vibrant bright scenes which (like her books) has the\neffect of the ever lasting battle between good and evil. <br><br>The story covers it all - romance, mystery, plot twists and turns and a\nbrilliant climax. As always, JKR uses her eye for detail and leaves\nnothing to imagination. As the story begins, the audience starts having\nquestions and as the story progresses, all those questions are indeed\nanswered. <br><br>The only negative here perhaps is that if you haven't read the books\n(and especially if this is your first Harry Potter experience), you\nprobably won't appreciate it as much as a seasoned Potterhead would as\nthere are a lot of references (that arnt explained in detail - they\ndon't have to be if you have read the books) from the Harry Potter\nseries. For a seasoned Potterhead however, these references, some\nsubtle - like the Hallows' necklace; some not - like Leta Lestrange;\nmake the movie all the more enjoyable.<br><br>Finally, Jonny Depp is Gilderwald to the T. The few minutes he is on\nscreen makes your skin crawl in a magnificent way as you want to face\nhim but somehow do not. <br><br>Bottom line - I loved it. Can't wait for the next part.

{"review": "\n21 November 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight -\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. For those of you who are\nmissing the adventures of Harry Potter and his wizarding world,\nFantastic Beasts plugs that gap with alacrity. With a cast headed by\nthe supremely talented Eddie Redmayne, as Newt Scamander, this film\nimmerses us once more into a place where the world of wizard and No-Maj\n(American for Muggle) collide. We are again treated to an insight of\nthe machinations of J K Rowling's brain, and I for one am always happy\nthat she shares it with our world. You absolutely do not have to watch\nany of the Harry Potter films to understand any of the references to\nMuggles, Hogwarts and the like, this film is story on its own and we\nare introduced to a whole new collection of characters.......and\nmagical beasts, some of which are cute and some downright weird.\nExcellent visual effects, and a screenplay which includes more than a\nfew lighthearted moments. Another smash from the wizarding world and I\neagerly await the next instalment.\n"},
{"review": "\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them... It's not Harry Potter,\nhowever it is a classic in its own right. I loved the creature\ncreations for this movie including of course those greedy goblins which\nI was so very happy to see in this film as well. Eddie Redmayne did\nsuch a wonderful job as Newt Scamander and his cast of creatures was\nbreathtaking. They were all created differently and beautifully in\ntheir own right. His deep connection and understanding of the creatures\nwas so well done by Redmayne who seemed to be a little Autistic with\nhis lack of eye contact most of the time while talking, which if it was\ndone on purpose, I love it. It gives the character even more depth and\nbeauty. The other wizards were amazing, I think my favorite was Queenie\nGoldstein she was so endearing and such a wonderfully played character.\nShe had a lot of heart and that endeared her to the audience even more.\nIt was cool to see the differences between the American and British\nMinistries of Magic and the difference in terminologies between the two\ncountries. All in all this movie gets 5 enthusiastic stars from me. The\ncontinuity was incredible and I highly recommend it.\n"},
{"review": "\nAfter the Harry Potter Series, J.K Rowling has come up to bring all\nthose characters who were just mentioned in the HP Series. I went with\nmy friend on the 3rd Day from the release and experienced the movie in\n4DX. We both expected a lot more magic, the Hogwarts Castle and as in\nthe movie they mentioned about the Wizarding school in America, it was\npretty obvious that everyone wished a look at it. The title suggested\nthat the movie would be similar to the Deathly Hallows Parts of HP,\nwith a change, in place of Horcruxes we have Beasts. It also suggested\nthat Newt Scmandar is on his way to America to find some of the beast,\nbut instead he had them with himself. The movie shows that Newt is\nwriting the 1st Edition of his book, but in HP part 1, we can see Harry\nreading the 52nd Edition of the book. So, we can expect at least 5-6\nmore parts to be in the series. The overall movie experience was\namazing, especially the 4DX effects. Expected more from the movie, but\nits back in 1962, so that's OK for me.\n"},

{"review": "\nWhisper it quietly, but I might just have enjoyed this more than any of\nthe Harry Potter series. Not that any of them were bad. The first 2\nwere a bit ropy but still set out the world beautifully, our first view\nof Diagon Alley was a wonder to behold, and they generally improved\neach after the other, though 3 may still be the best. But maybe the\nfact that this could just be a movie without beholding to the books,\nwhich the original series had to, gave this much more freedom. It was\nalways impossible to completely be faithful to the complexity of the\nbooks story lines in the time restraints of a films runtime. Plus not\nknowing how it was going to turn out before even entering the cinema\nwas a bonus. I also appreciated the fact that the wizarding world could\nbe expanded beyond Hogwarts and its grounds, and the New York of 1920's\nwas beautifully realised and the ways in which the magical world of\nAmerica differed from that we had previously seen was cleverly done.\nThe film is also improved by the fact that from the start it has better\nacting talent in the main leads as with the best will in the world the\noriginal child cast, with exception of Emma Watson and Tom Felton, were\nlacking a touch, though they improved a bit as time went on. This does\nsuffer from the problems of the first couple of Potters in that it has\nto set up the world, and maybe tries to squeeze a bit too much in to\npave the way for the sequels, and also Newts story and the forewarning\nof Grindelwald seem a bit squashed unnaturally together.

{"review": "\nI went to see this film with ONE expectation: make me feel magical like\nHP films did. Bring the magic! Well, Fantastic Beasts delivered.<br><br>First of all, let me write down a few lines about Eddie Redmayne's\nperformance and about his Newt Scamander. Eddie was just amazing. He\nnailed the character. His expression, non-verbal language and kindness\nbought me over almost instantly. He is shy, closed person who\nabsolutely loves all sorts of fantastic animals and more importantly -\nunderstands them. It was a treat seeing him in every single frame he\nwas in. Bravo! <br><br>Moving on to Colin Farrell, aka Percival Graves. The moment you first\nmeet him you know this guy means business. He is focused and powerful.\nWhat I liked personally was that throughout the whole story you weren't\nreally sure whether Graves is bad or sort of good... I find this\nmorally gray personality compelling, especially in times where we live\nin Disney Star Wars and Disney Marvel, both featuring pretty damn bland\nprotagonists and antagonists. Breath of fresh air indeed. <br><br>No-Maj was outright fun and interactions between Newt and him simply\nput a big ol smile on my face. That is the kind of humour I do like and\nenjoy. Great fun!<br><br>Now the picture itself. Look, it's nothing ground-breaking, even a\nlittle predictable at times, but it's the execution that plays the main\nrole here. Special effects are sharp, clean and very subtle. Beasts are\ncolorful, properly magical and perfectly voiced. You will get lost in\nNewt's zoo, never wanting to go back to real life. Every character has\nits logical place and pacing makes sense. <br><br>I have yet to create a final opinion about Johnny Depp being casted as\nGellert Grindelwald, as I'm not fond of his acting skills. However,\nthis did not hurt my overall rating of Fantastic Beasts and Where to\nFind Them. <br><br>Go see it in IMAX, you will get magically rewarded.\n"},

Some, just enough, actually,\nof the familiar landmarks and touchstones are there - Hogwarts,\nDumbledore, muggles, etc. - but only as frame setting reference points.<br><br>The story is otherwise apart from the world that Rowling showed with\nHarry Potter and we're well rewarded by journeying to it.

{"review": "\nThis was a very great spin off of the Harry Potter books. After all,\nNewt Scamander did not appear in the Harry Potter books, but was\nmentioned in the books. Also we saw Gellert Grindelwald, who was of\ncourse the inspiration of Tom Riddle, also known as the evil Lord\nVoldemort. He was also once Albus Dumbledores friend until his rise in\ndark power and then was imprisoned after trying to possess the Elder\nWand and then was murder by Voldemort when he was looking for the wand.\nThis movie also tells more about Grindelwald's past. He uses this boy\nnamed Credence Barebone who was also an Obscurial a powerful dark force\nthat causes destruction and chaos. Its sister is called an Obscurus and\nthe Obscurial was its host and Scamander kept it alive in a magic\nshield even after the Obscurial was destroyed by the counsel of wizards\nin New York City. Grindelwald was also arrested and then taken to\nAzkaban. Scamander also came to New York with a suitcase full of\nmagical creatures that got loose and ran a muck around the city, but\nthey weren't dangerous. Just mischievous. Newton Scamander managed to\nget them all back though and safe in his suitcase and then went back to\nEngland and after saying goodbye to Porpentina who of course becomes\nhis wife in the future. Also Jacob Kowalski is also a likable character\nand opens up his own bakery after working in a can factory. Also he is\nthe first muddle to be in love with a magic person. Yep this movie is\nreally interesting and if you read the book that its based on, it will\ntell you all about the creatures in the Harry Potter universe.\n"},

The jokes were funny, we laughed, and we also were carried away\nby the thrilling adventure. Although I felt that there were some parts\nthat were a bit too stretched out (cannot complain though as i enjoyed\nevery minute in the wizarding world). Newt Scamander was acted\nsplendidly by Eddie Redmayne. The gentle, animal lover/geek with\nawkward personality towards human was really shown. Some might say that\nthe CGI was a little bit too much, but how else can you include dozen\nof mythical creatures in a movie? The only downside I saw was that the\nAmerican wizarding school, Ilvermony, didn't get as much part as I\nthought it would get. After the ilvermony sorting feature and the\nilvermony's backstory on pottermore, I thought this movie was going to\ninclude some parts about the school, but apparently it wasn't. It is\nindeed not a mind blowing movie, but it gave such nice aftertaste. It\nis the kind of movie that makes you smile while and after watching it.\nOh the nostalgic feeling you will get after seeing the wizarding world\nagain!<br><br>All in all, a new wizarding story awaits!

And this movie is sadly nothing like the\noriginal HP movies. The only thing that is has in common are the\nspecial effects (for the apparitions). There was no real dialogue\nbetween the characters. Just silly one-liners and the occasional\nhumorous remark. I am also very angered by the fact that they just\nintroduced a new concept (obscurials) to the HP franchise that would\nliterally change everything (if obscurials exist why hasn't Harry\nPotter become one?

The HP\nfranchise is the most British thing since James Bond and Doctor Who. I\nnever really realized it before but now that I watched this movie it\nbecame very clear to me.

We watch as the\nprotagonist hunts down a half dozen or so \"fantastic beasts\", mostly\none at a time and in extended chase sequences. If you do not enjoy\nvisiting zoos or watching car chases (which have the same dynamic as\nanimal chases, no matter how exotic the species), you may be bored. I\ncertainly was.<br><br>The second half of the movie is more engaging, as loose strands from\nthe first are finally woven into a conventional good vs. evil morality\nplay. But even here, virtually every turn in the plot is easily\npredictable, as Rowling uses the same pro- Muggle/anti-Muggle dynamic\nemployed in the Potter series to define her characters, plus an\nironically preachy lesson in the harmful nature of organised religion.\nFortunately, the actors, particularly the good guys and gals, are able\nto overcome the limitations of the script so that I couldn't help but\nlike them and cheer them on. The cinematic recreation of early 20th\ncentury New York is also well done.<br><br>However, on the whole, I think Rowling is capable of better work than\nthis.

{"review": "\nWalking into this movie I really had no expectations, It wasn't that I\nthought It was going to be particularly bad or anything, I just wasn't\nhyped. How wrong was I ... After one viewing Fantastic Beasts and Where\nto Find Them has become my favorite film of 2016 as of this moment, and\nfor good reason. The characters were so likable after five minutes of\nscreen time or less, the acting was on point with particular favor\ngoing to Ezra Miller who gives another knock out performance after We\nNeed to Talk About Kevin and the special effects are just straight out\nof this world. Each and everyone of the creatures look beautiful with\nmy favorites being the Occamy, the Thunderbird and of course the\nadorable Niffler. Eddie Redmayne plays the roll of Newt Scamander\nperfectly, Kowalski is both incredibly likable and greatly hilarious\nand most surprisingly of all Colin Farrell is great as Percival Graves\nuntil he becomes Johnny Depp's Gellert Grindlewald. And what more can I\nsay, J.K Rowling's still got it, as has David Yates and I just couldn't\nfind a thing wrong with this movie. Top marks.\n"},
{"review": "\nAs a self-proclaimed Potter-head I admit I was excited, but also a bit\nworried when I entered the theater. How could anyone create a wonderful\nworld of witchcraft, without Harry?!

I was smitten almost immediately as the adorably unassuming\nNewt Scamander's thieving beast escaped, and from then on, the film had\nme. <br><br>Before I went to the theater, I hadn't read the book or even seen more\nthan half of a trailer. I honestly had no idea of what the story was\nabout, except that it had something to do with some pretty Fantastic\nBeasts. I had no idea of the heart-warming, action and suspense packed,\nincredibly filmed, tale of fantasy that awaited me.<br><br>First, I want to talk about the story. Without the adventure that\nRowling created, the film would have been beautiful but boring. The\nstory perfectly weaves magic from Potter world we know, with the old-\ntime-y feel of 1926, while also incorporating more than enough action\nand suspense to keep us on the edge of our seats, while the\nheartwarming story of a young man and his beasts. As JK Rowling's\npremier screenplay, she did fantastically- as the name implies. <br><br>The wonder of the film doesn't end at the plot. The cinematography was\nbeautifully curated to present us an entirely new era of the wizarding\nworld. The special effects gave us some of the most fantastic creatures\nthat our minds could comprehend, while also feeling so real that the\nviewers couldn't be anything but fully engaged. The actors were also\nperfectly chosen for their roles, and fully embodied the characters\nthey transformed into. <br><br>Overall, I was impressed. The seemed to be almost fully indented of\nHarry Potter, only sharing their world. This separation I think was\nextremely important because it leaves Fantastic Beasts room to grow and\nbecome its own series for this next generation. I can't wait to see\nwhat comes next!\n"},

He was always very\nfunny and usually quite sarcastic. Eddie Redmayne was great as Newt\nScamander, the future author of the Hogwarts textbook fantastic beasts\nand where to find them. Who, accidentally lets some of his beasts loose\nin New York, and has to track them down and put them back in his\nsuitcase. Seems simple, right? Only no, it's a lot harder than Newt and\nthe gang think, because because of things like zoo chases and having to\njourney throughout New York to do so, and a dark energy force called an\nobscurus, which can cause pure destruction and destroy anything that is\nin its path.

There were some comments about it leaning heavily on\nthe Potter franchise which don't appear to be true. It does follow the\nHP universe with an American twist. I particularly liked the actor who\nplayed the lead, Newt Salamander. He reminded me of Matt Smith who I've\nbeen missing ever since he left Doctor Who (Capaldi just doesn't cut\nit, sorry). I also found the subplot with the baker/cannery worker\ncharming. It was just what the movie needed - a bit of muggle :^). In\ngeneral the actors did a very good job.

{"review": "\nThe best thing about the movie is the creatures, and the world of these\nfantastic creatures. The photography was excellent in capturing the\nmagic and awe of the world of magic. This is backed up by Eddie\nRedmayne's brilliant performance as the awkward but kind Newt\nScamander. Co-starring alongside Redmayne is Dan Fogler, who seems more\nlike a Kevin James lookalike. He is both charming, and funny. Another\nstrong point is the cameos by Johnny Depp, and an unrecognizable Ron\nPerlman as Gnarlak. The bad part of the movie was the story-telling. It\nseems like two different stories set in the same world. The tones are\ncompletely different. One story focuses on Newt and his creatures,\nwhich is more like a children's adventure story. The other story,\ncentering more on Farrell's character is darker and follow's the tone\nof the Carrie remake. When the two stories merged, it seemed forced. I\nguess Yates is brilliant in focusing on one story, like he did in the\nHarry Potter movies than he is at telling intricate plots. The pacing\nwas a problem too, as it seemed to proceed too slowly, especially the\none focusing on Ezra Miller's character. Miller's character is wasted,\nand despite having little screen time, you can't feel a sense of\ntragedy for his character at the end. John Voight was unnecessary, and\nprovided no new stakes to the story. However, Harry Potter fans will\nprobably enjoy this movie because is opens a new world to the Harry\nPotter universe. For non-Harry Potter fans like myself, I am just\nmildly entertained. Let's see if the sequel is better.\n"},
{"review": "\nLet me say up front that this is not a bad movie. But I notice a lot of\nPotter-fans are looking at this movie through rose-colored glasses, and\nare unable to see its obvious flaws. This is a pretty flawed movie.\nFun, but not great.<br><br>But lets start with the good. The characters are fun, the visuals are\nstunning and impressive. And the amazing Potter atmosphere of whimsy is\nall over this film. I also liked how the music of the movie starts with\nthe soft Potter-theme, and then immediately abandons it for the rest of\nthe film, and sticks with its own new theme music. There's plenty of\nreferences for fans to enjoy, but you do not need to be a Potter fan to\nunderstand what is going on in the film. This movie can very much stand\non its own.<br><br>But now the bad. The movie seems to forget that it has a plot for about\nhalf of its running time. For most of the movie we follow the main\ncharacter in his quest to retrieve his missing animals all over New\nYork, which is fun, but has very little to do with the main plot. It\nseems as if the movie suddenly remembers that it has a villain (who is\nbriefly mentioned with quick flashes of newspapers during the opening)\nand it forgets that it still has to build towards a finale. Out of\nnowhere the final act is suddenly dropped into the movie. That is a bit\nsloppy, and it leaves the main villain very undeveloped. I also think\nmany of the characters are a bit shallow, and steeped in stereotypes\nand clich\u00e9s.<br><br>Technically, the movie feels a bit sloppily edited at times, which\nmakes some scenes hard to follow. And especially during the final act\nthere are a lot of bright flashing lights that are a pain on the eyes\nif you are sitting in a dark theater.<br><br>That said, I was still entertained.

We spend an inordinate amount of time following our main\ncharacters chasing CGI creatures around and looking more like a Pokemon\ngame than actually delivering anything that's terribly interesting as\nfar as story development goes. The film looks great and the\nperformances are solid but it is so lacking in the aforementioned that\nI found it increasingly tedious as the film dragged on. If you're\ndazzled by movies heavy on creatures and effects and don't care if its\na bit light on story, you'll probably love this. But if you're looking\nfor something that's going to deliver a compelling story that decides\nto get interesting some time before three-quarters of the way through\nthe movie's two-hour running time, then you'll really need to look\nelsewhere. I give this five out of ten not because it's utterly\nterrible, it isn't, but it's just not interesting enough and I don't\nthink it warrants the high scores people are giving it. There are far\nbetter films that rate that high.\n"},
{"review": "\nI kept waiting to engage with either the characters or with one of the\nbeasts. Such an engagement was not forthcoming. I like Eddie Redmayne,\nso it is nothing to do with him. So much emphasis on creating this\nalternate world that the basics of filmmaking appear to have been\nsacrificed. Never does anyone look into you, the screen, and speak.\nThere is never any eye contact. You do not feel attached to Eddie's\ncharacter. Even my children were squirming in the seats and looking\naround bored. They wanted food and said they were hungry. The movie\ntherefore appears to fail both children and adults like me. My 12yo son\nwho is a mega Harry Potter fan could not engage with the movie. \"I like\nreading J K Rowling's books but I am not sure about this one\" is what\nhe said. What he means is that, after having watched the movie, it has\nput him off the book as well. <br><br>I got up to get food for the kids, they followed me and were more keen\non ice creams and sweets rather than getting back to the screen to what\nhappened next. So much for fantastic pointless beasts. If you liked\nHarry Potter then that is not a guarantee that you will like this one.\nThat is for sure. If you liked The Lord of Rings and sat through the\ntrilogy, then you may have what it takes to sit through this one.\nPerhaps looking at this as a movie nothing to do with Harry Potter\nmight help. If your children do not get attached to the movie then\ndon't be surprised.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", starring Eddie\nRedmayne-Jupiter Ascending, My Week With Marilyn; Dan Fogler-The\nGoldbergs_tv, Balls of Fury; Katherine Waterston-Steve Jobs, Taking\nWoodstock and Colin Farrell-Saving Mr. Banks-Crazy Heart.<br><br>This is the beginning of a 5 picture franchise that is a spin off of\nthe Harry Potter series-not a sequel or a prequel, but a spin off. It's\nwritten by J.K. Rowling and it is in the same Potterverse but it takes\nplace about 70 years earlier, in 1926. Eddie plays Newt Scamander, a\nperson of magic that is traveling to New York from Britain while\nresearching his book about magical creatures-FYI: His book is\nreferenced in the Harry Potter movies as being studied by students at\nHogwarts. Eddie is carrying a suitcase with some of these magical\ncreatures inside it but some get loose and draw the attention of the\nU.S. magical counsel. Katherine is sort of a rule enforcer for the\ncounsel that tries to keep the magical world and the human world\nseparate. Don't want the frail humans to panic, of course, so if a\nhuman sees something that they shouldn't, they are magically made to\nforget whatever they have seen. Oh yeah, in the Potter movies, humans\nwere called Muggles. Here, they use the term No-Mags, which is short\nfor No-Magic, referring to humans that don't have magical abilities.\nDan is a No-Mag that becomes friends with Eddie. Colin is a person of\nmagic that is on the counsel. The effects are fantastic and so are the\ncreatures and there is a big name star that makes a cameo near the end\nof the movie, as the villain. I was a fan of the Harry Potter movies so\nit is good to get into a version of them that has adults in it, instead\nof kids. It's rated \"PG- 13\" for fantasy action and violence and has a\nrunning time of 2 hours &amp; 13 minutes. If you liked the Harry Potter\nmovies, you should enjoy this one-and the 4 more in the works. I liked\nit and would buy it on Blu-Ray.\n"},
{"review": "\nWizard comes into muggle world and loses some of his magical and\nincredible animals which cause some problems. Start of the movie had a\ngreat deal of information on dark wizard Gellert that from the\nbeginning you are in expectation of him and it kind of triggers later\non. So now Newt is trying to figure out where are his beasts while\nbeing constantly followed by Tina and her paranoia about everything and\nJacob, a muggle that wants to open a bakery but accidentally found\nabout beasts. As movie goes it gets darker and a lot of characters get\nin the way and most interesting is Percival (Colin) that is a dark and\npowerful character which helped a lot to get a notion that he might be\nimportant. Last 20 minutes of the movie were absolutely amazing as Depp\ngot his on screen time and it was great to see him. Movie is sometimes\nvery slow paced and doesn't get an idea where it is going but then it\nsomehow gets there. Eddie as Newt is absolutely incredible as he proves\nhe is magnificent actor that deserves everything and in movie his love\ntowards beasts and kindness are huge. Colin as Percival is also\nbrilliant with not so much time on screen but when he gets there he\njust shines even brighter then everybody else. Most interesting movie\ncharacter is Jacob played by Fogler, it is entertaining, funny and\nbrings brightness to everything. Katherine's character Tina is very\nhard and sometimes it is incredible but sometimes feels like boring and\nyou just wish she wants there at all. Beasts are magnifying.\nEntertaining movie with some great and extremely funny situations but\nsometimes pacing isn't correct and flow of the movie seems sometimes\nmessed. 8.4/10\n"},

{"review": "\nI went to this movie as, while I'm not a HP nerd, I did enjoy the first\nfew films and I like the story theme of looking after/capturing fantasy\ncreatures. However, I left the film disappointed.<br><br>The characters to me, especially Newt and Tina, who were both playing\nthe \"Shy awkward\" type and lacked any chemistry or audience appeal.\nThey were too inward, speaking to themselves rather than other\ncharacters, but at the same time they didn't have any mystery or\nintrigue.<br><br>The setting is also very mundane, the 1920s wasn't the most vibrant\ntime but even the magical realm was very plain with bad cgi.<br><br>Which leads me on to the monsters. I wish they'd gone with at least\nsome physical puppets. As a main part of the plot, the weightless\nsub-par rendering really let me down. Major suspects were the goblin\nclub dancer ( which gave me an Oblivion character vibe), the demiguise\nwith bad texturing and hair-physics and the Thunderbird, who looked\nhollow. <br><br>I will say the Obscurus did look interesting though, it was well\ndesigned as a faceless angry mass.<br><br>The crazy anti-magic cult felt like they were from another movie, and\nwithout the HP element, you could easily make a Carrie-esque horror.<br><br>The pacing is also slow at the beginning, you could easily walk in on\nthe animal-care scene and not miss much. <br><br>Overall, just a very mundane movie which is a pity for the HP franchise\nand fantasy films in general.\n"},

{"review": "\nI wasn't sure what to expect from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find\nThem. It smelt curiously of \"cash grab\" since the Harry Potter films\nmanaged to conclude themselves quite perfectly, all the more so\nconsidering Warner Brothers preemptively announced four sequels before\nthis film had reached theatres. The best compliment I can give it is\nthat it proved me wrong- Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them never\nfeels lazy, or cheap - it's a worthy adventure that will have all but\nthe most cynical revelling in the wonder of the Wizarding World. <br><br>The film is fast paced and constantly dishing out new surprises, in the\nform of beautifully rendered, inventive CGI \"beasts,\" and a number of\nhilarious, imaginative features of this magical world of New York that\nsuccessfully create the illusion of being in a different world. There\nare tons of minute little details that delight in the purest sense. The\nset of new faces are mostly agreeable, the most likable being Dan\nFogler, whose bumbling \"non - magi\" is a welcome addition. He elevates\nsometimes silly jokes with expert comedic timing and facial\nexpressions. Katherine Waterston is fine enough, as is her flirtatious\nsister. And what of star Eddie Redmayne? He is alternately charming and\nannoying. The character of Newt Scamander is one fully realised by\nRowling's script, yet Redmayne's Hugh Grant- esque, crouched delivery\nis at times grating. Nonetheless he wins you over in the end. I won't\nsay who the villains are, because that plays into the intrigue of the\nplot, but suffice to say villainous characters were decidedly underused\nfor my taste, and could've used far more development than the already\npacked script granted them. <br><br>In all, this film never quite touches the awe and great characters\nimbued within each Harry Potter film and book, but it offers many\ndelights nonetheless, and is definitely worth seeing, especially on a\nbig screen, where it looks positively beautiful.\n"},
