{"review": "\nIGNORE THE TRAILER: GO SEE IT!<br><br>I saw this movie tonight with a friend and it was spectacular. Going\nin, I was excited as a life-long Disney fan but also expecting a\nsomewhat cheesy good-vs-evil type of movie based on what I had seen in\nthe trailer. I couldn't have been more wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers\nan amazing performance and makes a well-known, previously rather one-\ndimensional Disney villain relate-able and more sympathetic, while also\nmanaging to look like a convincing, gorgeous, magical creature.<br><br>The CGI is a tad heavy and a little freaky at times (such as the three\ncoloured pixies/Aunts) but was used, in combination with some amazing\nsets, to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent\nof the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as \"Hellboy 2\" and\n\"Pan's Labyrinth\". The effort by the art team here really helps to draw\nyou into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you\nwish you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your\nimagination.<br><br>Although Maleficent's character has been humanised in this re-telling,\nthe story really emphasises that she isn't human at all, and explores\nthe ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she\nencounters.<br><br>The plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring\nthe anti-hero (Breaking Bad, Hannibal...) and shows that Disney is\ntrying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and\nwhite, good or evil, etc.<br><br>I feel like I am gushing over this film, but as a Disney classic lover\nI have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with\nkids and adults equally. I do expect some controversy over parts of the\nfilm but I won't discuss those here.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film is a TRUE fairy tale. It's dark. It's raw. And it's written\nfrom the dark, raw experience of women. <br><br>Maleficent is about what happens when your Prince turns into a Frog.\nIt's the personal, inner journey to recover from a physical trauma and\nemotional betrayal by those who are closest to us and who we trust the\nmost. It's about how to survive that type of horrific evil without\nbecoming evil yourself. It's message is that profound.<br><br>The critics complaining about this film want \"fairy tales\" to stay in\nthe same \"one-love-fits-all\" mode where people are either good or evil\nand that all one needs is to find \"romantic\" love and marry a \"good\"\nPrince or Princess, and you will live \"happily ever after,\" safe from\nany pain or sorrow. But real life is a lot messier than that.<br><br>It's actually evidence of how rare it is to see women's unfiltered\nsubjective emotional landscape portrayed on film that it seems many of\nthe critics cannot even wrap their brains around it! <br><br>No matter. This film is so sensually visually stunning and viscerally\nemotionally cathartic that sheer word of mouth enthusiasm is going to\nmake this a blockbuster, no matter what the critics say.<br><br>And it's equally rare to see a protagonist whose inner landscape is\nmore complex than simply extracting revenge, destroying their enemies\nand...roll credits. People are more complicated than THAT fairy tale we\nare sold in every other \"action\" and \"adventure\" film that only serves\nto reinforce the psychopathic values of revenge and bravado.<br><br>Sometimes a film is so ahead of its time that the critics are behind\nand so philosophically deep that it's message is incomprehensible to\nthe more superficial among us. This is one such film.<br><br>Woolverton and Jolie have crafted a masterpiece.<br><br>Don't miss it.\n"},
{"review": "\nEvery true fan of the original Sleeping Beauty (1959) was skeptical\nabout this and how much it had to deviate from the actual movie, and as\nmore of the movie was revealed, it was only proving to be another\nfemale empowerment, victimized villain kind of a movie. But I'm glad I\nwas wrong, for I'm sure only by watching the whole movie can we truly\nappreciate and understand the very convincing back story and\ndevelopment the character was subject to. Of course with very liberal\nchanges to the original plot, the key elements that you'd look for are\nintact. Need I mention the perfect casting of Angelina Jolie,\nMaleficent truly comes to life in full form by Angelina's stunning\nskills and presence. A twist that's not clich\u00e9, sentiments that are\ndeep, humor that's ever so natural and action that always keeps you at\nthe edge of your seat! Maleficent in this movie is not exactly as we\nknow of her from the few minutes we got to see her in the original\nmovie, but let me tell you she's every bit deliciously evil. It was\namusing to see Angelina play a role that requires a lot of nuances to\npull of this character with a lot of depth as opposed to the\none-dimensional character from the movie. Never letting off the grip,\nshe carried the movie on her shoulders. Nothing to take away from the\nbeauty of the rest of the movie which takes breath with excellent\ndirection and visual effects that will truly transport you to another\nworld, and the amazing work by all the 'supporting' actors. Yes, the\nother characters weren't as fleshed out as Maleficent, but I see that\nas good thing, given the title and theme. A spectacular balance. I'd\nalso like to bring light on the enchanting score, thanks to James\nNewton Howard, this maestro is underrated.<br><br>A comprehensive movie, there's a little something for audiences of all\nages, truly a masterpiece.\n"},
{"review": "\nMaleficent is magnificent. The story is sophisticated enough to delight\nadult audiences with a brilliant take on the beloved tale with a\ndelightful twist including the meaning of true love. The characters are\nsympathetic and there is enough excitement.<br><br>The art direction and cinematography are beautiful. The fairy land\nscenes resemble a pre Raphaelite painting. The castle was a bit generic\nCGI. The right blend of human faces with CGI so it didn't look too\nanimated. The director Stromberg who did Oz the Great and Powerful did\nan even better job here.<br><br>Angelina Jolie's expressive face is the perfect showcase for the\ncharacter - it is the role of her lifetime. Like the way they did her\ncheekbones to make it like the Disney cartoon. Sam Riley as her\nsidekick morphs into many fairy tale creatures crow, dragon horse. The\ncreatures are well done not awkward in movement and not overwhelming.\nElle Fanning is sweet and picture perfect for the role of Aurora and\nBrenton Thwaites plays her prince. The fairies including Juno Temple\nand Imelda Staunton are cute too.<br><br>Liked this more than the Snow White movies 'Mirror Mirror' and 'Snow\nWhite and the Hunstman'. The first was fun but a bit silly and the\nsecond was too grim. Maleficent is the perfect blend of excitement and\nfairy tale. Most enjoyable film of the year.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have waited a long time for this film and it did not disappoint!<br><br>The film is very entertaining with stunning visuals and impressive\naction scenes. This is definitely Angelina's film and she is incredible\nas Maleficent.<br><br>Supporting cast are also impressive and Elle was perfect casting for\nAurora. The 3d was also good and really did enhance many scenes. The\nscore by James Newton Howard really blew me away and adds magic to the\nfilm.<br><br>My screening was all made up of adults which surprised me. The trailers\nfor the film really give the film a dark tone, however the actual film\nhas many light Disney moments. <br><br>I highly recommend this film and the 3d is worth paying a bit extra!\n"},
{"review": "\nLet me start by saying that Maleficent has been a personal favorite of\nmine when it comes to Disney villains. Throughout her many\ninterpretations, she has simply been Evil (yes, with a capital E). So\nforgive me if this review is a bit of a rant.<br><br>In this adaptation, she is reinterpreted as a good fairy (because she's\napparently not a human sorceress anymore?) that simply has a hissyfit.\nShe is certainly not evil - just angry for a little while. She even\nends up becoming a Godmother??<br><br>Even King Stephen's character is butchered. Why does he go insane over\nher? If he were really the bad guy, why wouldn't he have killed\nMaleficent when he had the chance? What possible reason does he have\nfor being indifferent about the welfare of his daughter?<br><br>Speaking of Aurora, it's worth mentioning that she is relatively\nalright, but still not too close to her original character. A petty\naesthetic thing about her is that her hair and eyebrows are not the\nsame color, which is really distracting. <br><br>Additionally, they rehash the concept from Frozen, which is that 'True\nLove' doesn't have to be from some man. If this trend continues from\nDisney, all we'll see is sisterly/Godmotherly/family love movies where\nRomance is thrown out the window because it apparently doesn't end with\na \"happily ever after\" anymore.<br><br>Overall, this film was simply horrible if you respected Maleficent as a\nvillain. If you did like Maleficent as she was, I don't recommend\nseeing this movie. Even if you like the idea of there being no such\nthing as Evil, I urge you not to see this movie. Don't support the\npeople who made it.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you like fairy tales and believe in love then you'll hate this film.\nIt's beautifully filmed and well acted by Angelina Jolie, but the story\nis so over the top with the male hatred it becomes ludicrous.<br><br>By the end of the film I just started laughing at how insane it was.\nMade me think the writer just had to be a woman and she must have\nsuffered the worst break up in history, or else she just really hated\nmen.<br><br>I was looking forward to seeing this film ever since it was teased in\ntheaters. Now I wish I had my money back.<br><br>Some may say this film is like Frozen. That's only if we discovered\nChristoff was actually in league with the evil Prince and Olaf was\ntheir spy.\n"},
{"review": "\nWent to the theater, expecting to experience the dark side of Angelina\nJolie who plays a vengeful fairy with lofty wings and left the theater\nfeeling astonished by how beautifully the movie has changed my\nperspective towards the antagonist.<br><br>The remake of the classic Disney movie, \"Sleeping Beauty\" timely and\nsoundly pans out by wonderfully depicting both beautiful and gloomy\nsides of fairy land of Maleficent that feud with selfish humans. The\nVisual effects and acting are so magnificent that mysterious creatures\nand the cast look totally in sync. The plot naturally goes along with\ncoherent and succinct narrations that add an in-depth storytelling. Not\nto mention a good composition that captures significant moments without\nboredom. <br><br>There are a lot more to feel, enjoy, and learn from what I would call,\n\"One of the most underrated movies of the year\" based on how the score\nis given. Not a Disney movie fan? Doesn't like a female protagonist? I\ndon't think it will matter because once you start watching, you will be\nmesmerized by the imposing world and the ambivalent emotion of\nMaleficent.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie is not worth, keep your kids from seeing this movie unless\nyour want them to be disappointed and very confuse.

{"review": "\nI had my doubts before, but now I am sure if it.<br><br>Disney has sold out. <br><br>Recently Disney has been releasing films that, whether the public\nchooses to acknowledge it or not, have been paint-by-numbers at best.\nFilms like The Lone Ranger, Thor The Dark World, and Frozen. Yes,\nFrozen. It's the same Disney crap you've seen over and over, people.\nDon't get me wrong, I LOVE Disney. But not THIS Disney... one that\nwould butcher one of its own beloved fairy tales to make a quick buck.\nYes, you heard right. Disney did stoop that low. I should have known\nthat this film would be garbage from the get-go when they hired Alice\nin Wonderland writer Melissa Woolverton to pen the screenplay and Alice\nin Wonderland production designer Robert Stromberg to direct (Are you\nsensing a pattern here?) Let's touch on that for a moment-- The Mouse\nHouse, in its infinite wisdom, got a PRODUCTION DESIGNER/VFX SUPERVISOR\nWHO HAD NEVER DIRECTED ANYTHING TO DIRECT THEIR $200 MILLION\nBLOCKBUSTER. As a result, Maleficent's beautiful visuals carry no\nweight, and the actors for the most part seem utterly lost. Because\nwhat the hell would a set designer know about directing actors? Even\nAngelina Jolie can't pull off her real emotional scenes because she is\nleft to direct herself. What really sank this movie for me was Disney\nblatantly ripping themselves off and using the \"true love\" twist from\nFrozen. Literally THE EXACT SAME TWIST. I have no problem with Disney\ncreating a strong independent heroine... but if you're going to do\nthat, Don't have your heroine wear a skintight leather black cat suit\nin the climax of your movie! In short, Disney has definitely lost its\nmagic, and it's going to be tough to get it back. Don't listen to the\npositive reviews. Remember how glowing Alice in Wonderland's were when\nit first came out? You have been warned.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is a complete joke, the only thing going for it is the\nvisual effects, In the 1959 Disney classic Maleficent is the mistress\nof evil and she was perfect in that role but in this nonsense movie she\nis a good person? her name does not seem good at all!<br><br>Also I want to write in some details why I did not like this movie and\nwhy the story was very weak in my opinion. First why is King Stefan\nevil? why did he send Aurora to live with the three fairies until she\nis 16? is he crazy? the curse stated that she will go into a sleep like\ndeath when she is 16 so why the hell will he send his daughter away all\nthose years and never even visit her? he could have made her live with\nthem until she is 16 and protected her in the castle or told the\nfairies to come and protect her on that day.<br><br>and coming to the fairies they portray them as idiots! the good fairies\nare idiots? and Prince Philip is not the true love of Aurora? what\nnonsense! finally the motherly kiss of Maleficent lifts the curse? she\nput it on in the first place!<br><br>and finally Maleficent kills Stefan (Aurora's father) and Aurora is\nhappy about that? what the hell?<br><br>Really a silly movie, I gave it 2/10 just because of the CGI which\nHollywood seem to think that this will save all movies not good writing\nand casting!\n"},
{"review": "\nI am very mixed about this film. Firstly, as many critics have singled\nout, I must praise Angelica's acting, mainly as the first good, then\nevil Maleficent. Now, while I could feel a little sorry for her being\nunable to bring this curse off Aurora, having to see, one of my best\nvillains, Maleficent turn back into good is just unnatural. It ends up\nlooking like a beloved Disney film that has been changed for the sake\nof young girls, who is only a little part of the audience, avoiding\nsimple but effective scares and risks, basically throwing out what many\nDisney fans remember about Sleeping Beauty. Parts of the film echoes\nparts of Wicked and Frozen. Of course, most people don't rush into\nromantic relationships but seeing Disney seemingly apologise for making\ntraditional relationships in past films happen, even though this is\nwhat happened in the era the film is set, is just horrid. I mean no\noffence to Frozen at all, since it is one of my most favourite Disney\nfilms of all time. But stealing the concept of real \"true love\" from\nFrozen is pathetic. If it wasn't for Disney with its stupid audience\nresearch, it could have easily looked even further into the darkness of\nMaleficent, which is almost no such thing in this film.\n"},
{"review": "\nReview: I really thought that this was going to be a typical Disney\nmovie about fairies and magic dust, but I really enjoyed it. Although\nthe storyline is based around Sleeping Beauty, I found it quite dark\nwith some adult content. The CGI throughout the movie looked impressive\nand Angelina Jolie played her part extremely well. After being betrayed\nby her loved one, she turns quite evil and full of hate, but once\nAurora comes into the picture, you get to see an inner sweetness which\nmade her character entertaining and a joy to watch.

A Great Watch!<br><br>Round-Up: Angelina Jolie really doesn't make that many movies anymore,\nbut when she comes out of the woodwork, she really does come out with\nsome good movies. From Changeling to the action packed Wanted, she\nreally does have a versatile acting ethic and with all of her\ncharitable work and her hectic family life, I'm not surprised that\nmaking movies is low down on her priority list. I liked the chemistry\nbetween her character and Sam Riley, who played the crow, and the\naction scenes were very well thought out by the director. Personally, I\ndon't think that it's a movie for the young ones because there are some\nscenes that will give them nightmares, but there are some scenes they\nwill enjoy, like her magical land and the amazing creatures.

{"review": "\nMaleficent is Disney successfully cashing in on popular characters it\nhas the rights to along with Angelina Jolie's star power (she plays the\ntile character).

However, the writing is\nincredibly lazy, and the plot has no consistency or logic.

{"review": "\nPros: The change of Story -<br><br>This film is great as it approaches the take on Maleficent in a more\nrealistic way compared to the Disney Animation movie Sleeping Beauty.\nIt was interesting to show Maleficent as the hero in the end and that\nshe delivered true love's kiss to Anora and not the prince.It would\nhave been stupid to show the prince kiss her and let that be true love,\nbecause its unrealistic as he didn't know her and therefore is not true\nlove. The story showed what true love is - Maleficent cared about Anora\nand understood her. So, that was interesting and well done. <br><br>Cons: <br><br>1. Well the story did good on the change but it felt fast paced and\nunstructured, and more could have been shown in there. <br><br>2. The world felt small and restricted the people involved. For\ninstance, the prince came from another kingdom which was never shown. <br><br>3. The action scenes were boring, especially the last scene with the\ndragon. In the Disney Animation the dragon scene was made to feel epic\nand huge but here it felt small and really rushed. There was no\nsuspense in the scene.<br><br>Overall:<br><br>I liked it! It was Great, could have been better though.\n"},
{"review": "\nInteresting and a fantastic film, because different visual effects. It\nshows different tales and the wicked witch by shows. In fact,there is\nno villains in the movie.Have the results of past mistakes. Angelina\nwas different from the classic film. I think it was really good movie.\nThe end of the film was different and creative. It was a film that\nexcites me. Maleficent's wings are very realistic. Horns made her\ndifferent, but the film should slightly improve.Angelina Jolie's acting\nis very good. Costumes were very successful. It worked carefully on\nthis issue. A family film that should be followed. I would definitely\nrecommend this film.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst; I would like to complement the photography and CGI effects.\nSimply stunning - even if I only saw it in flat format. I am sure 3D\nwas magical. Second; Angelina is superb as the betrayed angst ridden\nrevengeful elf-witch which redeems herself. Her body and face are\n'naturally' made up to be other-worldly looking. Bravo. The\nsuperlatives earn the 'deux points'. It is all downhill from here.\nAurora is portrayed as a plain village idiot with an age of 6 though\napproaching her 16th birthday. She is soppy as cold soup and zaps away\nany magic from the movie . I understand nobody wanted to play second\nfiddle to Angelina - but there seems to have been a stampede. The king\nis just plain incompetent at being a father, king, warrior, and at\ndestroying spindles and wings. He is incompetent at being evil - just\ncontemptibly irritating. His choice of baby sitters proves the point.\nThe fairies are beyond dumb, dumber and dumbest to be funny. The\nsidekick raven-man is a non-starter as a character. The prince Charming\nfizzled as a footnote to the story. Without character interaction, no\nstory holds any interest whatsoever - ask my grandma. A timeless tale\nwas savagely pruned to the trunk. Finally; just who was this movie\naimed at?? It is too violent for kids.(PG my foot) It is too boring for\nadults. The 'twist' on the story could be seen a mile off. I was left\nwith a bad feeling that this movie was a poorly disguised feminist\nvehicle.\n"},

I wouldn't have\nloved it as much if they didn't do such a great job at explaining\nMaleficent's change to evil. Had it been all based on jealousy - i.e.\nStefan didn't marry her and became king and married someone else\ninstead - I think it wouldn't have had as much depth as it did here.\nMaleficent was a kind fairy. Even though Stefan and her dated for what\nit appears to be several years and Stefan left and didn't come back for\na long time, Maleficent still forgave Stefan and talked with him all\nnight when he did return. Her evil heart did not stem from some lost\nlove, rather, it was the betrayal of her love to Stefan plus his\nheinous act of cutting off her wings. Who wouldn't be angry at that?! I\ndon't blame her!<br><br>Aurora was also well written. She was not just some doormat princess\ncharacter like in Sleeping Beauty. It was such a sweet setup of how\nMaleficent came to truly love and care for Aurora. Maleficent watched\nover Aurora all her life (as opposed to some one off meeting that\nMaleficent had with Aurora like Aurora saved her life or something lame\nlike that and changed Maleficent's mind). I loved the nickname of\n\"beastie\" so much! it was so fitting and so cute! You can feel the\ngenuine love between Aurora and Maleficent and it just made it so much\nspecial when Maleficent's kiss woke Aurora. <br><br>I truly loved that the movie did not focus on Maleficent being an evil\nperson.

I don't\nthink Stephen had anyone caring for him or loving him, maybe it was\ncontrary - people was cruel and humiliated him. As it often happens in\nreal life, those who was treated badly in childhood and did not have\nany parent figure at all, just random people passing by, grow up to be\nsociopaths with attachment and bonding problems. Stephen could not love\nanybody, only thing he knew was how to use people to get his way. He\nmarried princess not for love but for ambitions, so, maybe Stephen DID\nconsider his daughter as a valuable property you can later use in\npolitical games (as all the kings in medieval times felt about their\ndaughters). Maleficient humiliated king when she forced him to beg on\nhis knees, also she was a threat to his kingdom - good motivation for\nwanting to kill her. <br><br>I loved the true loves kiss - (god) mothers love is as true as it\ncomes! It is much better than the concept of a cute stranger with whom\nyou have spoken once suddenly being your true love.<br><br>To those who miss villain Maleficient - have you met really, really\nevil people in your everyday life?

{"review": "\nHaving squeezed even the last commercial drop of the \"princesses\", the\nexecutives from Disney now focus their attention on the villains. And,\nundoubtedly inspired by the success of the musical play Wicked (a\nret-con prequel of The Wizard of Oz), they now bring us the story of\nMaleficient, in which her motivation for becoming the villain of the\ntale (and the movie, of course) Sleeping Beauty is revealed. The result\nis a hollow and tedious film with failed epic aspirations and lacking\nof the necessary emotion or drama in order to bring sense to its\ncloying digital aesthetic. Every frame of Maleficient is over-designed\nto the point of saturation, something which might leave the spectators\nwho only want to see spectacular landscapes and bizarre creatures\nsatisfied. That's a pity because, after all, the villains from Disney\nhave always been more interesting than the heroes or princesses, and I\nthink that Maleficient had the potential of being an interesting\ncharacter study with touches of dark fantasy. Unfortunately,\nscreenwriter Linda Woolverton doesn't show the slightest interest in\nbringing dramatic relevance to the story, and as a result, the special\neffects end up replacing the narrative, throwing as many pixels to the\nscreen as necessary in order to simulate the fact that important and\ninteresting things are happening. On the positive side, Maleficient\noffers solid performances from Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, Lesley\nManville, Imelda Staunton and Juno Temple.

Maleficent breaks\nher own curse by kissing Aurora, who she now loves like her own\ndaughter. King Stephan is driven mad and someone else becomes the\ndragon. Several knights become dragon-toast and Aurora becomes the\nhuman queen who unites with the fairy Queendom, overseen by the \"new\"\nMaleficent. (Yes, Aurora finally gets her \"Prince\"). Maleficent flies\noff into the sunset (really) with her winged sidekick and everybody\n(left alive) lives happily ever after. Dakota Fanning's sister \"Elle\"\nis so young and adorable as \"Sleeping Beauty\". Angelina Jolie plays\n\"Maleficent\" magnificently. The sexiest fairy with creepy giant wings\nand horns that you have ever seen! Should be rated PG-13. This will\ngive really little kids nightmares for years! Just as \"Pinocchio\" (the\n1950's re-release) bothered me for years: cigar smoking \"Lampwick\"\n\"morphs\" into a donkey and Pinocchio \"dies\" briefly after being\nswallowed by \"Monstro\" the Whale.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is one of those, \"You've heard this story before, but let me tell\nyou how it really happened\" films. It's a retelling/re-imagining of the\nclassic Sleeping Beauty Disney film. You have to realize that and be\nable to accept it going in, otherwise the changes may make you angry\nlike they have for some who stand firmly by the original. This isn't a\nremake of Sleeping Beauty, it's Maleficent's version of the story, so\nas you can imagine it's going to be pretty different. Personally I am\ntotally okay with that and enjoyed seeing a new version of the classic\nfairytale. Classics are classics and they will always be wonderful, but\nit can be fun to mix things up a bit.<br><br>You come to understand why Maleficent is so full of anger and why she\nwanted to target the royal family. I actually found her back story, as\nwell as the remaining storyline, pretty interesting, even if the\nexecution was a bit lacking. <br><br>Angelina Jolie definitely grew on me as the movie went on and by the\nend I was very satisfied with her as Maleficent. Also, her look is\ngreat. A lot of the other cast members I felt could have been better\n(and their characters could have been given more depth), but Jolie\nbrought enough to the film that they were forgivable. Most of the\nscreen time is hers anyway. <br><br>The visuals are very nice and help bring that Disney element to the\nmore modern film. Personified animals, imaginative creatures and\nlandscapes, visible magic spells, etc.<br><br>Like I said, it's cute and entertaining. Definitely enjoyable if you're\nopen to it, but don't expect to be absolutely blown away with\nlife-changing dialogue and deep, complicated themes. Just respect it\nfor what it is and you should have a good time!<br><br>Apparently there is a sequel set for 2017, with Jolie returning to her\nrole as Maleficent, and I'm looking forward to it. I think they can\nimprove on what is already an enjoyable film and really deliver.\n"},
{"review": "\na new vision about Maleficent needs courage. but Angelina Jolie gives\nthe inspired manner to her character to be almost credible. the\nmemories about Disney version are not easy to ignore them. but the\natmosphere, the strange parts, the evil who has new ingredients and the\ndrops of fairy tale from old fashion genre are good points for a large\npublic. part of a new perspective about classic values, reflecting\nambitious equality of chances, it is a nice exercise to transform an\nold subject. not in perfect manner but with a kind of seduction who\nseems be almost dangerous. because it reflects relativization of\nvalues. but, in essence, a nice film. and that could be only real\nimportant thing.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Maleficent\"<br><br>Angelina Jolie is Maleficent, but she is no longer the nasty and\nsophisticated demon that was considered to be one of the best villains\nthat Disney ever made, but she is now a misunderstood fairy who had\nbeen robbed of her wings and shoved into the battle that man brought\nupon her. But, it turns out that, when she curses the Princess Aurora\non the day of her birth, she grows to like Aurora (Played by Elle\nFanning) over the 16 years that she watches her. The three fairies are\nconsidered to be too thick to look after her and so Maleficent looks\nafter the girl and even raises her. Okay, this is one of my biggest\nissues with the film, couldn't there be another way around Maleficent\nlooking after Aurora than just having the fairies be thick? Couldn't\nshe just talk to her or look after her when the fairies let her walk\naround the place, like in the original? There are so many ways around\nthis topic, but they went the silly route. Negatives aside, I quite\nlike the film. Angelina Jolie is not an actress that I'm familiar with,\nbut she enlightened me in this movie. She looks the part and sounds the\npart, but the sympathetic approach can turn some people off when the\noriginal Maleficent is taken into account. No doubt, I love the\noriginal, but the new is also very good for me to see. I guess I like\nboth original and new. Princess Aurora is considered to be one of the\nworst aspects of the original Sleeping Beauty, but I have been an\nAurora fan since day one. I loved how she was portrayed here and it\nkept true to the original while giving something new. If you don't like\nnew twists on old tales, then this ain't for you, but if you're open to\nsome new ideas, then look no further.\n"},

{"review": "\nAngelina Jolie makes an excellent performance in this version of\nSleeping Beauty. This is a whole new look at the original Disney tale.\nNot only is Maleficent is a villain in this she's also a hero. Of\ncourse the real villain in this version of Sleeping Beauty is King\nSteffon. He fell in love with her as a kid and when he grew up he broke\nMaleficent's heart and took her wings. This makes sense since\nMaleficent is actually a fairy who had her wings stolen and it would've\nmade a whole lot more sense if it was actually shown in the original\nanimated version. Also it was Maleficent's love for Aurora to wake her\nup from the spell and not Prince Phillips. Also King Steffon got what\nhe deserved in the end.

The\nactress could express a wide range of emotions with just her eyes and\nexpressions. I anticipated what would awaken Aurora and I was not\ndisappointed.

So I get it now in more ways\nthan one that there can be many versions of one story. Some of the old\nfairy tales don't really teach nice things to kids, so the stories get\nchanged in modern day prints. Not only that, but even back in the\n1800's when the Grimm brothers were writing the stories down after\ntraveling around and gathering the verbally handed down stories, there\nare often two (or more) versions of the same story at that time\nfloating around!

Realistic in the sense of motivation, humanity,\nand plot I mean to say. It is still very much a fairy tale about magic\nand literal fairies, but it's something to watch and think about from a\nnew angle. If you loved the first one, and I did as a very small child,\nthen see this one not as a remake but as a completely different version\nof the same story. A \"what if\". Great stuff.\n"},

The character, Maleficent, was\nvery interesting to me when I was a child. As a kid, I thought that she\nwas just doing what bad guys do those days, do something evil without\nany valid reason. Years passed by and I heard that there was going to\nbe a film based and focusing on Maleficent herself. I was very\ninterested with the concept of the summary.

{"review": "\nThis is actually the strangest version of the fairy tale \"Sleeping\nBeauty\". The whole plot gets complicated and constantly I've been\nasking myself during the movie: \"who is the villain and who is the good\none\"? Here it seems everything messes up. The three fairies who were\nsupposed to raise Aurora properly and protect her from the curse seem\nto not do their job at all but quarrel and not know even how to feed a\nbaby. Moreover, Aurora seems free to wander into the woods whenever she\nwants, so obviously there isn't any effort from the fairies to take a\ngood care of her. I think that makes no sense at all. The main issue in\nthis tale is the \"Maleficient\" as a notion. Surely I liked the twist of\nthe tale when the evil fairy wants to break the curse because she\nbegins to like her victim. I mean, this happens, and it gives a good\nmessage in a certain point, however, there isn't a distinctive line or\ngap between the good and the evil. There are many turning points like\nwhen Stefan harms Maleficient (Stefan now is the bad guy), when\nMaleficient takes revenge (and Stefan becomes the victim of his own\nambition), and when she protects Aurora more than the three dumb and\nirresponsible fairies. Being a man doesn't mean you're definitely good,\nand being a fairy with black wings and horns doesn't mean you're bad.\nThat seems to be the moral of the story, which I find it very\ncontroversial and ambiguous.\n"},
{"review": "\nOverall I'd say it is a nice movie, but at the same time it suffers\nfrom it's own premise to put a different spin on the story.

However, they make the\nsame mistake as so many other studios/directors and underestimate the\nkids ability to understand a story with depth. Overall it simplifies\nthe new angle of Maleficent too much, which takes away quite a bit of\nthe intriguing idea to make the villain the protagonist with a\nredemption arc. Besides the flaws with the concept, the visuals are\ngreat and the acting around Jolie is decent. It's not a must-see movie\nbut still quite entertaining for the whole family if your kids are a\nbit older.\n"},
{"review": "\nI recommend people go to see this spectacular 3D film. I really enjoyed\nthe film because of the acting of Angelina Jolie, the main actor, the\nstar power Ms Jolie has as well as the visual beauty. Ms Jolie has the\nvery strong star power since she stars the vengeful fairy who helps the\ngirl. In her real life, Ms Jolie is an UN Ambassador as well as she has\nbeen trying to protect girls and women around the world from crimes\nagainst them. The film also makes spectators realize the fact that\nthere are different kinds of love in the world. I believe that people\nin any generations will enjoy the film because of the good acting of Ms\nJolie as well as the great nature.\n"},
{"review": "\nA little self-serving on Jolie's part, but still worth watching.\nInteresting take on the original version. Lovely cinematography.\nEnjoyable characters. Nice costumes. Decent special effects. A dragon.\nYou know, all the stuff that makes a good movie experience nowadays. <br><br>Although there is some serious content, this is still good family fare.\nThis is not your mamma's Sleeping Beauty however, so if you are looking\nfor the traditional, Disney story, you may be disappointed. This is all\nMaleficent. Some content may be a bit much for younger viewers.<br><br>I enjoyed the background experiences of the characters and was okay\nwith the \"re-telling\" or just plain fabrication of the story. It served\nit's purpose to \"fill in the blanks.\"\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie was beautiful, Angleina Jolie's cheekbones are magnificent,\nher horns are envy worthy and I am really enjoying how Disney is\nstarting to show the Villains side of the story. Oh and not to mention\nMaleficent's leather outfit at the end. I mean... If anything is a\n\"must see\" in the movie, it is that outfit.<br><br>Maleficent is about a fairy (named Maleficent) who, as a child, meets a\nhuman boy (Stefan). They spend a lot of time together while growing up\nand learn to trust each other. When Stefan is grown, he stops coming to\nvisit her. The next time he sees her is in a battle, years later, when\nthe corrupt King tries to invade the beautiful land that she and the\nrest of the magical creatures live in. During the battle, Maleficent\ndefeats the King and before he dies he claims \"Whoever kills Maleficent\nwill be my successor.\" Well, Stefan\u00a0 knows he can regain her trust and\nkill her to become King.\u00a0\u00a0He then drugs her and attempts to kill her\nbut cannot. His solution to still be the Kings successor? Take her\nwings from her and offer them to the King.<br><br>So from there, they fight. And this is where the story of Sleeping\nBeauty comes in. Idk - it was good, the interactions between Aurora and\nMaleficent are funny and sweet. But it felt very rushed and almost too\n\"Disney\". There's a really intense scene where Maleficent is choking\nsomeone and there is a really long pause for effect and she says \"IT'S.\nOVER.\" Now, I would typically expect some sort of profanity or a\nstronger line than that, but that's what they went with. So.<br><br>Oh. And the crow is hilarious. <br><br>Moral of the story: don't cast a spell that \"nothing on earth can\nbreak\" and there's always two sides to a story.<br><br>If you like Disney, go see it. If there are other movies you want to\nsee (Chef, 22 Jump Street, How to Train Your Dragon 2, A million Ways\nto Die in the West, Million Dollar Arm, Jersey Boys, Neighbors,\nBlended, Spider Man, The Other Woman...) Go see that instead.\n"},

Diaval is a brilliant secondary character\nthroughout movie and is well portrayed by Sam Riley. <br><br>Although, there were certain characters which caused the movie to fall\nshort of wonderful. Princess Aurora, a main character during the film,\nwas quite two dimensional and bland, making it difficult to sympathize\nwith her. <br><br>The fairies that looked after the princess as she grew, although\nextremely irritating, were adored by the children in the audience and\ngot quite a few laughs out of them.<br><br>All in all, Maleficent was a brilliant film for the family to see. An\ninteresting story, supported by good acting and complex characters earn\nthis movie an 8/10.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst off, the graphics and twist on the story are absolutely\nastonishing. Who would think to turn Maleficent into a misunderstood,\nscorned fairy warrior? Well, Disney, of course! Angelina is by far the\nbest woman ever to play the role, live-action or voice-over. Elle is\ngood as Aurora, but her sister Dakota could have possibly played it\nbetter. All in all, the story is still amazing.<br><br>Sharlto Copley can play as good a bad guy as the best of them, even\nwhen he's the opposite in real life. But all other facts aside, the\nplot, execution, and storyline twists are out of this world, making a\nlovable version of Maleficent that the whole family will enjoy. This is\nby far one of Disney's greatest live-action accomplishments, right up\nthere with Pirates of the Caribbean and National Treasure.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhen I turned on the movie, I was expecting another cheesy version of a\nfairytale or a twist on the fairytale all together. I enjoy watching\nthe original Sleeping Beauty and didn't want this to ruin it for me. I\nwas hooked the second the screen lit up with the first scene. It shows\nthe background behind what made Maleficent the way she is. It shows\nwhat made her want to put the spell on Aurora when she was born. After\nthe spell is placed, Maleficent watched Aurora from a distance. The\ndirector does a great job of showing the mystery of Maleficent by\nkeeping her in the shadows and having her wear the dark closes to show\nthe evil side of her. Maleficent interacts with Aurora off and on\nthroughout the movie. I like that Maleficent doesn't interact with\nAurora as if she was the girl that she put the spell on. Instead, she\nis more of a motherly figure and the warm in the character is\ncomforting to the person watching the movie as well as to the other\ncharacters. I like that in the end Maleficent comes out of the\ndarkness. Also, instead of falling back into the concept of a prince\nsaving the princess, the love of Maleficent is what brings Aurora out\nof her sleep. The movie overall was very enjoyable and I suggest to\nanyone that is contemplating watching it to do so. It was definitely\nworth the time.\n"},
{"review": "\nViewing the story of Sleeping Beauty through the eyes of the villain,\nwas a unique twist on the traditional fairytale where the wicked witch\nwas the true victim in this tale. The movie was compelling,\nheart-wrenching, and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I\nwas forced through a roller-coaster of emotions, finding myself wanting\nto cry out to the TV as if the characters could hear me if I did. The\nmovie pulls away from the traditional idea of \"true love\" the Grimm\nBrothers originated in stories such as Cinderella, Snow White, and of\ncourse Sleeping Beauty. The movie teaches us there is more to \"true\nlove\" than good looks and a heart stopping kiss between a prince and a\nprincess. Maleficent is capturing movie that anyone can find enjoyment\nout of.\n"},
{"review": "\nI liked this movie. I wouldn't say that this was Angelina Jolie's best\nperformance, it was like watching Lara Croft with wings, however, the\nstory was fantastic, a very good adaptation. Despite the lack of depth\nin Angelina Jolie's interpretation, the movie will keep you awake and\ninterested all the time. It is not easy to turn a hero into a villain\nand a villain into a hero at the same time, but they did it in this\nmovie. It was nice to see Imelda Stauton again after Harry Potter,\nhowever, it was like watching Dolores Umbridge again. They created a\nbeautiful fairy world with extraordinary creatures and visuals. Does\nreal love exist? Well, watch this movie and find that out. The message\nis clear. And I agree.\n"},
{"review": "\nMAY HAVE STORY LINE SPOILERS. <br><br>Growing up, Sleeping Beauty was always my favorite. Being able to\nremember the original Sleeping Beauty story will make this movie even\nbetter for you. I wasn't quite sure how this movie would turn out,\nbeing from the villains point of view. But WOWZA!!!!!! I'm in LOVE with\nthis story!!!! Absolutely NOTHING I EXPECTED. The way the writers\ntwisted the original Sleeping Beauty story line was genius!!! Very well\nmade, acting never falters. And speaking of acting. Angelina Jolie,\nwhether you love or hate her- she was phenomenal in this portrayal of\nMaleficent! I don't think any actress out there could've done it\nbetter. I stated there may be spoilers but I don't want to give to much\nbecause I want the element of surprise but from beginning to end- it\nwas so well done!!! I laughed, I cried, I felt these characters pain\nand laughter: go see it! It's worth watching!!!!!\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Maleficent\" is a live-action re-imaging of \"Sleeping Beauty\", that\nlike the Broadway Musical, \"Wicked\" based on \"The Wizard of Oz,\" tells\nthe story from the perspective of the villain or antagonist \u0096 in this\ncase Maleficent, played by Angelina Jolie. Without going into detail,\nthe first 1/3rd of the movie chronicles the character of Maleficent's\nbackground, and how she came into contact with Stefan, played by\nShartlo Copley, who goes onto to father of Sleeping Beauty herself,\nAurora, played by Ellen Fanning. That portion of the movie shows what\ndrives Maleficent to act in the manner in which she does, and in\ntelling it from the perspective of her background, empathy is created\nfor her. Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much, and found it very\ncharming. Angelia Jolie plays the character very well, and the rest of\nthe cast pretty much follows suit. The Visuals Effects while not always\nperfect, for the most part of well done. It is not outstanding, but for\nfans of the story, and if you have any affinity for fantasy in general\n\u0096 It's a nice movie. 3 \u00bc out of 4 Stars.\n"},
{"review": "\nI like it when the whole fairy tale characters and the environment were\nmade real in the film. Angelina was so believable and carried on the\nrole with glamour and fierce at the same time. But what really got me\nis how the story was re-told in a completely different point of view:\nthe villain's, which I think made the story possess some sense of\ndepth. Although this kind of approach is already familiar to some such\nas, the TV series 'One Upon A Time' wherein the writers give a\ncompletely different approach in retelling the story of each fairy tale\ncharacter.<br><br>And I think, emphasizing on what really behind the story we've all been\ntold as kids is what's really capturing and refreshing to the mind of\nthe viewers. <br><br>Eg., how a 'true love's kiss' could break the spell (who possessed the\ncurse-breaking kiss) and who is the real sleeping beauty in a\nmetaphorical sense.<br><br>I was never a fan of sleeping beauty.

{"review": "\nIt is heartening to see Disney finally on par with its creative and\nresourceful counterparts (Pixar and Dreamworks, to name but two) and\nstarting to produce new adaptations of well-known fairy tales. This\ntrend can be seen from some of the more recent animations like Tangled\nand the must-see Frozen - the \"twist-in-the-tale\" aside, the message\nand moral of these tales are appropriately adjusted to target the\naudience of the modern age. Gone are the long wait for Prince Charming\nto save the damsel in distress and save the day, and princesses must\nlearn to fend for themselves (I can't help wondering if this type of\nself-reliant princess is based on Princess Fiona in Shrek). Angelina\nJolie excels herself in the role of Maleficient and lends a dark evil\nsensual side to this traditional villain; rendering her extreme angst\nand vindictive actions understandable - in fact, all her vengeful\nmalice should be condoned, considering it was humans wronging her in\nthe first place. Though I doubt if this movie is appropriate for\nchildren with its poignant take-home messages, this is also the down\nside to this new genre of \"rewritten fairy tales\".\n"},
{"review": "\nI, like many I suspect, only went to see this movie because Angelina\nJolie was the star actraction. But not even the lovely Angelina could\nsave this movie. Again, I chose to ignore the critics and go see it.\nWhile I can say that I still enjoyed it. I have a serious thing about\nmovies that make things too \"convenient\" you'll learn what I mean if\nyou choose to go see it. The story was flat, but the visuals were\nexcellent. I'm just sad that I chose not to see it in 3D. It is\ncompletely possible to find onesself asleep during this flick as the\nstory is simple and meanders along slowly towards it's predictable, and\ninevitable conclusion. Anyone who doesn't see it coming should be\nreintroduced to every movie ever made. Still Angelina deserves at least\na 5.\n"},

{"review": "\nI love this movie! Excellent acting by Angelina! It is worth watching\nit!!!!!! This is a movie that all our children would love to tell their\nchildren in the future. Firstly, I thought this is just a movie of a\nfairy because of the introduction at the very beginning with the little\nmaleficent but later on, it turned in to a giant picture which can\nstole our hearts by the storyline. The things I wish I could change in\nthis movie are, firstly I wish the dragon had more muscle power in it\nwhen the solders trapped it down and at that scene, Angelina was\nwearing a tight black trouser that we can not imagine a fairy would\nwear.

Probably the the\nonly missed is they weren't able to convince me that she is a villain,\nhowever, it still did not bother me, maybe it just get to prove that\nvillains have goodness in them. If I were to give criticism, probably\nit is the movie being a little bit rushed I think, there were some\npoints that must have been emphasized, like how this happened or that..\nEtc. but then I am not disappointed, the graphics, effects, and acting\nis superb! It is really not a boring movie at all. I recommend this!\n"}
