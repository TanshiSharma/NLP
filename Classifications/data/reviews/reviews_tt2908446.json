{"review": "\nOn what grounds does this movie have 6,9 rating on IMDb? This insults\nthe intelligence. Shailene Woodley has no character and acts like she\nis first time in front of the camera. Action is meaningless. This is\nwhat happens when you run out of ideas. 45 minutes before the end I\nwanted to quit, but...I did not do it. Why? Because I had hoped it will\nimprove, and then... nothing. This is the most honest opinion about\nthis movie that I was able to give you. Now, I'm asking you, do you\nhave 119 minutes of your life to waste? Oh what, you do not believe me?\nNo problem! Just remember what I told you and come back after you watch\nthis piece of abomination. As regards of Kate Winslet, first I have to\nsay that I'm fan of her earlier works, but this is something else. This\nshe did not need. A huge step backwards in her career. As someone\n(Author: siderite from Romania) already said: \"Bad enough to make one\ndoubt IMDb ratings forever\".\n"},

{"review": "\nThis whole series of films revolves around Woodley's inability to\nconvince viewers she's a physical force and presence like the character\nneeds to be. You can't take a girly girl and give her a weapon and\nexpect anyone to believe she can beat people up.<br><br>Watching Woodley run in this film is silly -- she has no athletic\npresence to sell this role, and without that, the whole premise\ncollapses on itself. Never mind the overdone stereotypes around her: If\nshe's the focus, the whole story relies on her believability, and it\njust isn't there. Bad casting (i.e., see \"Twilight\" and Kristen\nStewart/Robert Pattinson) can ruin the best of stories, and this story\nisn't even good to begin with.<br><br>Otherwise, the visuals are impressive to look at, and that alone might\nbe worth the price of a rental to see how another director envisions a\npost-apocalyptic world created by a rip-off artist author.\n"},

This time, the whole\nplot is cheesy, and filled with bad twists and turns. Divergent was a\nmediocre, rushed but well acted adaptation, and Insurgent keeps more of\nthe same genes. Overall, this is a movie for fans only, I have read the\nbook, and this is a solid adaptation if it weren't for the flaws. 6/10\n******\n"},
{"review": "\nOnly a few days ago was I advised to watch a spectacular addition to YA\ncinema. I was immensely impressed with the film-making efforts and the\nscope of imagination in the world of \"Divergent\". It was only a few\nhours ago, that I confirmed that 2015 is going to be as good as last\nyear, when I was exposed to yet another sublime addition to this new\nand compelling saga. \"Insurgent\" delivers just as much as its\npredecessor but with more emotion, gravity, and exuberant ambiance. The\nbeginning and the ending combined make for a great flavoring of the\nsubstance. Shailene Woodley is a luminous bella donna of modern\nmainstream cinema and is unbeatable at what she has to offer. I am so\nglad I got to be a part of this new franchise and now I must commit to\nit as I have committed to The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner\nfranchises --&gt; with great expectations. This was indeed an honorable\nrecommendation\n"},
{"review": "\nI loved the first movie and I loved Insurgent even more. I love the\nactors and actresses, they all are new faces with talent. Also there is\nexperienced stars like Kate Winslet. I must tell, I never thought she\nwould play a villain role perfectly. You can absolutely feel the\nhatred. Also, it was great that they include love between a daughter\nand mother. Most of the movies include love between two lovers but\nnever talk about family love. It was sad that Caleb was willing to\nsacrifice her sister for his ideals. I didn't read the books so I don't\nknow if the movie seems not good enough (I think it happens for every\nsingle book) but there was nothing I would like to change about the\nmovie. Not a scene, not a line, NOTHING. When I watch a movie, even\nthough I enjoy it I always think there is that one scene that should\nnot be in the movie or should be in a different way but not for this\none. I absolutely recommend it if you like sci-fi movies.\n"},

{"review": "\nalthough it's not quite like the book, insurgent is just an amazing\nride, with really good special effects and very good acting, especially\nfrom woodley, who is outstanding! the story itself, differs from the\nbooks and it is a bit convoluted, divergent is a bit better in that\nway. Just know what you're in for, a fun action ride. Theo James was\nsurprisingly good, he gave a deep performance. Some of the main cast\nacted like they didn't wanted to be there, Ansel for example. miles\nteller was so funny and good, i really really liked peter a lot more in\nthis movie. so, watch it, it's good, but not perfect,as i said before,\nthe story could be better, it is different from the books, a lot, but\nactually, it didn't bothered me. the final sequence in the film was\nmind-blowing! i just loved it...\n"},

{"review": "\nI have read all three of the divergent series books and loved them. I\ndidn't mind the divergent film however it wasn't great. I had high\nhopes for insurgent and thought it would be amazing. But when I watched\nit, it felt very rushed and many points in the plot didn't match up\nwith the book. It was extremely hard to distinguish what was real and\nwhat was a simulation. the ending was very bad and didn't make any\nsense,plus it felt like the director over used fighting scenes to hide\nthe fact that the dialogue was not properly thought through. it was OK\nbut i would not advise it, but if you do decide to watch it make sure\nyou have not read the book first or you will be very disappointed!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nI fell in love with the characters in this one, more so than the first\none. I could feel every inch of passion within this film as if I\npersonally connected with these characters in an emotional sense, which\nby the way is something I find rare in most movies, especially sci-fi\nfilms. Though I can't stand movies altering original story lines based\nfrom novels/comics, Insurgent made it work and fitted in delightfully\nlike a missing puzzle peace. Props to the producers for that ballzy\nmove. Overall, this movie sent a rush of vivid emotion through my\nsenses; from anger to fear to being absolutely moved and touched from\nall its glory. A few scenes triggered goosebumps to soar through my\nbody in an epic sensation of emotions. I almost wanted to shed a tear a\ncouple times, but only just almost. Conclusively, this was definitely\none of the most powerful films I've seen since The Fault in our Stars,\nironically enough. Coincidence?.. hmm<br><br>Highly looking forward to Allegiant.\n"},
{"review": "\nDespite (as far as I recall) the first movie being pretty good,\nInsurgent just betrays everything that happened at the end with an\nunsatisfying explanation of why the villain is still in power.<br><br>The movie contains plot twists that a five year old could have\npredicted, and is generally lackluster in it's dialog. With a weak\nplot, boring characters, and a total disregard for all character\ndevelopment from the first movie, this was an extreme disappointment\nfor me. I will admit, there were some good scenes. But a diamond\nsmothered in cow manure isn't very attractive.<br><br>The bottom line is that I didn't connect with any of the characters. I\ndon't know if this is the case, but it seemed like they were trying to\nfit a lot of things from the book in that didn't belong. The plot\njumped all over the place, without getting to know the characters in\nthe plot or subplots. I just got out of the movie and I can only\nremember three of the characters names.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf I had not first read the book before watching the movie, it probably\nwould have been pretty great, however, I did read the book and was\nquite disappointed. As I am aware that for time purposes not every\nsingle detail can be included, though, many of the scenes and details\nthat were included occurred in a way that was unlike the way they\nhappened in the book. Several major characters were either left out\nentirely or their roles were minimized. I also felt as if there was too\nmuch fighting and action and as a result the plot line suffered. It\nseemed as if they were trying too hard to make sure the movie would fit\nthe 3D viewing style, and they forgot about the storyline.If you have\nread the book, I would recommend that you be prepared for a movie\ngenerally unlike the book in many ways. Overall though, this movie has\na beyond wonderful cast who performed BEAUTIFULLY.\n"},
{"review": "\nLet me start off by saying that I was very skeptical when I bought the\ntickets of insurgent because their were a lot of bad reviews for\ninsurgent on IMDb and I thought that divergent was bad because they\ncouldn't get tris' character right, anyways, I went to the cinema and I\ngot the tickets and I watched the movie, and I think they did a better\njob of it then the book deserves. The finally got Tris' character\nright, their was just so many details in the smallest scenes of the\nmovies. <br><br>The only con in this movie, which is a big one, is that they rushed the\nmovie a ton. There was little character development, it was just action\nscenes upon action scenes. Therefore I am going to remove 1 star\nbecause of that. So 7.3/10 For me. :)\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was great. It was gripping and beautiful. I will admit it\nwas different from the book, but personally I don't believe that was a\nbad thing. In the book, the author spends 300 + pages of Tris moping\naround because daddy and mommy died and she killed her friend. Although\nthis is still a problem in the movie, it is a lot less focused on. The\npeople who wrote this movie did something the author did not they stuck\nto a plot and left out meaningless details. They kept all of the heart\nof the book without making it drag on and on. It is worth watching in\ntheaters. As someone who read the books, I greatly prefer the\nmovies.This does not disappoint.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe most disappointing movie of 2015 so far. I was looking forward to\nit, since the Divergent was pretty consistent with just a few awkward\nspots. However Insurgent, i would call it complete trash with just one\ngoal - earn money. The visual effects were good, except for those long\nshots being made just for the 3D - like the flying above the city in\nthe end, it looked so cheap. The plot is predictable, very slow/boring.\nMost of the crucial moments are too shallow in their results. The movie\ncompletely lacks logical structure - not sure if its written like this\nin the book too. SPOLER ALERT How everyone is so OK not to guard a guy\nwho had been an enemy just few moments ago? How would whole army get to\nthe building without being noticed?\n"},
{"review": "\n. . . as only the most deluded fan-boy could argue that there's ANY\nsignificant difference between the theme and plot direction of THE\nGIVER, THE HUNGER GAMES, THE MAZE RUNNER, and DIVERGENT. This quartet\nof recent releases all share the common thread of being dumbed down\nversions of THE TRUMAN SHOW, from way back in 1998. All five of these\n\"worlds\" involve characters who are born and raised in decades-long (or\ncenturies-old) closed-system social experiments reliant upon computer\ngaming concepts to conceal the Real World from some or all of the\npopulace. TRON and SNOWPIERCER are two of the less copy-cat efforts\nalong these lines. As for INSURGENT and similar fodder of this ilk\n(including at least five more sequels planned for the ALLEGIANT HUNGER\nRUNNER clone wars), I say: stop hogging all the multiplex screens! We\nneed more films about cancer teens, kids visiting Heaven, and flicks\nbased on Nicholas Sparks novels!\n"},

I love the actors and\nthe characters they played. Was nice seeing them again. The movie is\nnot too long so you can enjoy the show. I do not understand why all the\nnegative reviews. The ending was unexpected, the movie was packed with\nstory line, humor, action scenes. I was at times on the edge of my\nseat. It is worth seeing. The story picks up exactly where the other\nmovie, divergent , left off , so there is a continuation of the action\nand story line. Love the main characters, the brother and Peter. Great\nactors.\n"},

Bad storyline, bad acting and an uninteresting story is\nwhy I see this film as a big disappointment.<br><br>If you liked the hunger Games you better wait until the next Hunger\nGames arrives in November.

{"review": "\nI really enjoyed this fast paced action adventure. Non-stop excitement\nand an actual storyline...very rare qualities in these times. Oh, and\nwhat an excellent cast. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are brilliant\ntogether. I see them as a very balanced team and both are smart at\ntheir craft. The rest of the crew were outstanding as well, each and\nevery one. I was particularly impressed by Kate Winslet...she is such a\ntalented actor. It seems very easy to be a good 'guy' and be liked all\nthe time, but an actor's true chops are exposed playing the villain.\nThe story is fast paced jammed full of necessary action. I'm not a big\nfan of CGI and special affects - but these spellbinding additions were\nso skillfully melded into to the story - they did not overshadow the\nimportance of the actors or take anything from the story. Masterfully\ndirected...this movie delivers the whole package. Unlike many other\nflicks, I did not get a sense that I was to be bombarded with money-\ngrubbing sequel after sequel. My wallet is very happy about that.\n'Insurgent' is a good movie worth a look.\n"},
{"review": "\nInsurgent uses the concepts of the books, but pretty much is just an\ninterpretation. I loved it. I loved the action. I loved how the movie\nbrought in the third books' story. After reading the books I was not\nhappy. The story made no sense, the 3rd book had no connection with the\nfirst 2 books. I felt like the story should have ended after the second\nbook. What the movie so brilliantly does is make the rest of the story\nrelevant. It feels like there is more to tell at the end of the movie.<br><br>Things I didn't like: Tris looking to boyish. not just the hair, (she\nwas beautiful in Fault in our stars), but her whole demeanour, her body\nis to masculine. It was supposedly only a \"few days later\" from where\nDivergent ended. and she looked completely different. I hated that it\nwas in 3D. Will watch it again in 2D. it wasn't done properly.\nStruggled to focus my eyes. very blurry sometimes.<br><br>Things I loved: Four. And his whole story. The changes they made to the\nstory. the Box.\n"},
{"review": "\nHaving finally just watched Divergent, I was excited to follow it up\nwith the next instalment. It helps that I love this type of movie and I\nwas not disappointed. It certainly reminds you of Hunger Games and\nmovies such as Maze Runner so it's a 'sit back and enjoy the ride' type\nof movie. Action packed with fantastic special effects, the movie takes\nup exactly where Divergent leaves off, and so flows effortlessly. Tris\nplayed by Shailene Woodley and her boyfriend/partner Four played by\nTheo James are very credible as a couple fighting Janene played by Kate\nWinslet the Leader of the five Factions. I like seeing Kate in this\nrole as it's different for her, but she plays a great bad guy.

{"review": "\nBetter than expected. Can easily stand comparison with the Hunger Games\nfranchise. In fact, I have found it more real content, if one doesn't\ncount some inconsistencies for too much. Behind all strong CGI effects\nprotrudes more depth than it appears at first sight. The acting is\nstrong too, especially by the 2 protagonists. Although no one would\nsincerely believe that Tris (Sheilene Woodley) has as much physical\nstrength as she displays here, her screen presence is intense and\ncharismatic. Her friend and partner, Four (Theo James) does a good job\ntoo, he seems to have grown as an actor. The film is said to address a\npublic of adolescents and young adults.
