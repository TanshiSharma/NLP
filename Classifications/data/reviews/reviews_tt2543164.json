{"review": "\nArrival is the best sci-fi film I've seen in my 22-year-old lifespan. I\nhaven't seen certain sci-fi films like They Live, Alien 3, or\nMetropolis, so I can speak only from the standpoint of someone who\nwatches a shitload of narrative, documentary and experimental films.\nSome of my recent favorites are Holy Motors (2012), Son of Saul (2015),\nand The Look of Silence (2015).<br><br>I just saw Arrival two days ago at the Telluride Film Fest and everyone\nin the theater had their brains cheesed out at various points in the\nfilm. For people paying close attention to every frame, the rules of\nthe film might become clear in the beginning sequences. For an Average\nJoe moviegoer like me, the film is a slow, natural process of discovery\nfrom the first scene to the last. The influences of Stanley Kubrick on\nscience fiction films has been noted time after time, but Arrival picks\nup its Kubrick vibes with it's slow sense of discovery, even if Amy\nAdams and her technology moves around the screen more frantically than\n2001: A Space Odyssey. That's why I respect this film and also why I\nlike 10 Cloverfield Lane. A lot of sci-fi films (like the new Star Trek\nreleased this summer) don't create that unfolding sense of\nscience/alien-related mystery. The way information is revealed and\npresented leaves us begging for more answers, and boy does Arrival\ndeliver. <br><br>Oscar-worthy for sure, especially in production design/special\neffects/sound. Don't blow it, go see it November 11th or whenever it's\ncoming to your town. <br><br>Bring earplugs.<br><br>Just kidding.<br><br>But seriously.\n"},
{"review": "\nPrior to approaching this film, a word of warning that it is what many\nlike to call a \"thinking person's sci-fi\". If you're going to watch\nthis, I beg that you dedicate your utmost attention to it, as it is\ntruly one rewarding experience, one of the smartest, most\nwell-constructed science fiction marvels of recent years. 'Arrival' is\nVilleneuve's magnum opus.<br><br>Firstly, to put your mind at ease, I won't be analysing the plot, thus\navoiding the use of spoilers. This decade, Villeneuve has crafted some\nfantastic works of art in the form of 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and now\nthis science fiction gem, and here's hoping his career further develops\nwith more movie masterpieces coming our way. In a world where mysteries\nremain and the possibility of extraterrestrial life still stands\nunanswered, 'Arrival' approaches this with it's clich\u00e9-free take on the\ngenre.<br><br>The relatively unknown Bradford Young provides the film with some of\nthe most stunning cinematography ever conceived, taking advantage of\nthe twilight hour to give the film its somewhat unique look, supported\nmagnificently by Icelandic composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson whose score is\nboth haunting and beautiful. If you're someone looking for a\nscience-fiction tale that keeps you guessing and thinking throughout,\nwith fantastic performances, cinematography, music and near-flawless\ndirection, then 'Arrival' is the film for you. The masterpiece of 2016!\n"},
{"review": "\nARRIVAL delivers on so many levels it's impossible to describe without\nspoilers. The book is out there, so if you really must know before you\nsee a film, read, \"The Story of Your Life\" by Ted Chiang...but I highly\nrecommend you see the movie first. Honestly. You want it to unfold as a\nwarm, fresh croissant on a chilly morning, and melt in your mouth.<br><br>From visually stimulating scenes to an unexpected score masterfully\ncomposed by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson you recognize at once this is a thinking\nfilm you'll long remember. <br><br>One scene in particular features a cloud that took my breath away.\nSure, the extraterrestrial vehicle was amazing, but that cloud... As a\nphotojournalist of nearly fifty years, I was stunned at the lifelike\ncharacter of the cloud and suspected it was real, though I knew that\nwas impossible; you can't cue Mother Nature when it's time to roll. I\nwanted to praise the CGI team for the effect, but Shawn Levy confirmed\nit was natural. They had set up to shoot this wide shot, worried about\nimpending rain, or too much wind, or the lighting being too dark for\nthe right effect, but the cloud wanted to become a star that day, and\nit rolled into frame with absolute perfection. This scene alone is\nworth a nod to Bradford Young for best cinematography.<br><br>The special effects team delivered, too. <br><br>Amy Adams performance was stunning. Sci-fi is largely disregarded when\nawards are passed out, but if the Academy neglects to acknowledge Adams\nwork in this film, I may boycott them forever. Adams is Oscar-worthy\nfor a Best Actress nomination for her character of linguist Dr. Louise\nBanks in this one, though Meryl Streep will most likely take it for\nFlorence Foster Jenkins. <br><br>It is clear the five years taken to bring this story to the screen were\nwell worth the work. <br><br>Ten well-deserved stars for ARRIVAL. I wish it a huge success at the\nbox office so this team will continue to make more films of this\ncaliber.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this last night at the opening of the Mill Valley film Festival.\nArrival is unlike any movie I've ever seen. It's about love, loss,\ntolerance, language and non-linear time, wrapped in a science fiction\nstory about our first encounter with extraterrestrials. <br><br>Under director Denis Villeneuve's masterful direction, Arrival takes\nits time to unfold, but it gradually gets under your skin and commands\nyour attention. The last half hour was one of the most emotional\nexperiences I've had at the movies in a long time. There aren't many\nmovies these days that I would call required viewing, but this is one\nof them. And Amy Adams is Oscar-worthy in the lead role. In fact,\nArrival could also win Oscars for original score, sound, direction and\nBest Picture.\n"},
{"review": "\nTo this reviewer, there are two kinds of sci fi.<br><br>The common type dates back to Buck Rogers and has more modern\niterations in Star Trek and Star Wars. Action and mayhem.<br><br>The other type, the \"smart\" or intellectual type, is harder to\nclassify. It has been around forever but appears and disappears\nrandomly. Consider the DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951/2008) or CUBE\n(1997) or the more recent MARTIAN (2015).<br><br>Or simply give it up and consider ARRIVAL the best example of the\n\"Smart\" genre ever done.<br><br>And if Ms. Adams does not get an Oscar nod for picking this film up and\ncarrying it to the finish line (oh those eyes!) this reviewer will eat\nhis review.<br><br>A must see.\n"},

All you want to do is\nsmack Amy Adams in the first 1/3 of the movie. Not a good character for\nher to play. Forrest Whittaker has the funniest accent(i think its\nBoston) you have ever heard. Totally goofy and giggle out loud funny. I\nlove SYFY movies, they don't have to be CGI, wham, bam type movies but\nthis is a total waste, gives you nothing and leave you with nothing.\nPeople will say , \"Man this really gets you thinking\", yeah it does, I\nwas thinking where the freaking nearest exist was 1/2way through the\nmovie. You are constantly waiting for the movie to get moving. NEVER\nhappens. Slow, grey, and totally un-moving. It tries to play on the\nheart strings a bit but fails dismally. I wont reveal the end but 1. If\nyou go don't blame me 2. Try not to throw your popcorn at the move\nscreen at the end, believe me you will have most of it left over.<br><br>If there was zero stars I would have given it. Total waste of time and\nmoney.\n"},
{"review": "\nHow did they get this green-lighted? Why did anyone want to make this\nfilm? I kept waiting for something to happen, butt nothing did. There\nwas a subplot of sorts, with a whispered narrative. Big chicken feet\ncame out of the mist to squirt ink blots on a glass wall. Whaaaat??\nThat's the alien encounter? I resented waiting on line to see this\nidiotic piece of crap for free. On my worst movies ever list. I was\nhoping for some great CGI, but that was not evident, either. Lots of\ngreen screening and flipping back and forth in time. Amy Adams and\nJeremy Renners performances are faultless. it's the plot that leaves\nyou wondering what is that about? Ultimately, boring and anticlimactic.\n"},

And that's it. You would\nthink that if she was successful there would be huge implications and\nif she was not successful there would also be huge implications. In the\nend, there were no implications - she wrote a book. And the book had no\nimpact on the world either. The end.<br><br>This is why I'm such a happy Netflix customer. I can give the movie\nhalf an hour to get going and when I realize that it's going to be a\nstinker (aka Fury) I can stop it and move on to something else. In this\ncase, I was trapped in a sold out theatre. When it was done everyone\njust quietly filed out. I'm pretty sure its because, like me they were\ntrying to figure out what the point was and how they got tricked into\nwatching it.<br><br>I'll give it a star though for the music score.\n"},
{"review": "\nSaw this at TIFF and was incredibly impressed. This movie has all the\nright components of an exceptional film - great cast, great director,\nand a great script that took a somewhat tired premise and turned out a\nscript full of thought-provoking substance, and a highly original\ntwist.<br><br>This movie's true beauty was how it masterfully balanced the plot and\nsub-plot throughout the entire film - to the point that the build-up to\nthe sub-plot (which also ends up being the twist at the end) is done\nvery subtly throughout the movie without the viewer even knowing for\nthe most part. It's only in the last half hour that Villeneuve starts\npresenting it's relevance for to the viewer. However, the primary plot\ndoes not suffer, it's only enriched.<br><br>This movie was an exceptional combination of great story-telling and a\ncast and crew at the top of their game delivering an entertaining film\nthat will have audiences talking about the questions it raises.\n"},
{"review": "\nCONTAINS SPOILER Not a big though.<br><br>There's a moment when Louise calls to the Chinese General, and he\nchanges his decision, and then Peace on Earth comes... they show us a\nlot of TV-screens with news from different countries, and there's also\nRussian news with the title (in Russian) \"The Government is searching\nfor Pakistani rebels\". Lol sounds like Russia was busy with other\nconcerns. <br><br>So, it was the best moment in the film. I give 1 of 10 for only this\nscene. <br><br>The rest of the movie was boring, pretentious, far-fetched pseudo-scifi\nsob story with a lack of common sense. Typical Hollywood. <br><br>I really do not understand acclaims and high ratings this movie gets.\nDid these people see the film?\n"},
{"review": "\nWell technically this is not a 1 star, but the 8.5 rating feels so\nrepulsive to me that I cannot help myself. THis movie was not good-\neven though it had all the tools to actually be good. It had decent\ncinematography (First scene when helicoptering to the ship was really\nnice actually, the way the background sounds melt into something like a\nson, really liked that) and the score was pretty nice. Some tracks are\nvery original and well produced, others are the kind of typical OST,\nbut good nevertheless. The first half of the movie had me interested,\nthe mystery was clear and how it will be solved was definitely the\nbiggest part of the movie. Unfortunately dialogues and especially the\nscenes with her kid were just off. All the scenes with the little girl\nsucked. The dialogue was bad, too clich\u00e9, too wannabe emotional. If any\nGerman read this - one line at the end of the movie is literally a\nFielmann advertisement. Literally. \"If you could relive your life one\nmore time, would you do everything just like you did before?\" No, Amy\nAdams would buy her glasses at Fielmann from the very start. Lmao. So\ndialogue is bad, and the worst thing about it is that the twist cannot\nmake up for it as it also sucks. It is obvious and feels rushed, as if\nthe writers were not sure how to pull off a real ending to this story\nand they just pushed whatever came into their mind. It was poorly\nconstructed and fairly obvious. All in all movie deserves 3-4, maximum\n5 stars. It is Interstellar in poor. If you like SciFi give it a try,\napparently many liked this movie (i do not know why to be perfectly\nhonest) and if not just stay away. Definitely not worth the watch for\nthe regular movie watcher.\n"},
{"review": "\nI love SF, but I didn't love this. First, it is slow. It is so slow I\nnearly fell asleep. People were leaving the theatre. Agonisingly long\nshots of the heroine with quivering lip trying to show fear, instead\nshowing angst and indecision. 'Mood' shots that bore. Repetitive motifs\nthat are simply dull. Second, it tries to be dramatic and fails.\nHorribly. Overly loud music/sound effects (think Cloverfield without\nthe menace), super-slushy strings for emotional scenes that are not\nthat emotional and I found it difficult to care about, and a score that\nis just odd, like bad ambient music. Third, the actual story is nothing\nspecial. Heroine is called in to save the day, after difficulties, she\ndoes. Wow. The 'reveals' are not exceptional, and the whole basic\npremise of the film, the 'thing that makes it special' is so contrived\nthat no matter what happened or you wanted to happen could be inserted\nand explained away. It's like a McGuffin. Fourth, the plot has a\nglaring hole in it, you wonder why 'they' did what they did in tat way.\nIt just doesn't make sense. I liked the idea of the film, but the\nexecution was really poor. Sunday evening with partner on the sofa,\nunder a blanket with a bottle of wine.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am not impressed by the movie. It was too trivial for my personal\ntaste. All that happens in the movie can be summed up in the following\nbullet point: protagonist has flashbacks and nightmares, protagonist\n\"communicates\" with aliens, miscommunication occurs, they resolve the\n\"problem\", movie ends. <br><br>But that's not even what really bugs me out about the movie. Lets talk\nsome real science here. I have been studying languages too and I am a\nphysicist by trade so I think that I am more than qualified to make a\njudgement call. The biggest flaw of the movie is that it makes\nabsolutely no sense. Apart from the fact that the aliens just started\nto scribble everything down instead of communicating vocally (If you\nwere in a foreign country where people didn't speak your language you\nwouldn't just start scribbling things down). It's impossible to\ndecipher a completely unknown language without prior knowledge about\nthe syntax and etymological nature of the aforementioned language. If\nwe were unable to decipher the Voynich manuscript for over 500 years we\nwon't be able to decipher an alien language in a mere month. That's\njust a fact. Sorry<br><br>Both protagonists are technically superfluous. Everything that they've\ndone in terms of deciphering the language could've been achieved in a\ntimely fashion by simply utilizing ML (machine learning) algorithms. I\nknow this to be true because that's what I'm currently doing for a\nliving.<br><br>The movie ends with one of the protagonists asking the other: \"You\nwanna make a baby?\" How very classy and romantic... (Sarcasm)<br><br>Concluding remarks: the whole \"they have a non-linear understanding of\ntime\" babble is pseudo-scientific hokum. Time is linear (because of\nentropy). I hate it when people pervert the hard sciences like that.\n"},
{"review": "\nNote: This is a personal review based on my preference and likes.<br><br>I wanted to like this film, given I was hoping for a scifi film that\ndidn't hang on the action to make it great. This wasn't that film.<br><br>The film is slow, constantly throwing out flashes of depressing content\nand making loud, unnecessary noises to try to create an atmosphere. The\naudio effects especially put me off the 'big' moments, i'd have\npreferred mysterious or subtle effects instead of glaring ones the film\nused.<br><br>It reminds me a great deal of the game Firewatch, where on one hand you\nhave this amazing thing and on the other a constant reminder of pain\nand suffering. Perhaps some people enjoy this contrast but I didn't, it\nruined the best parts of the film by constantly dragging you back in to\npainful parts.<br><br>So for me this gets a 2 for: - Poor Audio - Sad Parts break up the\nstory, take those out and it would be passable. At the very least just\nshow them once.. - Poor Audio - Desire to leave the cinema before the\nfilm ended, felt bored + Thinking out of the box and being a little\ndifferent + Special Effects and camera use, some very nice shots in the\nfilm\n"},
{"review": "\nI am a huge Sci Fi fan and was looking forward to this new movie\nstarring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. The trailer drew me in instantly\nbut within 30mins of the movie hardly anything was happening. It is one\nof the slowest paced movies I have sat through. The catch phrase that\nappears on the movie poster is 'Why are they here?' After two hours\nsitting in a cinema my response is WHO CARES. This movie had potential\nbut should have been a short film instead. The story could have been\ntold in 20mins. Dumbest looking aliens ever that would be best served\non a seafood platter because there is no way those things could have\nbuilt a spaceship let alone taken it to earth. Sci Fi can be other\nworldly but the level of sophistication these aliens apparently\npossessed stretched the borders of imagination to the ridiculous. This\nis a movie that contemplates its navel and finds only fluff there.\nSpend your money elsewhere\n"},
{"review": "\nThe film is definitely inspired by Christopher Nolan's film\nInterstellar and had a lot of potential with an interesting\nperspective. The visual side is certainly good. Unfortunately, there\nare more plot holes and several omissions. No explanation is given\nabout the coming of the ETs and their 'innocent' goals (to share\nknowledge). In essence, this is too much a philosophical drama\nsurrounding the protagonist (Dr. Louise Banks) and less insight into\nthe ETs. Unfortunately implausible plots in such a situation. Same\nparallel with 'Interstellar' for some unknown reason, ET's decided to\naid mankind, who is being put as the center of attention in this solar\nsystem. It is unknown why the ET's put up with all the human nonsense.\nCertainly the movie is not thought out well enough to this point. If we\nview the movie as a science-fiction flick it fails, but as a\nphilosophical drama, it has some potential if you ignore the\nunexplained paradox that occurs with the metaphysical.\n"},
{"review": "\n100% on Rotten Tomatoes? WTF?! I'm a big sci-fi movie fan especially if\nits story is quite philosophical and cerebral which IS the case with\nArrival, but it got bogged down in the complexities of showing how\nhumans would communicate with a superior alien intelligence amidst a\ndistrusting and violent Earth society. Figure out how to communicate\nquickly enough with the aliens in order to prevent war is the main\npremise.<br><br>I got confused. There are dream like flashbacks that at first don't\nmake sense, combined with a lot of Amy Adam's long drawn out ogle eye'd\ntearful stares of bewilderment morphing to fear bordering on amazement\nas she attempts to communicate and build a vocabulary as a translator\nwith the alien entities. Yes! Great visuals and audio to keep me\ninterested in how this was done.<br><br>But this movie relies heavily on building tension this way from an\naudience with high expectation and anticipation of what's going to\nhappen next with a pay out that is a bit of a let down, drawn out and\nconfusing to keep up with. I actually was struggling to keep from\ndozing off, but that may be from my trying to beat the anticipated\ncrowds (going Rotten Tomatoes 100% review) at a midnight viewing the\nday before Friday release. There were just a handful in the audience\nthat night.<br><br>Besides I was expecting something more profound than Jodie Foster's\n\"Contact\", a much better movie at relying on audience expectation and\nanticipation from experiencing a unique imagining of what it would be\nlike to communicate with extraterrestrial alien intelligence that also\nexplains how they overcome the limitations of space travel. \"Arrival\"\ndoesn't even go there.

Please consult E.O. Wilson for all future alien films,\nbecause no advanced species capable of space travel would look like\nthat. They wouldn't travel in a giant cloudy rock, they would have some\nsemblance of opposable thumbs, and would have the ability to use their\nappendages to manipulate tools.

{"review": "\nMost of the 'sci-fi' from big studios feels more like watching someone\nplaying a video game, with maximum action per-frame. Not that there's\nanything wrong with that. To my mind, great sci-fi makes the viewer\nthink about stuff they never considered. Or ponder mundane things in\nunimagined ways. I found Arrival immensely satisfying in the way my\nfavorite sci-fi books did. Like Clarke's Childhood's End or Card's\nEnder series, the scope of the story continues to build - as do the\nrepercussions. The story ends at a very different place ....or at least\nwith the attentive viewer in a very different place than they were\nlikely at when the movie began. I must say, the quiet yet unsettling\nway the film begins had me hooked from the start. I admit I had\nflashbacks to the chills I had on 9/11 when it finally hit me that\n'everything has instantly changed in ways I couldn't imagine. What do I\ndo now?' And I ended up going through the mundane motions trying to\ninternally digest this profound and jarring paradigm shift. If you want\nan action flick like Independence Day or Armageddon, look elsewhere. If\nyou want a film that stays with you and haunts you - like Children of\nMen... then maybe you'll like Arrival. Everyone in the cast and crew\ndeserve every accolade and award they're nominated for. Above all, if\nthis film isn't nominated for 'best adapted screenplay' there is no\njustice. I have not seen a film that lived up to my unrealistic\nanticipation in a long long time. Arrival is truly special and I hope\nbecomes a classic of the sci-fi genre. It's too soon to tell, but I\nwould not be surprised if it ends up at or near the top of most folks'\ntop sci-fi films (or simply story) lists. Profound thanks to everyone\nwho had a hand in making this haunting, eye- opening film.\n"},

{"review": "\nFor the first time in my 11 years of watching movies I am able to say I\nhave a new favourite. I've waited for this moment ever since I watched\nThe Lord of the Rings trilogy, doubting it would ever actually come. I\nwas almost there with Interstellar, but it still couldn't top the\nmasterpiece that marked my childhood. Today, however, I can proudly say\nI watched my new favourite movie, that being Arrival. Subtle and\nthought-provoking, Arrival managed not only to meet my high\nexpectations, but exceed them completely. I stared in awe every time\nthe camera began focusing on the enigmatic ships called \"Shells\". I\ncouldn't help but smile when I understood the main plot point and the\nfantastic twist. The acting is top notch with Amy Adams giving an\nOscar-worthy performance and Forest Whitaker and Jeremy Renner at the\ntop of their game. For me it was perfect, as it gave me a new\nperspective and a new matter to think about. I strongly encourage you\nto see it, preferably in cinema, for the best experience. That being\nsaid, I hope my tiny review was helpful and that it gave you enough\nreasons to watch this masterpiece of modern cinema.\n"},

Truly, I am pretty easy going when it comes to movie\ncritiques - but this movie essentially blew a big snot ball all over me\nduring the last 10 minutes. I was expecting some kind of marvelous\nrevelation or amazing \"ah-ha!\" moment; but when the credits began to\nroll, I realized that was not happening. Nothing was ever really\nexplained. I won't give away any spoilers away but what really\nirritated me was when the aliens were asked \"the real important\nquestion\" the answer they give is - well - you go and watch for\nyourself if you really want to know. This movie is just a bunch of\ndepressing, dreary scenes, and mostly boring, but sometimes the lead\nactors do use some really scientific dialog. I was not impressed nor\nsatisfied with any part of the movie. At the very least, I was hoping\nto enjoy watching the usual perky and cute Amy Adams, but alas she was\ndepressed and frumpy throughout this one. Even the cinematography is\nbland, gray, and utterly lackluster. Then there are the alien space\nships, which you have no doubt already seen in the trailers (or the\nmovie poster), look like grey cow-pies flipped on their sides. So to\nyou good folks out there reading this I say nay-nay on this flick. The\nonly redeeming part of this movie is that I was able to spend some time\nwith my family watching it together, then later discussing how empty it\nleft us all with the ending, so maybe that was worth the $38.00 we\nspent on the tickets.

{"review": "\nGreat cinematography and most of the dialogue was solid. There are some\nglaring plot issues that you don't need to look into too deeply to\nreveal = SPOILER ALERT = ..... It asks us to accept that these aliens\nare way more advanced than us (spacecraft tech; interstellar\ncapabilities; non linear time sensing capacities etc) - and yet believe\nthey would need basic language teaching. Even if you disregard the fact\nthat they would already know the teachings (as they know the future! -\nso upon meeting they already will have had those lessons and know the\nteachings); they are so advanced they would have detected our crude\ncommunication via TV/Radio etc and would have learned all earth\nlanguages prior to the \"teacher\" meeting them. It of course then means\nshe has no teaching role in the movie and kind of kills the plot. But\nit is an inconvenient truth all the same. Also the sacrifice of the\nblown up alien would be preventable (they would know the future and so\nhave been able to stop the incident) - but it somehow served as a\nSECOND COMING sacrifice to humanity and so am sure that even though it\nwas predictable and therefore almost certainly preventable (precog\nstyle) - it could well have been put in as a Jesus v2.0 sacrifice. <br><br>Another slight plot issue is that the father of the child is not in the\n\"flashbacks\" (turned out to be premonitions) even though she would\nsurely know who her future husband is (as well as future daughter). Of\ncourse, it had to be that way as showing who that is (will be) would\ngive away the fact she sees the future (when we are led to believe we\nare seeing flashbacks)...<br><br>I don't think it was as gripping and realistic as Contact.

On the one hand,\nthere's the brilliant way 'Arrival' was directed which makes me love\nit. It keeps you both excited and ambiguous at the same time if you can\nfollow the rhythm. On the other hand, you've got the plot that is kept\nlike a mystery in a magical chest. However, the end is very explicit, I\ncan say, so that the general public should understand this film pretty\ngood despite all the turns and flicks. There's nothing really special\nabout the acting, but the visual effects were awesome.<br><br>The idea of the film is original. Very original, actually, though a bit\nstrange and confusing.

Another one is that\nthe ending both confuses and leaves you like: \"That's it?\" because\nsomething will be pointless.

{"review": "\nThe movie tackles one of the infamous questions that we are still\nstruggling to answer or at least to find a way how to answer: who are\nwe and are we really alone?. Before the release of the movie I had some\nheated debate with some linguists about the possibility of humans to\nunderstand a completely different semiotic communication pattern than\nwe. The movie goes around the idea that heptapods communicate through\nsome pictographic writing system that use it to communicate with us. Is\nit only designed for us or they use that system to communicate between\neach other. I use French when I'm talking to French who don't\nunderstand English. One thing that I has some reserves about the movie\nis that the fact in a matter of weeks they have reached an\nunderstanding of this complex pictographic language while we, humans,\nfailed to even decipher some of the ancient language of of our fellow\nspecies and there are some languages that are still a mystery till now.\nConsequently, it would not be a cinch to decipher such complex system.\nAlso, the link between this pictographic language and its ability to\nreveal the future was not well spoken and it didn't burn well.

I was expecting the movie would show more\nof the process of understanding the language of aliens which looked\nvery interesting with the circular patterns and all. I wished the movie\nexplored more of that. I think it lacked focus because it continuously\nwent in flashback which I did not understand the significance of. I\nthink there is a deeper concept underlying the story which the director\nwas not able to convey properly. The cinematography was also not all\nthat great. I liked the alien's spaceship. Also liked the idea of\ngraphical written language in a circle which is faster to write. Wanted\nto see a lot of communication between aliens and humans which didn't\nhappen. The protagonist's personal life story was unexpected and not\nrequired. A rare movie where aliens are not attacking. Peace.\n"},

Both\nof them do what is essential to interact with these entities, or\naliens, to get to the bigger picture and ask bigger questions like what\ndo they want from us?<br><br>The movie does not only contain these conversations. Those are just the\nmain pathway around which the whole story is build like a big city. The\ninvolvement of others, people's reaction to this event, mistrust among\nworld powers are all things considered by the writers. This is what\nmakes the movie special. <br><br>So, I will suggest that sit back and enjoy this movie.

I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping to be. <br><br>I admired the style and the imagery of the film. I enjoy nearly all\nscifi and I particularly enjoyed this director's previous big movie,\nSicario, about the drug war in the Southwest and Mexico. However, I was\nunexpectedly bored most of the time while I was watching this one. For\none thing, as is true of most hard scifi scripts, the majority of\nordinary humans are dismissed as hysterics or religious zealots. That\nleft me cold. Any movie that casts Forest Whitaker, no matter how many\nawards he has, is going to make me wish all of his scenes had subtitles\nas a hurriedly mumbles through all his lines. Finally, the whole \"the\nworld as we know it will melt down into an apocalyptic disaster unless\nour hero gets this right\" is almost always an unconvincing crisis. I\nnever felt like anyone was really in the kind of imminent danger the\nauthor wanted me to feel, so all there was to do was admire the scenery\nand the occasional special effect. The story needed more characters,\nmore tension between them, and more interesting and less predictable\ndialog. Nice try.\n"},

All I will\nsay is that the film is more about the final message than any character\ndriven drama. It took me a good 10 minutes of reflection after leaving\nthe theater to soak everything in and I found Arrival to be a very\ncryptic film, and a film that is very relevant to real world events.\nIt's not so much a science fiction film but more of a spiritual film,\nand a film that will make people take a close look at themselves, our\ncivilization and humanity in general.

The action content here is negligible though, which renders\n'Arrival' refreshingly different from most other first contact movies\nas the film focuses on credible barriers with alien communication. The\nbig question is whether the aliens are hostile or peaceful since it is\nimpossible to understand them. The communication theme is not limited\nto the aliens though; with spaceships landing in twelve places around\nthe world, issues arise from various countries being unwilling to share\ninformation. Much like 'Under the Skin', the film also highlights\nhumankind's tendency to always react violently to what we do not\nunderstand, but there is actually a positive tone overall. The film has\nsome pacing issues though. The conclusion is overly drawn out (with at\nleast a couple of false endings) and the final few scenes only serve to\nblatantly spell out plot twists and turns that did not need to be\nexplicitly stated. The scenes of various young military personnel\nhaving their doubts also distract from the protagonist's journey.\nWhatever the case, Amy Adams is solid in the lead role. Villeneuve lets\nhis camera focus on her trembling hands as well as her face, allowing\nher to give a true full body performance. Strong support also comes\nfrom Forest Whitaker and Jeremy Renner even if it sometimes feels like\nthey could have been given more to do.\n"},
{"review": "\nDirector Denis Villeneuve (Sicario - 2015) provides a new look at the\n\"alien\" film, giving both a new space craft to marvel and explore, new\nalien sounds, and a different kind of creature to interact with. For\nthese reasons alone, the film is a success. However, with a complicated\nscreenplay by Eric Heisserer (based on a short story by Ted Chiang), it\nis the backstory that continually gets in the way of an otherwise\nintriguing viewing experience. Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker) calls\nin linguist Amy Adams (exceptionally terrific here) and Scientist\nJeremy Renner (playing second fiddle to Adams) to decode the alien\nchat. All is well and exciting until Adams starts having\nflashbacks/forwards (I couldn't tell) that somehow relate to the story\nand hold the secret to the world not falling into despair. When the\nfilm ended, I couldn't help but wonder \"what happen\"? Music is at times\npredictable Sci-Fi (J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson), yet it is equally calming and\nhelps move the mystery of the experience along nicely. Cinematography,\nespecially inside the spacecraft, is terrific by Bradford Young. You'll\nprobably read that \"Arrival\" is the \"Close Encounters\" of our day\nand/or that the film is Stanley Kubrick oriented. Well I say, it's just\nanother alien film that manages to provide a fresh look at a genre we\nknow well.\n"},
{"review": "\nDirected by Denis Villeneuve, and adapted from Ted Chiang's The Story\nof Your Life [1998], Arrival explores how mankind would react to, and\ncommunicate with, extraterrestrial beings, who without warning and with\nan unclear purpose, touch down in twelve locations across the earth.<br><br>Threatened by their arrival a team of specialists, led by linguist Dr\nLouise Banks (Amy Adams) and scientist Ian Donnelley (Jeremy Renner),\nare tasked with communicating with the aliens, and ultimately deducing\nwhether they have peaceful or hostile intentions.<br><br>Perhaps surprisingly Arrival is not just a film about an encounter with\nextraterrestrials, but is at its core a heartfelt and visceral look at\nmore universal and ideological themes of love, loss, tolerance and\nacceptance, to name a few.<br><br>Acting, particularly from lead Amy Adams, is superb with scenes of\ngenuine emotion and delicate intimacy throughout. J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's\noriginal score matches this sentiment well, with deep and resonating\ncrescendos and delicate strings, which create subdued and deeply moving\nscenes. <br><br>Though the scenario of aliens landing on earth could be viewed as\nclich\u00e9 and overdone (Close Encounters of the Third Kind [1977],\nIndependence Day [1996], Contact [1997], etc.), it is ultimately in the\nfinal act where Arrival steps into new ground, and transforms into a\nmovie that demands your attention and reflection long after the credits\nhave rolled.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe film has one interesting idea: that time isn't linear.<br><br>Reaching that idea is a plod so slow that I almost left the cinema.\nEverything about it is dull: from the dreary cinematography under\nleaden skies and gloom, ghostly Death Eater aliens lost in fog,\ndialogue that's lost in mumble.<br><br>I almost enjoyed the clich\u00e9s (America saves the world, the military are\nthickos) because at least they produced interest.<br><br>Did I mention the gloom? It's soooooo dull that you almost need a pair\nof night vision glasses to find some light.<br><br>The acting from Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner is good though and the\nfinale is decent enough if rather obvious by that point: time isn't\nlinear. Wow. Great. Never been done before.<br><br>If you want atmosphere in an alien encounter then ALIEN is in a\ncompletely different league to this. If you want alien mysticism, which\nis basically how the language is transferred, then The Abyss did it\nyears ago in almost exactly the same way. And that's about it.<br><br>I so wanted this to be better.\n"},
{"review": "\nThere are many films coming out this year that far exceeded my\nexpectations but Arrival is at the top of the list. This is not only\narguably one of the greatest films of the year but one of the greatest\nscience fiction films ever. The story follows linguist professor Louise\nBanks-played by Amy Adams- who is assigned to help the military\ncommunicate with a group of unusual extra terrestrials. However, the\nsituation is slowly falling apart as many people are starting to worry\nthat the aliens might have sinister motives. The premise alone doesn't\nsound like anything too great but it is truly the execution that is\nwhat makes the difference. Amy Adams and Jeremy Reiner play well off\none another as both colleagues and love interests. The special\neffects-even the CGI-are also beautiful and completely realistic. But\nthat is the great strength of this film: it's ultra-realism. The\nscenarios, the dialogue, the science, the language, all of it could\npossibly happen in real life. That's what makes it so absorbing. It's\nnot a feel good movie like Independence Day but a thinking man's film\nthat's still very entertaining like 2001 Space Odyssey. But the best\npart is the ending. It might be confusing at first but if you think\nabout it, you will begin to understand it. Arrival is definitely one of\nthose movies you need to see twice in order to fully understand it. If\nyou enjoy films that make you think twice about what you saw, then\nArrival should be at the top of your list. With great acting, direction\nand special effects, Arrival is totally worth a second look.\n"},
{"review": "\nWent to see \"Arrival\" tonight: If you are only a Sci-Fi fan for movies\nthat have lots of action, this movie is not going to be for you and I\ndo not suggest you going to see it as you will find this film very slow\nand boring....However if you like Sci-Fi movies such as Interstellar,\nPredestination, Contact, etc.....you will want to give this movie a go!\n\"Arrival\" was beautifully shot with a refreshingly non traditional look\nfor an alien specie for the big screen. The movie has a thought\nprovoking take on communication and the possibility of a greater\nability once comprehended. Keeps you thinking throughout the film and\nwell afterwards. Amy Adams is brilliant as usual and though a strong\nsupport cast was not really needed for this one, Jeremy Renner &amp; Forest\nWhitaker were both solid and complimented Adams nicely.......If this\nsounds like it might be up your alley, I definitely recommend it.\n"},
{"review": "\nArrival is a more realistic and logical take on the idea of an alien\nencounter. This is probably pretty much how it would really go if some\nnon-hostile aliens arrived in our planet. Of course in order to avoid\nalienating the audience, the film doesn't go very technical on the\nlinguistics and how they are translating between languages. But they\nshow good enough to keep it logical and real. This film doesn't pull\nout a gun right in your face for dramatic effect. There are no nuclear\nexplosions, energy shields, battle drones coming out of the mother\nship. The alien ship is like a curious wild animal in the woods and we\nare trying to connect with it without scaring each other, or vise\nversa. Both sides are not sure if this can all go smoothly and\nfriendly. And the protagonist, a female character just like in Contact\n(1997), represents us and successfully connects with the aliens. But\nthere are other ships around the world and not all of them are as\nsuccessfully interacted. At this point human civilization must abandon\nthe paranoia against themselves and against aliens. This is the\nhumanity's ultimate test. Which reminded me The Day the Earth Stood\nStill (1951) where the humanity is tested in a similar way when the\nalien(s) refused to speak to one nation only. And in case of failure\ndestruction is inevitable. There is also a subplot, which is integral\nto the story, that tells the tragedy of losing a child. All in all,\nthis is a very well done film. Amy Adams' performance worth mentioning.\nAmong all these endless stupid superhero films of nowadays, this surely\nfelt good.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film has been getting rave reviews everywhere I have seen and i\nhave now seen arrival and I really enjoyed this film. The premise of\nthe film sees an expert on languages recruited by the us army to\npossibly communicate with an alien threat. Amy Adams plays Louise the\nexpert on languages in this film and she is fantastic in this film. She\nis easily the most interesting character in this film and the character\nthat you care about the most. She is a pretty tragic character and you\nreally feel sympathy for her as the film progresses but she is a strong\ncharacter as well. Jeremy renner is really good in this film and adds\nallot to his character that just makes him a likable guy that works\nvery well with adams in this film. Forest whitaker is good in this film\nas the army colonel, he is a fair character that adds a sense of\nrealism to the film. This Is also the same for all the characters in\nthe bunker and from the other nations that add to this film. The story\nhas a really interesting take on the typical alien invasion that ha me\nsurprised and really interested. There's a twist towards the end that\ngave This film a real uniqueness to it that I really liked. However,\nthe film ha very little resolution involving the aliens and I found\nmyself with more questions then answers at the end of the film. The\nscript was great it has some great dramatic moments and dialogue in it\nthat makes you care about the characters. Also the film has a dry sense\nof humour that does work especially for renners character. The style of\nthe film is absolutely gorgeous, this film has the best cinematography\nof any film This year. But this film has incredibly slow pacing. At\ntimes it does work because it gives it's characters more time to\ndevelop but it does make this film seem longer then it actually is and\ndrags. Overall this is a really good film that is definitely worth\nseeing.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have just seen the arrival and overall it is a good movie. If you are\nexpecting to see some serious fights and mind blowing action scenes\nbetween aliens and humans well this movie is not for you. The arrival\nis a very human movie around 12 alien space crafts showing up overnight\nand the events fallow the incident. It allows the audience to be able\nto see the human nature and all our primitiveness behind our technology\nand science. Throughout the movie one can see how hostile and paranoid\nwe can be towards each other as humanity and as nations. We have very\nlittle faith in unity and almost every time we prefer fighting over\nreasoning. The story is good and catchy. Acting is also good. A good\nsci-fi movie with a story to tell...\n"},
{"review": "\nAnother year, another highly anticipated film from acclaimed director\nDenis Villeneuve, the director of \"Prisoners\" and \"Sicario\" is back at\nit again this time in the science fiction genre with \"Arrival\" starring\nAmy Adams and Jeremy Renner. \"Arrival\" based off of the novel \"Story of\nYour Life\" follows expert linguist Louise Banks played by Amy Adams,\nwho during an extraterrestrial invasion is contacted by the U.S.\nmilitary to try and decipher their alien language, trying to find out\nwhat their purpose on earth is, do they want peace? Do they want war?\nOr maybe something else? Well that's for Louise to find out, but\n\"Arrival\" isn't really about that, it's a love story, it's a sort of\ncoming of age story, a film about healing and revelation, beautifully\ntold by Denis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer. \"Arrival\" doesn't\nquite measure up to other works from Villeneuve, but it stands as one\nof the best science fiction films of the last 5-10 years.\n"},
{"review": "\nArrival is a science fiction film starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner.\nEasily one of the most thought-provoking films I have seen since\nInterstellar, it is a must-see for anyone who enjoys cleverly written\nsci-fi.

A special team is\nassembled by the US military, led by Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker),\nto attempt to communicate with the aliens.

Director Denis\nVilleneuve's creative use of cinematography and long shots inside the\nalien spacecraft is very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space\nOdyssey. I think he's a great choice to direct the upcoming Blade\nRunner 2049. Amy Adams gives an excellent performance in the role of\nDr. Louise Banks. There was never a moment in the film where her\ncharacter felt unbelievable or forced. I highly recommend it to anybody\nwho enjoys science fiction with something intelligent to say.<br><br>I rate it 8.5/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI've chance to see this movie at the festival UTOPIALES 2016 in Nantes\n(France) the 31 October, before the official release date in\nFrance(07/12/16).

{"review": "\nI was expecting a good movie as I enjoyed the recent Prisoners and\nSicario by the same director. This turned out to be a GREAT movie! If\nyou've seen the trailer you'd be forgiven for thinking this is a\nstandard alien invasion film, and perhaps that you've seen all the best\nbits already. But Arrival is clever, contemplative and dreamlike, and\nnot short of surprises. Amy Adams is wonderful and her character\ncarries the entire film. In fact, for a film about aliens, the\noverwhelming theme is of humanity. The main message is one that is\nextremely important to me - we are all in this together and\ncommunication is the key.\n"},
{"review": "\nArrival may be marketed as a creepy alien invasion movie, but rest\nassured, Arrival has more in common with offerings such as 1951's The\nDay the Earth Stood still, Contact or The Man from Earth than it does\nID4, or something of that ilk. <br><br>Arrival is the newest output from Denis Villanueve, if you are not\nfamiliar with his work, think of Christopher Nolan, if Nolan knew how\nto compose a beautiful shot and write endings.<br><br>Amy Adams stars as the brainy linguist, brought in by Uncle Sam to\nattempt to figure just how in the hell to communicate with the alien\nrace, who have inexplicably appeared out of the night and seem to be\nhappy to more or less loiter in a number of creepy looking spacecrafts\nall over the planet. <br><br>To get into plot points would be quite spoilery and therefore we'll\nsuffice it to say that Arrival is a brilliantly crafted film with\nvisually arresting camera work and a haunting score.<br><br>At this point I'm comfortable in placing it into the top 5 of 2016.\n"},
{"review": "\nDennis Villeneuve has created yet another excellent feature to add to\nhis growing list of hits. Arrival is a visually stunning, thought\nprovoking film that will keep the audience captivated from beginning to\nend. If you've seen Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, you'll notice\nmany similar elements that have come to be a custom of the Sci-Fi\ngenre. <br><br>Arrival follows the protagonist Louise, a college professor and a\nleading figure in language translation, as she attempts to understand\nan alien language in hopes of answering one simple question, what it is\nthat brought them to Earth.12 alien ships, giant black totem shaped\nstones, spread throughout earth with its' intents unknown to the world.\nIt starts off as a race between nations to discover the secret of\ncommunicating with these beings. I would best describe them as tall\noctopus like creatures, with each of their long tentacles being used as\ntheir way of communication, releasing ink to create shapes and figures.\nThere's a concise message on just how important language is to\ncivilizations, and how the slightest misinterpretation could lead to\ndevastating results. <br><br>My last take away will be to praise Villeneuve's pacing of the film, he\ndoes it in such a way that reveals nothing too soon, but at the same\ntime just enough to let the audience decide for themselves what the\nculmination of everything they've seen is leading towards. I look\nforward to watching the future work of an incredible film maker.\n"}
