{"review": "\nAfter a brief prologue showing us how Sm\u00e9agol came to get the ring and\nhow he came to be the pitiful creature we know the film proper starts\nwhere The Two Towers left off; Sm\u00e9agol is continuing with his plan to\nlure Frodo and Sam to their doom in Shelob's lair and Gandalf, Aragorn,\nLegolas and Gimli are reunited with Merry and Pippin at Isengard.<br><br>When Pippin looks into the palant\u00edr, a sort of dark crystal ball, he\nsees the city of Minas Tirith under attack, unfortunately he himself is\nseen by Sauron. Galdalf takes him to Minas Tirith when he rides there\nto warn of the impending attack while the others remain behind to raise\nan army large enough to assist in that coming battle.<br><br>I thought that the battle of Helm's Deep was impressive but it seems a\nmere skirmish compared to the battle of Minas Tirith, here there are\nthousands of Orcs supported by mercenaries mounted on gigantic elephant\nlike creatures that are large enough to crush a man and his horse under\ntheir giant feet. All the time this battle rages Frodo and Sam are\njourneying deeper and deeper into the land of Mordor to Mount Doom in\norder to end Sauron's reign once and for all.<br><br>This is probably the best film of the trilogy, I can see why it raked\nin the awards, the only weakness was the epilogue once the quest was\ncompleted the film could have ended at the crowning of the king rather\nthan going on to their return to the Shire... even though I'm aware\nthat this was in the book. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job bringing\nsuch an epic story to the screen, he was of course assisted by a\nfantastic cast who really brought the characters to life.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King\" is the third and final\ninstallment of Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien's famous fantasy\nnovels. Once again the makers of the film have taken care with the\ncostumes, sets, scenery, models, CGI effects and Howard Shore's epic\nscore to create a convincing depiction of Middle Earth.<br><br>Once again the cast delivers expert performances. John Noble joins the\ncast as Denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and\nrepugnant character. Three of the performances in the film were\nparticularly memorable for me. Bernard Hill once again brings authority\nto the role of King Theoden and his inspiring presence on the\nbattlefield left me in awe. Miranda Otto brings strength to the role of\nEowyn and makes the character's best moments unforgettable. Ian\nMcKellen once again brought his commanding presence as Gandalf to bear\nas he tried desperately to hold everything together.<br><br>This film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking\nTolkien's work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. The\nfamous battle at Minas Tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best\nfantasy battle ever filmed. As with the first two films, I found the\nadded scenes for the extended addition interesting, but they didn't add\nmuch above and beyond the already great theatre cut.\n"},

{"review": "\n\nIn Return of the King - which follows the book (that I have not read, though\nheard what is in it that is not in the film) as close if not closer than the\npast two - co-writer/co-producer/director Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's\ngrand tale of the quest to destroy the ring to an end.  The story strands\nfollow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with\nan equal worth in entertainment.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor\nunfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and\nPippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn,\nLegolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm\nof the terrors of Sauron.  <br><br>There is much praise that should be given to Jackson and his crew/cast on\nnot just the worth of Return of the King, but to what is now the entire saga\nof the Lord of the Rings as a whole.  Though the film does carry quite a\nload to it (at three hours and twenty-one minutes it's the longest of the\nthree in theatrical form, and it definitely does go on at least ten to\nfifteen minutes longer than it should), and expands and deflates on the\ndetails of some characters (i.e. Saruman is nowhere in sight in this\nversion, while Arwen gets more than what is from the original work), there\nare plenty of rousing scenes and sequences, terrific battles, and a grasp on\nthe visual effects as a whole that don't let up.  In all, ROTK is on the\nlevel with Fellowship and Two Towers, making the parts as good as the whole.\n This is something that only several other filmmakers can make a claim to,\nthat one film does not bring on a let down from the expectations that\npreceded it.  It's the kind of film I'll want to see again, however it would\nbe very difficult to sit through it in one place.  Grade: A (both as a\npicture in and of itself, and overall on the three epics\ncombined)\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's REALLY good. Every single thing about this movie is cool. It's my\nnumber one favourite movie of all time. ( Well actually, the entire\nTRILOGY together is my favourite number one movie of all time. )\nThere's no swearing or nudity. I still don't recommend it for the\nyounger audience because there are some slightly frightening scenes,\nthough. But anybody over eleven shouldn't be bothered. I don't\nrecommend it for arachnophobia, because it might give them a heart\nattack. Anyways, this movie has an excellent beginning and a wonderful\nending. And everything in the middle is great, too. BY ALL MEANS RENT\nIT, but make sure you watch the two first movies first.\n"},
{"review": "\nTruly a masterpiece. This film was more than worthy of its 11 Oscars.\nThe fellowship was stunning, the two towers was inspiring but the\nreturn of the king was truly the greatest film i have ever seen. The\nthing that is most amazing about the return of the king is that it\nfills the jigsaw of its predeceors and does it with such epic granduer\nemotion, and inspiration that i know very few people who were not\namazed by it. I myself have read the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien and\nin light of this can say that this film has to be one of the\nadaptations in recent times. Peter Jackson, I feel simply could not\nhave done a better job in using the beautiful new zealand landscape to\nportray Tolkien's vision.<br><br>Without a doubt the speech, roars and sheer numbers of the rohirrim at\nthe pellennor charge in the sunset is truly the greatest sequence of\nfilm i have ever seen. People say the ending is too long, I say it was\nperfect as it gave a heart felt and fitting deneaumont, and ended a\ntruly remarkable trilogy that will not be soon forgotten.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nFirst, let me say that I did like \"Return of the King.\" It's a special\neffects masterpiece that is destined to become a classic, along with the\nfirst two installments in the \"Lord of the Rings\" saga.<br><br>But, to me, it was far less enjoyable than the first two films, the second\nof which was the best of the three. <br><br>\"King\" was far too long for what it had to say. And the ending (or should I\nsay endings) really disappointed me. I kept waiting for the film to end, but\nit just kept going on and on. There were at least four times that I thought\nthe film was over, but then the next scene would fade in. It would have been\na much better ending if the film had finished with the resolution of the\nfinal battle, and then showed the denouement as a montage next to the\nclosing credits. It would have removed about 20 minutes from the\noverly-lengthy film and would have made the ending less of a \"cut-and-paste\"\nstyle.<br><br>So I'll give it a solid 7. But to me, it has been seriously over-rated by\nboth fans and critics. I'm surprised that more of the critics, at least,\nhaven't picked up on the weak ending.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nHow superb 'The Return of the King' is. It is the ultimate fantasy film\nand\na sure bet for all the film awards this year. Director Peter Jackson has\nachieved the impossible, to make this trilogy and make it so that Tolkien\nfans will be pleased with it in comparison to the book. The special\neffects\nare amazingly good, the actors (Sean Astin who play Samwise Gamgee\nparticularly) are fabulous in their roles and the plot is unflawed,\nrepresenting the book perfectly. There are parts left out but this was\nalways to be expected. Peter Jackson, on first editing the film had a 6\nhour\nlong film that he was happy with. Now, although us Lord of the Rings fans\nmay have been more than happy to sit through that, I don't think others\nwould have been! So inevitably pieces and lines from the book have been\ntaken out. But what we are left with is a film that works perfectly and\nis a\nmasterpiece. Undoubtedly there will be plenty of extra footage on the\nextended DVD and so we'll just have to wait for that to see the film in\nits\nentirety. It's, arguably and in my own opinion, the best of the three\nfilms\nand one that fans and just movie-goers will love. It's got action,\nromance\nand an ending that leaves us satisfied and wanting to see it again and\nagain. Go and see it now!\n"},
{"review": "\nI think that almost everything that can be said about this trilogy has\nbeen said already, but still I will try. There are so many films that\ndestroyed the beauty and perfection of the novels they have been built\nupon, not this one.

Contains an incredible array of\ntechnical visual effects by Weta Digital and Weta Workship among other\nCia. Sensational cinematography by Andrew Lesnie and spectacular and\nsensible musical score by Howard Shore, winning deserved Academy Award.\nBeautifully realized set design with phenomenal production values. The\nfilm provides enough amusement during the three and half hour and stays\ncloser to the novel than any of the former adaptations-mostly animated\nand low budget- such as the mediocre effort by Ralph Baski.

Magnificent direction by Peter Jackson bringing stunningly the\nimaginary world and mythology of Tolkien to life.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nThis movie, the conclusion of Peter Jackson's epic film series based on\nthe\nTolkien novels of the same name, was fairly good on the whole. However,\nhaving read the books beforehand, I was disappointed at several aspects of\nthis movie.<br><br>1. The Pyre of Denethor. This was my favorite scene in the book, but PJ\nmangled it. Instead of having Denethor kneel down on the pyre with his\npalantir, he leaped off of a battlement. This, while hilarious, was\noutrageous also. It was funnier than most parodies, and that's bad. It\nalso\nseemed rushed, whereas in the book, time was taken.<br><br>2. The Wild Men. I don't know why, but this exclusion got my goat. I guess\nI\njust liked the Wild Men, Ghan-Buri-Ghan saying \"Kill gorgun!\" and the fact\nthat they still used a few big words. Maybe I'm just a\npurist.<br><br>3. The Mouth of Sauron. His exclusion irritated me also, and I hear it\nwill\nbe on the EE (Extended Edition), so I guess that's something to look\nforward\nto.<br><br>4. SARUMAN! Why, oh, why cut his scene? Wormtongue as well. Those were two\nof the best characters! 'Nuff said.<br><br>5. Orcs. I was disappointed with the portrayal of the orcs, especially\nShagrat and Gorbag (who are never called by name, along with Grishnakh and\nUgluk from TTT). It seemed as if every orc line was yelled. Can't an orc\nmerely talk? Shagrat and Gorbag were, again, two of the best characters.\nTolkien's orcs were surprisingly sophisticated, and here they are reduced\nto\nyelling, angry simpletons. They even discuss post-war plans in Tolkien.\nTherefore, it was disappointing, except the cockney orc in TTT. \"Why\ncahn't\nwe 'ave some meat?\"<br><br>6. Eowyn and Faramir. The love story is gone, and Eowyn is not as\ndisguised\nas she should be (in the Battle.) Obviously it was filmed but cut, since\nthe\ntwo look at each other at Aragorn's coronation.<br><br>So, it was a good movie with a few flaws.\n"},
{"review": "\nEven after the second installment's grand success, I was still afraid\nthat it will fail. The trailer was brilliant and promised a thousands\nthings to come. And then in the next 3 and a half hours, I was proved\nwrong!<br><br>This was the best conclusion to a great trilogy. I never imagined that\nthey could make it bigger and better than the last two. The previous\nmovies were just picnic. Not only the action sequences but also the\nemotions run high. The battle scenes were really great. But I was more\nconcerned about the people we knew from the last two films who were in\nit. <br><br>You really get that feeling of \"The Return\". Unlike the first two, this\nmovie is stylish. The elements are more elegant, the story more bold,\nthe score more experienced and bold and the dangers more troublesome.\nAs Frodo and Sam march towards Mount Doom, the movie gets more darker\nand hope really seems to fade away. One thing I learned in this movie\nis: Never give up. No matter what happens you have to finish the task\nbecause your cause is important. <br><br>For me and all the LOTR fans, this is not a movie. What we thought of\nas an action movie-of-the-week turned out to be an important lesson on\nhope, friendship, conquering your fears and love. It's a cinematic\nachievement that will never be defeated. This really is the king of all\nmovies and the 11 golden statues prove it.

The film won the Academy Award for\nBest Picture, the only time in history a fantasy film has done so.<br><br>The Return Of The King is the longest of the three films, which suffers\nfrom having to cut between disparate story strands, and - in its final\nhalf-hour - stacks up endings one after the other, like jet planes\nwaiting to land, the director visibly reluctant to let these characters\ngo. Most audiences will forgive Peter Jackson for that, for this is a\nfitting conclusion to a series of films made with tremendous artistry\nand affection for their subject; thrilling spectacle is underscored\nwith palpable human drama, and it finally becomes clear why J.R.R.\nTolkien's books continue to ring such bells so loudly in the lives of\nso many.\n"},

{"review": "\n\nAn adventure movie to match the great ones of the past, and the one to beat\nfor the future. The culmination of this ambitious trilogy is more than\nfitting; it surpasses the first two films by quite a distance. Almost\nnothing disappointed or bothered me. All parts of the story were equally\ninteresting. It was sweeping, it was involving, it was beautiful. One of the\nfew thing I would complain about is the villain. Sauron is boring and more\nor less unseen. He does not feel very threatening. And his army of orcs has\nbeen dull since the first film. They're just not very interesting creatures.\nFortunately, The Return of the King really makes up for these monsters with\na gallery of better ones. Some of them have been present in the other two\nfilms, trolls and those flying dragons that the ring wraiths ride on.\nThey're more present here, however. Even better, though, those gigantic\nelephants, ten times the size of a normal one. Oh, man, those are cool. Star\nWars fans might grumble that they were too much like the AT-AT walkers from\nEmpire, and they are. One scene where Legolas, the elf, triumphs over one of\nthem feels like a sped up version of Luke Skywalker's attack. But the very\nbest thing is a giant spider. Everyone knows that there was originally a\ngiant spider on skull island in King Kong, cut from the film because it\nreally disturbed a test audience. Seeing the spider in Return of the King is\nlike having that famous piece of lost footage restored. When all three films\nare finally out on their special edition DVDs, I'm going to spend a month\ncombing through them to see whether or not the entire series of films isn't\njust as good as this one, or perhaps as good as many of my younger friends\nhave sworn they were.\n"},

It's a\nreal shame we didn't get to see Christopher Lee in this move; he\ntotally rocked in the previous films. Telling us to wait for the\n\"extended\" version isn't right. Maybe Jackson should have foregone one\nof the too many endings in ROTK to give Lee some film time. That said,\nall the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely\nglorious in this film. The one new thing that I would add to so much\nthat has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great\nTolkien artists Alan Lee and John Howe whose artistry shaped so much of\nthe imagery from the first moments of FOTR to the final scenes of ROTK.\nThis historic trilogy would not have been the same without them.

He didn't water down the scene where\nFrodo finally gets to Mt. Doom in order to get rid of The One Ring once\nand for all\u0097in fact it packs quite the punch. The way that scene was\nintermingled with the battle footage heightened the emotional level of\nthe scene as well as the excitement.<br><br>The actors deserve praise as well.

{"review": "\nbefore i saw ROTK in theaters, i had no idea what the big deal was. i\nremembering seeing the first 2 on VHS years ealier and enjoyed them,\nbut never really GOT into it. however, that all changed when i went\nwith my mom to see ROTK in theaters one day......and i was changed. i\ncried! i laughed! i felt moments of terror, i FREAKED when frodo fell\noff the cliff with gollum....only he didn't fall in! it gripped me like\nno other movie has since! and it instantly made me a fan. now i am a\nrings maniac, all due to this film. i will admit, fellowship has since\nbecome my favorite, but i will never forget the experience of ROTK. the\nbattle scenes were gorgeus and epic, and it was just so GREAT! i\nwaitied for an entire YEAR for the extended version on DVD with baited\nbreath! i read all 3 books that summer (and they were actually like the\nfilms were! talk about faithfulness)! the ending made me and my mom cry\nbuckets! stunning, absolutely stunning.\n"},

Everything\nabout this movie is excellent: The special effects, the acting, the\nmusic, the cinematography,... Peter Jackson is an excellent director!\nThis movie is a fantasy film that relies heavily on special effects,\nbut you don't notice anything fake. The special effects have been\nexecuted perfectly! But this movie has more to offer than only special\neffects. The music is very good an contributes a lot to the atmosphere\nof the movie. A beautiful scene is when Pippin sings a song! Also the\nacting is very good! This movie is sometimes very moving. The battle\nscenes are very well done and the movie is very exciting a some\nmoments. The direction by Peter Jackson is amazing, he combines amazing\nspecial effects with very good acting, emotions, suspense and beautiful\ncinematography (the scene at Mount Doom is, in my opinion, one of the\nbest scenes in movie history). I don't think I have to say more about\nthis movie. This movie is exquisite! If you haven't seen it, see it as\nsoon as possible! You will be amazed!\n"},

The acting was astonishing right down to the\nall the bad ugly looking creatures,absolutely amazing special effects\nand Peter Jackson deserves one big round of applause for this filming\nmasterpiece. In this movie Frodo and Sam(Astin and Wood) did amazing\njobs considering to their roles and kept their friendship going and\nmerry and pippin also played their roles amazingly well when they were\nhanded bigger roles in this third and final installment of the\ntrilogy.Bloom,Davies Reprised their roles exceedingly well and there is\nno movie at all without Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen).he did everything\npossible needed of him and he met each and every one of those\nexpectations great job done their. Ian Mckellen also does a very good\njob and there was no movie if it was not for the special effects the\nbattles were astonishing in this movies which makes me want to keep\nwatching the movie over and over again. All said and done this is the\nfinishing touch to an absolute masterpiece and the final block of the\npuzzle to The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.The acting was made to\nperfection and if i was given the chance i will praise this movie over\nand over again together with the previous two movies.

For the\nvery few people left by now who haven't seen this movie, DO SO\nIMMEDIATELY! :] Lord of the Rings is a beautiful work of literature,\nand the movie comes near to matching its brilliance. In the short\ndocumentary entitled \"Ringers, Lord of the Fans,\" someone says that the\npower of Lord of The Rings is almost spiritual, and I agree. Pete\nJackson definitely captured the magic of the books, and you don't want\nto miss it.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Fellowship makes its final path through war and wilderness. The\nstory comes to an 11 academy award winning climax. The movie has a\nstunning power unlike the other two. Peter Jackson uses incredible\ninsight into sstories and themes and character study. The Return of the\nKing culminates its three story lines unimaginably. As the characters\nfinish what is a three year journey you see exactly why Peter Jackson\nmade the fellowship and the two towers because he wanted to arrive at\nthis incredible finale to what is a career trilogy. I enjoyed this film\nfor two main reasons action and intimacy. The action is stunningly\nrealized by weta workshop. But even though the action is great at the\ncenter of it is what is a wonderfully intimate story. As Frodo and Sam\nmake their way to Mount Doom we really get to see them both rise to the\noccasion. We see the real power of friendship as Gollum continues to\ntry to break it. When Aragorn and Gandalf arrive at over 600.000 orcs\nand yet they stand as strong as they were at Helm's Deep. I become more\namazed as the tale goes on we see how difficult and at what price will\neither side win. The feelings of community within us. This is a classic\nand whoever watches will not be disappointed. 10/10\n"},

And I loved the second even better with the Battle of Helm's\nDeep finally winning over my breaking heart with the Two LOTR Movies\nalready\ngnawing at the bottom, I had to say a final farewell to Star Wars 4 &amp; 5\nand\nwelcome The LLord of the Rings. And with this, my heart is fainally\ncomplete. The MArmaluks are unstoppable and Visually Great!!! No words\ncould\ndescribe the intensity of their presence alone. And the Battle of Pelanor\nFields will get you to want to wish you were there yourself, and not as an\norc (Though Trolls are Cool! Though pales in comparisson with the Mass of\nUndead and, of course, the Oliphaunts.) Gollum is once again as great as\never and The rest of the cast are comendable, with great praises going to\nbe\ndue to Gandalf and most especially Sam! The emotional intensity of the\nfilm\nis a full ten! And after you cry from the movie's story, you'll cry about\nwhy oh why wasn't it any longer!!! And indeed, we must now bid a final\nfarewell to our dearest, The Lord of The Rings Trilogy, the only Trilogy\nto\nhave a complete set of Movies with no equals but each other.

For those fans who have only\njust begun to discover Middle  Earth through the films, Tolkien's\nmasterpiece 3-part epic remains intact in its message,  imagery, and\ntimeless virtue.  Here preserved on 35mm film for all to see is the capstone\nto the epic film series that has become an international phenomenon with\ncritics, fans,  and especially the box office.<br><br> The Return of the King is the big payoff.  In a sense the film is just\nthat, the third chapter  to a massive 11+ hour epic film, and certainly the\nmost rewarding film of the series.  But  for being packed with exhilirating\naction, nail-biting suspense, intense dramatic scenes  and heartfelt\nemotional scenes that will make grown men cry - The Return of the King\ntells the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings with surprising patience\nand a very  carefully wrought edge to storytelling.  Here the many strands\nof the story are skillfuly  interwoven throughout the film and eventually\nbrought together in a very momentous  climax which will literally make you\nwant to rise up from your seat and start roaring  battle cries along with\nthe bedraggled warriors on the screen who, in the face of  unstoppable\nhatred, rally together and charge forward nonetheless.<br><br> You will love this movie.  If you have missed seeing the other films then\ngo and watch  them to prep yourself for seeing this one.  You simply cannot\nmiss this while it is in the  theaters, it will knock you down and you will\nlove every minute of it.<br><br> 10/10\n"},

He really grows\nthroughout\nthe movies and fully matures in the last instalment of the\nTrilogy.<br><br>All in All, For RotK: Ten thumbs up. I loved it.\n(Cant Wait for SE)\nAs for the Series: About Bloody Time!! :-)\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI just got back from taking part in Trilogy Tuesday (16 hours at the movie\ntheater) and just want to say Return of the King didn't let me down. Once\nagain the fight scenes are good, there's some good humor, and of course\ngreat acting. The end has some scenes that might make you teary-eyed so\nbring some tissues! Too tired to write more... I just wanted to be the\nfirst!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI thought the first two films were great and then I saw Return of the\nKing...  somehow this made the first two even better while at the same time\nmaking them pale by comparison.  This movie is beautiful, breathtaking,\nexciting, thrilling, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring, heart-pounding, and\nhumbling.  The movie stands for itself and words are not fit to descrribe\nit.  This is the film by which all others should be judged!\n"},
{"review": "\n\nHow could anyone put into words a description of this movie? It may sound\nsad but it touched me so much I was in tears for an hour after I saw it.\nIt\nwas the most touching, heartfelt, spectacular, story I have ever seen in\nthe\nCinema that I don't think even the words I used just now do it justice...\nAll I have to say is it is DEFINITELY the best for last, the special\neffects\nand stunt work was beyond this world and just the way everything flowed\nand\nhow true the characters were was just magical to watch! If I had to\nrecommend this, I would say GO AND SEE IT MORE THAN 5 TIMES!!! YOU WILL\nLOVE\nIT!\n"}
