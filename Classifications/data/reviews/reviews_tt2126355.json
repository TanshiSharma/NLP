He's kinda\ngood in this, I like him, even when he's part of this manipulative\npropaganda. The special effects were nice. it kinda flowed, sort of, I\nguess, lots of plot holes but why bother looking for them when the iq\nlevel they're aiming this at is so low you're not supposed to notice.\nThe cheesy flag at the end gives you another good piece of cheese to\nchoke on.

The last good disaster movie I saw was\nThe Towering Inferno, and you know that was a long, long time ago. It's\nstill my favorite disaster flick. San Andreas, of course, had much\nbetter special effects. (several decades later, better effects, right?)\nI thought the scenes of the destruction were amazing. <br><br>We all know disaster movies usually focus on a handful of people in it\nand this one was no different. The movie was entertaining for me. I\nhope it is for you, too. :)\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was so bad that it actually made me angry. I didn't think it\nwas possible to make a more ridiculously stupid disaster movie than\n2012. I was wrong. I will just nit-pick the opening scene real fast\nsince IMDb reviews require 10 lines of text. So a car is hanging on the\nside of a mountain by a tree branch. It shifts and slides down three\ndifferent times for dramatic effect... Stupid. Why would the LAFD take\na reporter and her camera man on a dangerous rescue mission??? Stupid.\nThe reporter asks one of the rescuers, \"What is the biggest difference\nfrom rescuing people here in LA, rather than in the Middle East?\" The\nguy says, \"Well, we aren't getting shot at over here.\" She proceeds to\nwrite in her notebook \"CUTE NOT BRIGHT\", referring to the ex-soldier\nwho answered her question. What did she think the biggest difference\nwould be? He gave a very valid answer to her idiotic question. This\nmovie is terrible and completely predictable.\n"},
{"review": "\nI had been waiting to see this with much anticipation and what a\ncomplete let down. I can honestly say I have not seen such an awful\nfilm for a long time. After watching San Andres Fault by mistake I was\nso hopeful that nothing could be quite as bad as that. I was wrong. I\nknow it's a big blockbuster and made to leave the viewer in awe, but I\njust laughed at it. My partner and I sat and said what was going to\nhappen next and it did. The plot was dire from the start and I was kind\nof hoping the film would end before it had even got half way through\nit. Why do they always have Brits in American films who sound like they\nare so posh? Totally not called for. The acting was OK and I like\nDwayne Johnson, but this was beneath him. The most ridiculous film in\nyears.\n"},
{"review": "\nGoing into this film I knew it wasn't going to be one of the best films\nI've ever seen I just knew I would like the visual effects and the\naction, although there were some parts that wouldn't have happened in\nreal life but that's standard Hollywood, it's expected. The story line\nand plot wasn't anything spectacular. It wasn't anything you haven't\nseen before, very clich\u00e9d and predictable. The Rock's performance in\nthis film did give it that extra kick that was needed to make this film\na bit more tolerable. If you're planning on seeing this film enjoy the\nride for the visual effects and the action, don't expect very much\nmore. I'm not going to say it's bad and I'm not going to say it's good.\nIt's just a clich\u00e9d Hollywood work of art. You be the judge.\n"},

There's an excellent cast as well,\nled by Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino with good support form Alexandra\nDaddario, Paul Giamatti, and Hugo Johnstone-Burt. However, I hope\nyou're not expecting any earth shattering (no pun intended) dialogue or\nstoryline, because the filmmakers here have taken every plot clich\u00e9 and\nhokey line of dialogue and thrown it into this movie.<br><br>All in all, this film, directed by Brad Peyton, with a screenplay from\nCarlton Cuse, is just an escape filled with one tension packed scene\nafter another, but don't be surprised if you find yourself\nunintentionally laughing out loud with some of the cheesy dialogue and\nplot elements.\n"},
{"review": "\nCan I give it zero? I have said this for years about disaster films:\nthey all have the same plot line. Somewhere at the beginning there will\nbe a failed relationship, one that usually has a child or two involved\nas well. From there (not saying it happens here), the ex- couple will\nstruggle to save their child, with usually the man becoming the hero of\nthe day, so that Mom and Dad will be together again with their\nchild/ren. <br><br>This was such a horrible, horrible movie!!! Reminds me of when 3D\nmovies came out in the early 80's - bad movies where they tried to\nthrow everything and anything at the screen, but lacked a story. Since\nCGI effects came on the scene, it seems many bad movies, like this one,\nthink they can overcome a badly written movie by making some awesome\neffects. It will work for most of the do-do's out there, but otherwise\nwill fall flat for most. <br><br>I should add, that \"hey! I ain't looking for something too deep, but\nfor God's sake, use your imagination a bit folks...folks being the ones\nwho are writing this garbage!<br><br>Extremely shameful!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nAt least in that film you cared a little about the characters, and\nbelieve it or not, most of the \"special effects\" worked better. As did\nthe realistic challenges of facing a disaster of that magnitude. The\nCGI destruction on LA in \"San Andreas\" is nearly indistinguishable from\nwhat we saw in \"2012\". And the close up scenes just don't work as the\ncamera is too focused on the actors faces and Dwayne Johnson's biceps\nrather than the action we paid to see in the first place. Like most\nfilms that rely too much on CGI, the destruction just isn't believable,\nand happens too fast in several scenes for you to understand what\nyou're looking at. However I have to admit that finally seeing San\nFrancisco take it up the Richter Scale scored high with me.\n"},

Yes... that\nis his job however if that was your job and your daughter was in\nhorrible danger you would probably do the same thing! It's human nature\nto protect your children and the ones you love first. and once in San\nFrancisco he did help others.<br><br>Although I did find the acting a bit wooden and the near death scenes\ntotally unbelievable ( who the heck falls 6 stories and still survives\nwith only minor scrapes and bruises I dunno) I liked the storyline\nthough and the visual effects were awesome!

Within 15 minutes I told my other half that , the\nparents about to get a divorce would not, the daughter missing after a\nmassive earthquake would be found, the new partner of the mother would\nbe killed and everyone would live happily ever after.

Every Time a person was in\ntrouble right after they got saved the building they were in\ntoppled,who would have thought.

{"review": "\nJust watched this on a 65 inch TV and I imagine on the big screen that\nthe CGI would be even more inspiring. Most films that depend this much\non green screens tend to have dark backgrounds for sets; not this one\nas everything is shot in bright daylight. So I give credit to those\ninvolved in all of that computer work. But the dialogue writer and\nacting coaches should be hiding in shame. Most films of this genre call\nfor a willing suspension of belief but this one calls for a \"What the H\nE double hockey-sticks f'ing unbelievable surrender.\" Once you accept\nthat premise and just settle back to watch the Hoover Dam and San\nFrancisco tumble down as our hero does the impossible, then you can\njust enjoy the architectural carnage.

Seriously?\nThe love story between Ben and Blake is terrible to watch, or is that\nbecause of the horrible accent of the little brother? <br><br>All by all,predictable and unbelievable from start to finish.

{"review": "\nSan Andreas is an educational film and not an entertainment in the\ncinematic sense. There is no entertainment in watching large numbers of\npeople getting squished by falling buildings or drowned by an enormous\ntsunami. There are two central characters. The action man is Fire and\nRescue helicopter pilot Dwayne Johnson. The brainy character is Paul\nGiamatti's college Professor. Dwayne Johnson's character Raymond Gaines\ngets to fly a helicopter, a light aircraft, a powerboat and a road\nvehicle. Paul Giamatti's character Dr Lawrence Hayes is the scientist\nwho, along with Dr Kim Park, gets to find out how to predict an\nearthquake in advance so that he can warn people to try and get out of\nharm's way in time. Although the West Coast gets flattened by the\nbiggest earthquake in history the film itself ends on a positive note\nwith a large Stars and Stripes flag being unfurled from what is left of\nGolden Gate Bridge.\n"},

Okay, the story is about an\nearthquake, so you have a little bit of a drama too, but don't worry\nabout it, Dwayne's Johnson muscles -for the ladies- and Alexandra's\nDaddario eyes -for the boys- should do the trick.\n"},

{"review": "\nIt's CGI destruction time as Dwayne Johnson battles earthquakes and a\ntsunami to go rescue his daughter - with estranged wife in tow of\ncourse.<br><br>Disaster films are easy to kick because very rarely they are nothing\nmore than candy carnage with a trite screenplay and cheese laden\ndialogue. Such is the case with San Andreas. In essence this is a\nremake of Roland Emmerich's 2012, only this is the shorter version with\nthe time span that 2012 should have had. This does exactly what the\nmarketing department promised it would, namely lots of crash bang and\nwallop, but just like Emmerich's behemoth it gets boring entering the\nfinal third, the writing just not good enough to hold interest once the\nnoise and destruction dies down before the big finale arrives. Suspense\nis absent, emotional investment in characters is null and void, while\nthere are no worthwhile surprises in store. But on the plus side\nJohnson is a likable guy and he carries us through till the end of what\nis a fun movie if expectation levels are appropriately set at dumb\npopcorn fodder. 6/10\n"},
{"review": "\nTo tell the truth, I didn't expect much from this disaster of a movie.\nNot wanting to waste $5, I waited for the film to come out for rental\non Blu-Ray. The technical mistakes have been cited by others and I will\nnot reiterate them. The acting, what little there is, was not\nsurprising giving the cast and subject matter. I make exception for\nPaul Giamatti. The majority of the credits for the film go to the\nspecial effects people, as unbelievable as they are. Two outstanding\npoints in this film belong to Alexandra Daddario; and her eyes are not\nbad either. Hence my rating of 2 rather than 1. God, I'm sure glad I\ndidn't waste two hours in a theater watching this tragedy of a\ndisaster. It is certainly too bad it grossed roughly five times more\nthan its budget. That will only encourage more of the same ilk.\n"},
{"review": "\nThrilling film!Having watched the film it had a sense of family life\nwhich made it that more engaging and thrilling...but to be honest it\nwas a bit too predictable towards the end. <br><br>The whole film together was an insight to the struggle of natural\ndisasters which made it that much more sympathetic. Was a great watch,\nI would recommend it to friends.<br><br>It is the type of film that restores my faith in humanity. Not one\nperson was selfish enough to just save themselves, but it was nice to\nsee people work together to fight for survival in the circumstances\nthat faced them.\n"},

{"review": "\nThis is the very definition of mindless summer escapism. It's like a\nroller coaster on film. It promises a wild ride that excites the\naudience without any intellectual effort and it delivers on its\npromise. Many have complained that the script isn't very intelligent.\nThey're right. Every character is just a prop with an invisible label,\nevery actor in it has nothing to do but act out their characters'\nclich\u00e9s, every disaster movie clich\u00e9 is recycled, and every major scene\nwill surprise no one who has seen a disaster movie before. When the end\ncomes for so many millions, no one stops to mourn, they just rush to\nthe next scene with no thought. It was brainless and obvious, but so\nwhat? I was on the my seat anyway. Films like \"The Poseidon Adventure,\"\n\"Independence Day,\" and especially \"Earthquake\" have done the same\nthing, deliver mayhem and near-death experiences with style and\nexpertise.

{"review": "\nThis is a classic of disaster movies: a plot that makes no sense,\ncharacters that seem to exist in a bubble of their own and ridiculous\njustifications for plot advancements BUT destruction on a scale unseen\nso far, absolutely incredible special effects and disastrous (in the\ngood way in that case) quakes &amp; tsunamis. In that sense, no surprise.\nYet, somehow, one would have hoped that this movie would break the mold\nand make sense. But we have to compose with a grand total of 10?\ncharacters; a \"hero\" that goes from LA to San Francisco in a\nhelicopter, a plane, a car and then a boat to rescue his ex wife and\nhis daughter. Let's just woefully ignore that this would have caused\nthe death of 30 million people at least and cheer. Average score\nbecause it met the expectation and was good looking in its disaster.\n"},

{"review": "\nwell, certainly you gonna enjoy the 2 hours of watching, it is a very\ngood movie overall, the top winner here is the great visual effects,\nstunning, maybe in some parts you feel like they were done in a hurry,\nbut of course we all know what is done when one is behind schedule, the\nmovie is running in a fast pace so you need to keep your breath\nfollowing it. The storyline is somehow repeated and there are some\nflaws in it. The script has nothing special except may be one quote \"If\nyou couldn't save her, then nobody could have.\" well, I liked it\nmyself, what u think? acting from all characters is good but no way to\neven dream about an Oscar there is nothing special about any of them,\nthe human side and survival instinct could have been better used, these\nare the main lines I need to talk about, but again a very good movie,\nand I enjoyed it and certainly recommend it\n"},
{"review": "\nI had huge expectation from this movie , was expecting some outstanding\n3d effects and story.. Ater watching movie it was more about Mr. ROCK\nsaving his family not others... so why name the movie as San Andreas\n???

Still Good one time\nwatch and specially kids enjoyed it a lot... so I give 6. I would\nrecommend this too. Go for it if you want to enjoy showing your kids\nall woo effects and teach some lesson on science. Don't expect any\nstory or script.\n"},
{"review": "\nSan Andreas is directed by Brad Petyon, starring Dwayne\"the rock\"\nJohnson, Carla Gugino, and Alexandra Daddario. It's about Ray(the\nRock), he's a rescue copper pilot and when an huge earthquake hits\nCalifornia, you will see Ray and his family trying to survive this\ndisaster. First off this movie shows that the rock can carry his own\nmovie and be great In it. The bad thing is that the rock is one of the\nfew good things about San Andreas. The visuals are good but at some\ntimes you can see bad CGI. Some of scenes are breathtaking and need to\nbe seen on a big screen. The acting is good by everyone. If the rock\nwasn't the star of the movie, it wouldn't be a good movie at all.The\nRock is just a likable star. Overall San Andreas was a good disaster\nmovie,with a good performance by the rock and great disaster scenes.\nYou don't need to rush to the theater to see this but it also wouldn't\nbe a waste of your money.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm not like this movie at all, I think it presented on a way too much\nand make me said \"such a fool\". first thing in my mind when earthquake\nhappen people should run to the nearest meeting point not run into the\ntop of a building. and everyone is panic i don't know how a person fall\ndown from a table like a drunk person, how a chef burn or people just\nscared and stay on their place not running away. a rescue person using\nan instance helicopter like that is his personal helicopter to save his\nown family not public that he should to save them all. and where the\nother rescue people?

{"review": "\nWhile Sharknado was meant to be good fun San Andreas was meant to be\nall serious. The quality of the stories are the same but where\nSharknado was meant to be fun San Andreas is just plain ridiculous and\nstupid.

Yes,\nthe destruction of the city looks good but when they mix in scenes so\nunrealistic and stupidly heroish it all falls apart. I guess they\nintended to add at least some realism to the movie but there is not a\nscene in the movie that even comes close to being realistic.<br><br>OMG!

{"review": "\nThis is not a movie which leaves your wondering, I can sum up the\nmovie.

He failed, i\nusually love his movies but in this one nothing works. Its just a mess\nwith poor writing and poor acting. The only good acting comes from Ioan\nGruffudd who is hardly in the movie....

This is a movie for teenagers, young teenagers at\nthat, and certainly not for anyone looking to immerse themselves in\nanything close to realism. The acting was fine, the special effects\nwere pretty good, and the suspense factor was high, but the story was\nAWFUL!<br><br>If I did not know better, I would say this movie was made in a rush, as\nthough someone at the top was about to drop it, so the producers hacked\nit together as quickly as possible.

It is a good family\nfilm that serves up the action and special effects but keeps it\ngrounded, albeit cheesy at times. Sure, the two English brothers who\nsaved his daughter at first then she saves them is pretty schmaltzy but\nnot too terrible. Add the cad of a potential step father who wimps out\nto save himself, in order to set up a possible re-union between the\nRock and his ex, played by Carla Gugino, borderline cheese too.<br><br>The Rock is so much a better action hero he-man type than his 80s\npredecessors like Stallone and Lundgren it isn't worth the comparison.\nNot that he is a great actor, but he has much better screen presence.<br><br>In all, it is a good enjoyable disaster movie and an easy watch, and\nsafe for the kids too\n"},
{"review": "\nI am normally satisfied by most reviews about movies I enjoyed.\nSometimes I disagree with a review and feel like commenting. San\nAndreas is a movie that is underrated, I think because it is\nunpretentious and kind of heroic.

The\nspecial effects were so realistic they were unbelievable. My wife and I\nwere literally transfixed watching this movie.
