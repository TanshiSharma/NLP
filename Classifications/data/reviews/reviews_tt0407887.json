{"review": "\nNow I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie\n'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings\nit to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we\nwalked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic\nthe environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the\nlead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly\nentertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's\nperspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg,\nSheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The\nBig Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but\nthey make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene\nthey are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with\nthe basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find\nyourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back\nand forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese\nfan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly\nsee the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course\nthe music, it's great to hear \"Gimme Shelter\" again, but \"Comfortably\nNumb\" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet\nthis one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree\nScorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar\nworthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since\n'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I\nseeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with\nthe politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had\nsat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining\nstorytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese.\n"},
{"review": "\nPlease don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned\npeople have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen\nit, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the\nyear so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks\nwith the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of\nfilms.<br><br>I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is\nbased. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it\nis very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William\nMonahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its\nscreenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and\nScorsese's, respective visions.<br><br>All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio\nbashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to\ndate. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins,\nincluding (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best\nDirector. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing\nsupporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they\nsigned up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart.\nThat said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent,\ngritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.\n"},
{"review": "\nExcellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special\nscreening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is\nnot really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of\nthe city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put\non the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than\nsupportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were\nable to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the\ntime. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has\nreally come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a\nnumber of original performances all of which have expanded his range.\nHe really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created\nsomething that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of\nmy favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for\neach other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any\nother city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not\nreally) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and\nshoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was\nextensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised\noutside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point,\nwould find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's\ndirection, I think he scored big with this one. While many have\ncriticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that\nhe has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my\nfavorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things\nin his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his\nbest effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created\nsomething truly special from a city that is highly underrated.\n"},

Witness\nthe affair storyline, which is an unnecessary sop to the need for a\nmore prominent female role, or the FBI addition, which is completely\nsuperfluous.<br><br>The end result is simply a lot weaker than the tightly-budgeted,\ntightly-edited, subtler original.<br><br>The only improvement \u0096 and I shudder to say this \u0096 is Alec Baldwin's\nrole as the wise-cracking police captain, which made me chuckle on many\noccasions.<br><br>Get the original out instead.

{"review": "\nBefore seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a\nScorsese movie, but The Departed was even better than I expected.<br><br>The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite\npossibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate\nhim admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my\nbrother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack\nNicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley\nand As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the\nbest lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.<br><br>Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the\nbest remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful,\nsuperbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most\nshocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's\ntwo and a half hour running time. <br><br>The film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and\nadapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them.\nDiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations.<br><br>See this as soon as you can.\n"},
{"review": "\nOh my God.<br><br>I can say without overstatement that I just saw the most gripping and\nentertaining American film to come out in at least the past ten years.<br><br>I was lucky enough to get a pass to an advance screening of The\nDeparted this past weekend in Boston. I wasn't sure what to expect and\nactually planned on being a little disappointed with all the\nexpectations and hype of such an all-star cast.<br><br>From the moment the opening credits came up, the movie grabbed me by\nthe neck, ripped me out of my seat and didn't let go until the final\nscene.<br><br>Each performance is more masterful than the next. Damon was a tour de\nforce as the lead, tapping every ounce of his acting reservoir for this\nrole. Nicholson creates another classic role to add to his already\nsterling resume. His mob boss would almost steal every scene he was in,\nif it not for every other actor being so fantastic However, the biggest\nsurprise for me personally came from Leonardo DeCaprio.<br><br>Having never warmed up to any of his roles or movies, I found myself\nblown away by him in this. I'm not sure if it was the material he was\ngiven, or if DeCaprio has grown this much as an actor, or a combination\nof both, but he finally won me over with his role in this instant\nScorsese classic. Every character is pitch perfect, every scene is\nright on the money. The plot builds to a crescendo of such dynamic\nproportions rarely seen on film. I don't want to give too much away,\nbut I'm still shaken from the ride I was taken on.<br><br>People go to the movies in the hopes that maybe once in a hundred times\nyou get to experience storytelling so masterful and transcendent that\nit changes the way you view cinema. This is one of those spectacularly\nperfect times.<br><br>Forget Taxi Driver. Forget Raging Bull. Forget Goodfellas. As much as I\nLOVE those movies and as much as they have affected me in my lifetime,\nThe Departed will hands down be Martin Scorsese's Master Work.\n"},
{"review": "\nThey sure know how to make their version real 'American' with all the F\nwords. That seriously was annoying, how every actor in the movie always\nneeded to curse, I should have counted them.<br><br>The original (Infernal Affairs/Mou gaan dou) is way better.<br><br>Why? Cause the most important key was missing! In the original movie;\nthe mole (Chan Wing Yan (as Tony Leung)) in the mafia gang had a great\nbond with the head guy of the entire case. He gave him a watch for his\nbirthday. At that moment you could see how those two has a bond with\neach other. That would explain the grief that he showed in the movie\nwhen the head guy got killed.<br><br>The American re-film: Billy and Queenan totally had NO connection in my\neyes. All Dignam could do was bash him with the f words. Why the hell\nwould Billy give a crap that Queenan died? They had no bond. <br><br>I think supposedly in both movies the death of the head guy was the\ntwist in the cases.

That all cause of the death of that\nhead guy.<br><br>So yeah, I advice everybody to watch the original one first. I think\nthis movie is too overrated.

{"review": "\nDo you know the story about the king who left his palace naked and\neveryone in the crowd watching him were commenting on his splendid\nclothes?

Because that is what\nScorcese's film is-it is naked, devoid of any rhyme or reason, of any\nreason why things happen, of any values. To me it is just the ranting\nof an older man, it is Scorcese fantasizing about violence, sex,\ncorruption ; it is Scorsese thinking \"wow it is so clever to show all\nthis blood and to have my actors swear all the time, yeah this is art\"\n. Well, I am sorry, but this isn't art. This is about Scorsese\nrepeating himself and indulging in his obsessions and us congratulating\nhim. I am not a conservative person- I just feel like the little boy in\nthe story who cried out that the king was naked; like the little boy\nwho wasn't a hypocrite and just showed things as they were.\n"},

Dream-boats Damon and DiCaprio do a good job vanishing into their\nroles as tough guys, but their charm and ruthlessness still can't mask\nthe crime-thriller clich\u00e9s; and the ultra-climatic conclusion is just\nreally nothing more than simply over-the-top. The wittiness of Jack\nNicholson doesn't impress since he doesn't seem to do much acting, but\nrather just charismatically act like Jack. The quirky dialogue of\nIrish-American mobsters comes off as corny and tiring. Martin Sheen and\nMark Wahlberg are memorable and well-delivered in the humorous\ngood-cop-bad-cop odd-couple, with the latter earning a Best Supporting\nActor nomination.

For those unfamiliar with Siu Fai Mak, I deeply\nencourage you to watch 'Mou Gaan Dou' (\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/ ) aka 'Infernal Affairs' - the\nbasis for this film. Infernal Affairs contains far more intense drama\nand (if not better) an equally high quality acting roster than this\nremake.

Infernal Affairs also used more intelligent ways of\ncommunication between the undercover and the source, making you sit at\nthe edge of your seat. Aside from much stronger story lines, it also\nportrayed mental health workers in a much more professional\nmanner...the psychiatrist in the Departed would've had her license\ntaken away in a snap as there are strict laws prohibiting dual\nrelationships. Just like all meaningless mainstream movies, as if\nputting in a sex scene and showing some flesh would make up for the\nhorrid chopped up story. The original made the psychiatrist-patient\nrelationship more real and tapped into the inner workings of the\npsychiatrist working with an undercover. If you are looking for a truly\nwell written screenplay with deep emotional plots, go watch the\noriginal Infernal Affairs instead!\n"},

What happened? You\nsee DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson and all the other stars and you have a\nmasterpiece? That's not what I thought cinema was. I've seen both\nversions, in fact I have it on DVD. The Departed is a great movie,\nthat's true. But it's nothing more. I can't understand why Martin\nchanged so many things and he still thought it would be the same story\nbut told in a different words. This is not about Italian Mafia!!! This\nis about Chinese mafia, and that's not the same!!! Please, everyone who\nenjoyed The Departed: Take a look on Infernal Affairs. Or ask Tarantino\nabout what he thinks about this remake... The film is OK, but there's\nno color between The Departed and IA. Salud!\n"},

{"review": "\nThe Departed, the winner of the academy award for best motion picture,\nis just another remake based on a Chinese original. Critics called it\none of the best movies of the year 2006, but in my opinion it is a\ndisgrace to the Chinese original, called The Infernal Affairs. And it\nis also Scorsese's worst film ever. Even Gangs of New York were more\noriginal than this film. Let me explain why I didn't like this film.<br><br>First, the characters are empty. There is no emotion and the characters\ndon't develop throughout the film. They are just like chess figures on\na board.<br><br>If I go on, this is two and a half hour long remake of a trilogy of at\nleast six hours in length, so many important things were left out, so\nthe story is full of holes that really need to be patched.<br><br>As it is typical for Hollywood the body-count must always be bigger.\nMany characters just die for no reason at all. It seems like Scorsese\nthinks that if he delivers us a messy massacre the film will be a\nsuccess. Just return to your basics Scorsese. Your older films are much\nbetter than your recent crap that you call a movie.<br><br>Another big mistake is that Nicholson's character is more developed\nthan the characters of Damon and DiCaprio, maybe because Nicholson\nreally did a good job and acted as a professional. But this is the only\nbright point of the film. And this is the reason for my two stars,\nbecause Nicholson is the only one who keeps this movie above one star.\nA disaster in every way and a very unfair decision of the Academy to\nclaim this movie as the best motion picture, especially to the Infernal\nAffairs, which deserves an Oscar for the best motion picture more than\nthis poor interpretation.\n"},

The music\nwas excellent and Tony Leung's performance was spellbinding, but the\nmovie was hard to follow.<br><br>I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was\non my mind as I watched The Departed, which is a remake of that film.

Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent. I\nhave never been a big fan of Leonardo. I really liked him in Gangs of\nNew York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the\ntop. Having said that, I can't really think of another character's\nperformance in The Departed that is worth mentioning. It ran 50 minutes\nlonger than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it\ndid not add anything to the film. The setup in the beginning was really\na bore. Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and\nGoodfellas, one of my favorite films. I really don't see him winning an\nOscar for this film, though they will probably give it to him for\nignoring his earlier and better work.\n"},

{"review": "\nThe Departed is an occasionally engaging film, beautifully acted and\nphotographed. It has powerful narrative energy as it breathlessly races\nthe viewer through a complex plot. However, the praise for this film\nhas been far overblown. The Departed is not as inventive as Taxi Driver\nand not startling and sublime like Raging Bull. In fact, Scorcese's new\nfilm is overly long and somewhat tedious. The contrived plot seems\nbanal, and neither Di Caprio nor the bland Damon make their roles\nparticularly interesting. Sadly, despite his technical virtuosity, it\nbecomes apparent here that Scorcese has little more to say about his\nthemes of urban alienation and the brutality of modern life. The film\nis grotesquely violent at times, and the viewer begins to wonder as yet\nanother bloody shooting \"goes down.\" Unfortunately, the shallowness of\nthis film and its predictable brain-spraying violence disappoint the\nScorcese fan.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'd have seen this film regardless of the reviews. Scorcese has\ndirected some of the most significant, dramatic and best-told stories\nof our time, and with Nicholson, Damon, DeCaprio, Baldwin, Sheen,\nWalberg and the rest, it at least had a solid chance to be a tour de\nforce. It's a mess, though, dragged down to lousy by a screenplay\nwritten by the same misguided pen of that disaster-bore-embarrassment\n\"Kingdom Of Heaven\". Bad or no structure can't be saved by\nover-cranking the ragefest volume.<br><br>It's hard to say why Marty needs to wallow in even deeper pools of\nperpetual manic violence and blood at this point in his career. Maybe\nhe still just likes it. Maybe he's feeling like we need to take some\npeople out. Maybe the only way he could punctuate and hold together\nthis cluster was with regular, loud, brain blasting, because if it\nweren't for the continuous bang-bang-blast, in-your-face-insults and\nface-punch scenes the story would've resembled a garbage pile. An\ninteresting plot line was strung together by an amateur, though\nfortunately you've got watchable actors, some wry funny lines and a few\noutrage scenes that pop.<br><br>The screenplay's choppy, the edits and lighting choices are weird, and\nthe script's incongruent in a bad way. It never builds a tempo. That's\nScorcese's fault. It was a great shame to see great actors content with\naccepting performance mania in lieu of characters. So in spite of all\nthe odd-crazy, there're also huge bald spots. Nobody in this film goes\nbeyond one-dimensionally anger-crazed, with the possible exception of\nDeCaprio. Still, I couldn't understand how Leo didn't explode during\nthis film; he goes from appearing over-stressed and over-drugged to\nrage-psycho.

It's\nnot that they curse it's that they ONLY do that, as if a tirade\nWahlberg-style could actually replace acting and real emotions. It\nseems like throwing in a dick-joke, adding some punches, yelling, being\nall f**k this and f**k that is what makes true 'realism'. Even in minor\nscenes; in IA the mob-mole merely has a conversation with the\npsychologist; here he blows up, yells and runs away. After the cinema\nscene, when the cop nearly finds out who the mole is in IA you have a\ntense psychological scene; in The Departed Matt Damon MUST stab\nsomebody, apparently the director doesn't think it's cool enough\nwithout that. Or the classic rooftop end scene- in IA the two opponents\nact calmly, with dignity- here there's cursing and fighting and\npunching instead of a shared moment of drama.
