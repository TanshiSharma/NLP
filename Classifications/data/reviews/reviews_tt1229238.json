{"review": "\nI'm not a fan of Tom Cruise as a person and that sometimes influences\nmy opinion on a film. Even with this point in the back of my mind I\nmust say that Tom Cruise still got it. He's a fantastic actor who\ndoesn't even chose to have a stunt double in MI4. I couldn't even think\nof trying some of these. Now to the main film. You may think it's going\nto be just like all the other action movies and all the other Mission:\nImpossible parts. But with every new part of the series it gets even\nmore spectacular: the equipment is beyond imagination, the locations\nare mind blowing, the secret plans are super clever, the characters are\ncool and smart. Also the trailer was that good that I just wanted to\nsee this at the movies and couldn't wait for it to be released. I\nhaven't seen any MI film at the movies and this was definitely a great\ndecision. The best action film in years.<br><br>I'm giving it a 10/10 because there was nothing I didn't like about\nthis movie and it was worth every cent!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis was a fun movie to watch; much better than I anticipated. Usually\nsequels have totally run their course by the fourth time, but not so\nhere. In fact, this might even be the best of the Mission Impossible\nfilms.<br><br>It has a good mixture of interesting action scenes, suspense, drama,\nhumor, great scenery of Venice, Italy, and fine acting. Nothing is\noverdone to the point of being too much and, as most MI films go, it\nhas the normal espionage-type intrigue to figure out.<br><br>It's just plain entertaining. Kudos to all: the director, the actors\nand the special-effects and cameraman. A superb job done all around.\n"},
{"review": "\nIn the way of movies - MI4 Ghost Protocol is another in a long line of\nlet's fill up the screen with as much crap as we can . Busy does not\nmean good - it's boring. The same jump off a rooftop, car chases,\ncrashes , fights , etc etc etc. MI4 tries so hard to take itself\nseriously but instead ends up one long car chase so to speak. Tom\nCruise does his usual look at me I'm trying to be cool act which is\nabout the same thing he does in every one of his movies. His team of\nagents also does the we look cool so watch us do these cool things .\nThe plot if there is one about the Kremlin being blown up is boring - I\nfell asleep halfway through and wanted to just go home. The backers of\nthis series are beating a dead horse trying to milk whatever else they\ncan get out of it no matter how bad the script is or how long in the\ntooth Cruise gets . Sad thing is ,this movie will make money because\nCruise's name is attached to it. Too many fanboys out there who don't\ncare if a movie sucks as long as their boy or girl is in it will plunk\ndown the bucks to see it over and over. 1/10 -Bomb\n"},
{"review": "\nWell... Where do we start...? The biggest thing I'd like to know, is\nwhose idea was it to make the Mission Impossible franchise into a cheap\nslapstick comedy?<br><br>Cruise does not seem to sit well with the role of Ethan Hunt this time,\nin this format. He just never looks comfortable with the amateur comedy\nroutines with his fellow cast-mates. It's just a bad, cheesy film. It\nlacks sophistication; no charisma; the action is B-movie-ish from start\nto end and style makes all the gadgets seem rather pathetic. There's\njust no depth to it at all.<br><br>After the smooth style of the third instalment, this one drops the\nbaton spectacularly. It feels dis-jointed and never finds a flow which\ncould pull it all together. Even the music doesn't seem to work. You're\njust left not caring whether this new band of jokers fail/succeed, live\nor die.<br><br>Very poor attempt.\n"},

Thats right, we\nlike this movies for this moments. But in the first 3 movie this was\nOK. In Ghost Protocol we have a big mistake.<br><br>In the first minutes of the film we know the terrorists have the\nnuclear launch codes. Everybody know in the IMF. HEY??? Why don't they\ncall the Russian president, and say: Hey mr president, change the\nlaunch codes, because stolen the originals... bing bang bung end of\nstory, the crisis is over, the stolen codes are useless and everybody\nhappy...<br><br>But don't. they risk global nuclear war, send some men to death,\ninstead of a call for the president.<br><br>Phatetic.\n"},
{"review": "\nGlamor, unbelievably expensive cars and special effects are all stars\nof the movie, if any. The story is enough entertaining for the video\ngame if you are below 6 years of age. The plot sadly exists but is so\nbanal and shallow that it might fit in one sentence: kill the\nterrorist, save the world and prove that Americans rule and are\nalmighty! And they so much are since walking into Kremlin is a peace of\ncake, gathering data there is easier than getting a hot dog on the\nlocal kiosk while people from time to time are becoming cats and\nwalking on the outside wall of the tallest building in the world. The\nsame heroes are walking into the worst sand storm and walking out in\nthe most expensive model of BMW. Wow! If we skip all the money invested\nin the movie and very solid film crew along with the actors, it looks\nlike the core idea for the movie has been written by a very small\nchild. Don't get me wrong, I love fairy tales but even they have to\nfollow some logic and style. Frankly, the only thing that amazes me in\nthis movie is Tom Cruz, this guy looks the same in last 25 years.\n"},
{"review": "\nDialogue was god awful, couldn't make it past the first 30 minutes. I\nknow movies are supposed to have a bit of a leeway when it comes to\nbeing believable but this was just so ridiculous. We are just supposed\nto believe all this insane technology exists and its really this easy\nto break out of a prison. Come on! No way! It would happen way more\nthen, at least make it seem difficult. I saw the IMDb reviews and I was\nlike oh its rated 7.7 this should be better than I think its going to\nbe. How is it rated this high? It's like a child wrote it. Walked out\nand got a refund. Not worth the price of a ticket. Don't waste your\nmoney. Wait until it comes out see it for free.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'd say, this is a very poor effort to save the franchise. I think,\nthat even MI3 was better. For god sake, in the first part of the\ninstallment they've sticked a flying helicopter in a train tunnel! Was\nthere anything THAT special or extraordinary in this movie except CGI\nKremlin explosion (which was shown in the trailer) and the Burj-Dubai\nscene (you can find some videos of base-jumpers making jumps from it on\nthe net, so there's nothing that surprised me)? NO. Absolutely nothing.\nThey've even tried to make two people chasing the slow-riding train\nlook exciting and funny! How retarded is that for a Mission Impossible\nmovie? OK, I'll admit, I loved that \"holographic-corridor\" thing, but\nthat's about it... And how weird it is to read all the positive reviews\nabout this movie and people praising it as a quality come-back.\nPersonally, I think this movie is very mediocre and even worse than\nsome of the lower- budget and promotion action movies that been out\nlately.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe first half of the movie is probably the best action movie of the\nlast 20 years. It is intense, well shot, engaging and absolutely\nstunning visually. The stunts and action set in Budapest, Moscow and\nDubai and are absolutely fantastic and make the movie. Unfortunately\nthe movie slows down greatly in the second half of the movie (or is it\ntwo thirds/one third?) in Mumbai and loses itself in some common genre\ntraps: too much explaining stuff that doesn't make sense and some\nfairly 'average' action. It's a small gripe, probably half explained by\nthe fantastic beginning of the movie. The cast is the best of the\nseries: Jeremy Renner is a good addition, Lea Seydoux is a pretty cool\nvillain and the female lead whose name escapes me is somebody I wish I\nwould have seen in another movie? And Cruise is Cruise, he's the man in\nthis saga. A great movie overall, well done Brad Bird!\n"},
{"review": "\nI've been watching all of the Tom Cruise \"Mission Impossible\" movies in\npreparation for \"Rogue Nation\", and I must say that \"Ghost Protocol\" is\nthe best film of the franchise so far (having not seen \"Rogue Nation\"\nyet).<br><br>I'll admit that I am a fan of these movies and always have been.\nEpisode 2 is the lone let down in the series, with the first and third\nmovies both being fantastic. But \"Ghost Protocol\" just takes the series\nto a new level. This one really has some dynamic special effects, and\nit emulates the style of the third movie but manages to have an even\nmore engaging and thrilling plot (although the script of Episode 3 is\nhard to beat).<br><br>That said, you really can't go wrong with \"Ghost Protocol\".

{"review": "\nThis film is boring right from the pathetic title sequence and never\nresembles the original TV series ever.

Come to think about it, what were the other\ntwo films even about, do you remember? You will forget this film except\nfor one or two silly scenes involving weather and high places. I would\nhave been more excited by character development and an actual story but\nI guess that's just an impossible mission to pull off these days when\nmoviegoers seem to be entertained by special effects and glitz.

He uses excellent timing, makes sure we know that\nis Tom up there on the side of the building and gives us a few\nsurprises during the scenes.

He is casual about the\naction when he needs to be, he is intense when it requires it and he is\na truly likable action good guy. If they had half stars I would give\nthis an 8.5.

{"review": "\nIs it me or at the beginning of the movie when agent Hanaway(Josh\nHolloway)jumps off the roof and turns around to shoot the bad guys, as\nhe is flying backwards he looks a lot(too much) like Tom Cruise? Slow\nit down and see for yourself. Also, did anyone notice that in his last\nmovies, Cruise always finds an occasion for showing us how fast he\nruns? Great movie for fun, don't go looking for great acting. Even\nthough, let us hope that they continue putting money in entertaining\nmovies like this one... and maybe throw some good acting also. Why\ndidn't they put Ving Rhames only for a couple of seconds? Bye guys,\nthanks for the attention.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw this movie twice and it was the best movie I have seen in years!\nI am not into action movies, However, this was the exception. It was so\namazing that I had to see it twice! I didn't see the other three films\nbut now that I have seen this one I really want to. However, you do not\nneed to see the other three films to enjoy this film. Tom Cruise is one\nof my favorite actors, and as usual I was not disappointed by his\nperformance in the film. I thought Simon Pegg also did a really amazing\njob as Tom Cruise's side kick. I enjoyed the part of the movie when Tom\nwas climbing the side of the hotel in Dubai. It was so cool that this\npart was incorporated in the film. It was exciting, exhilarating and\nnerve racking. I could watch this movie 5 million times and still enjoy\nit.\n"},

Its Mission Impossible, however, and no other\ntelevision franchise has been able to pull off as successful a\nfollowing (outside of Star Trek) as this one. Sometimes it is hard to\nget over the \"Tom Cruise is a nut case\" thoughts, but what actor is not\na nut case ? If you let yourself get into the picture it moves at a\nvery rapid base till the last scene which moves very slowly till the\nfinal moments before the credit roll.

This time agent Ethan Hunt is\nafter a criminal that blew up the Kremlin and stole nuclear launch\ncodes. Him and his team track him down without the President's\napproval, hence the title, ghost protocol. The plot was easy to follow\nand not filled with holes. There was still some BS stunts, like Hunt\nflinging himself on a tall building, releasing his rope, and landing\nwhere the missing window was and being pulled to safety.

The only complaint I have is the villain. Not only do we get\nmaybe five minutes of screen time with him, but his motives seem a\nlittle questionable and he overall comes off as extremely weak.

It was very realistic, even though the IMF agency doesn't even\nexist. I could tell that the people in this movie did a really good\njob. Now, this movie might seem average, with the bombing of the\nKremlin, the IMF being disavowed, and Ethan Hunt going to save the IMF.\nNot average. This movie went down into the unexpected, with assassins,\nsmugglers and the U.S. government. Everyone did really good job in\nmaking this film. And the soundtrack was just amazing.

It is a shallow movie and sums up what is wrong with\nbig spending movies nowadays, there is absolutely NO moral attached to\nit, no charm, nothing but a sofa jumping self centered guy who has lost\nthe human touch. Is it a comedy, action or drama? because emotionally\nit is a bad roller coaster ride. the movie made me jump 4 times during\nthe movie and that is when Tom changes the scene, probably for waking\nme up.

{"review": "\nWhile there were several set pieces in this movie, it was totally\nlacking any narrative drive. Also, several indulgent scenes at the end\nshould have been edited out. Just a slack, pointless exercise in\nexecute vanity. A waste of two hours that I wish I had not seen.<br><br>The presence of Jeremy Renner didn't gel because he was cast against\nhis type as a passive analyst who had field skills not commensurate\nwith his job title.<br><br>There was too much amateur standing around talking about what we're\ngoing to do that was unnecessary and should have been displayed to us\nvia the dramatic exposition--the stuff that happens--not by having Tom\nCruise yack on about what he plans to do.\n"},
{"review": "\nYes, Tom is back for a forth outing and saving the world from an\nassortment of baddies in the process. MI4 definitely follows on from\nparts 2-3, as it's more action orientated and has a plot that you can\nactually follow (I've seen the first one three times and I'm still\nconfused at who was double-crossing who!).<br><br>Plus, Tom takes Brit actor Simon 'Shaun of the Dead' Pegg along for the\nride, which adds an acceptable dose of humour into the mix. There are\nstunts, shootouts, car chases - everything you'd expect from a MI film\n(or Bond movie) and it's all held together nicely.<br><br>It's a solid action film with enough gadgets to keep old-school Bond\nfans happy.

I would have rated it higher, but all I\nwould add is more clues that lead up to who the person is. It would\nkeep you hanging, and I love that.

{"review": "\nWhat really made this movie work is the lack of the super villain like\nin MI3, I thought Philip Seymour Hoffman ruined MI3 with his cheesy\nrole and thankfully the villain in MI4 is part of the story but not the\ncentral focus.<br><br>I also like the fact that they got the Ethan Hunt character back on\ntrack as a solo, single spy instead of a married spy like in MI3.\nHopefully they will keep the franchise going in the right direction\nespecially now that they've introduced the Syndicate as a group that\nHunt will be going up against in future movies.<br><br>Even though he's pushing 50, Cruise still proves that he can bring an A\nList action film to the big screen.

{"review": "\nNot to be taken for granted; your expectations are amped as Tom Cruise\nreturns as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt in this fourth installment of the\nMission:Impossible franchise.

Hunt is\nleft out in the cold and must gather a new team consisting of Jeremy\nRenner, Paula Patton and Simon Pegg to clear the name of the Agency.\nHunt suspects members of the new team may have individual agendas; but\nthe group must trust each other to complete a mission with practically\nno resources or backup. Exceptional scenery and special effects; and\nbecoming the norm, Cruise does his own stunts. But then this project\nhappens to be the highest-grossing film of Mr. Cruise's career. Kudos\nto cinematographer Robert Elswit. The cast also features: Samuli\nEdelmann, Michael Nyquist, Lea Seydoux, Josh Holloway and Goran\nNavojec.

{"review": "\nMission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is the most preposterous, insane and\nillogical film you'll see this year.

The story literally does not\nmatter(which is lucky because you've seen it before) when the action is\nthis fun. This high octane adventure will grip you from the first\nminute to the last. Just let yourself go and revel in 120 minutes of\npure, unadulterated fun.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie owes a lot of its shining value to Tom Cruise. He is getting\naged but his soul is backtracking when he shot the first MI. When I\nheard he did not accept using any stunt and did the action for himself,\nI could really enjoy his scene at the Dubai Burj Khalifa. But frankly\nspeaking, Ghost protocol is another MI, meaning nothing that special. I\nthink Mission Impossible attraction is on its unpredictable story and\nbrilliant and intelligent chase. High technique such as mask disguise\nand gum bomb reminded me of classic 007 movie, which I liked. But part\n4 Ghost protocol is going way too far. I can't understand all the\nmagics that the IMF agents are using. Well, people are aware of what is\nMI like already, so that's why I felt boring about those skills.\nNevertheless, with only one stunt scene at Burj Khalifa, this movies\nbecomes one of the best action movie in history.\n"},

How many\nfranchises can you say that about and mean it? I'm not a big fan of\nreal life Tom Cruise but putting that aside, he proved that he still\nhas the action chops with this late year gem.

The movie is bad in action,\ndoesn't seem any thrill in the movie at all and the characters it feels\nwere given the movie script on the day movie scenes were supposed to be\nshot. Maybe just like some other series like James Bond or The Bourne\nseries Cruise should be replaced, which seems not possible.

Tension is built by having smart characters do\nsmart things and still the hero comes out on top. This movie makes it\nlook like spies go into the field with lots of faulty equipment. These\nitems would be throw away by Bond's Q. I guess it's just par for the\ncourse for these movies, the first one was the only one that carried\nany weight in the spy genre.\n"},
