{"review": "\nThere's no other way to say it; Creed is a knockout. <br><br>From start to finish, this film exhilarates and crackles with brilliant\non screen performances and masterfully directed fight sequences. It\nwholeheartedly captures what was so brilliant about the first film: the\ncharacters. Yes, I'll return to theaters to see the fights, but it's\nthe characters, particularly Rocky and Adonis that truly captivated me\nfrom start to finish. <br><br>I can't say enough great things about writer/director Ryan Coogler. The\nway he masterfully captures the modern spirit of Philadelphia and the\nvisceral tension of standing toe-to-toe with a man who wants to see you\nhit the ground is second to none. What stood out the most, however, was\nhis writing of Rocky Balboa. The subtle nuances that we love about the\nItalian Stallion are effortlessly worked into the script and flow like\nwater from Sly's crooked mouth. Speaking of, the script would be for\nnaught if it weren't for the beautiful performances by Michael B.\nJordan and Sylvester Stallone. I'm not ashamed to say I was brought to\ntears at various parts of this film. <br><br>I'm just so happy to say that this film wasn't a disappointment. This\nfilm exceeded my wildest hopes of a 7th Rocky installment and had me\nfeeling amped up for hours after the credits rolled. I can't wait to\nsee more from the talent involved in this film, and I proudly endorse\nand recommend Creed to Rocky fans and film fans alike.\n"},
{"review": "\nMilking the franchise for everything it's got, Sylvester Stallone\nreturns as Rocky Balboa in the 7th installment in the series. This\ntime, he's smart enough to know he's too old to get into the ring, so\nhe gets some new blood with a familiar name.<br><br>Micheal B. Jordan plays Adonis(perfect name), a man who was in his\nmother's womb while his father, the legendary Apollo Creed got his ass\nhanded to him in the 4th Rocky. With the same passion to fight as his\nfather, he seeks out Apollo's old rival and best friend the Italian\nStallion to teach him the skills to reclaim his legacy and become a new\nlegend.<br><br>Like a good boxing movie should, Creed has heart. I'm such of fan of\nMicheal B. Jordan. He's got the charm and talent to become a movie star\nand Creed proves he's leading man material.<br><br>And much respect to Sly, who as an aged Rocky, is in the same spot as\nonce franchise regulars, Micky and Paulie. It's humbling for a movie\nstar to take a step back and let Jordan drive the vehicle in front of\nthe camera, and Ryan Coogler sit in the director's chair and pen the\nflick, but obviously Sly cares about this cow and sought out the very\nbest to make it the very best. Stallone also gave a performance of a\nlifetime worthy of an Oscar nod for supporting actor. He is Rocky, and\nwatching him on the screen with Jordan was incredible cinema.<br><br>And the action in this movie was amazing. Some of the greatest battles\nin cinematic boxing are happening in Creed. We are so close to the\naction you can feel every hit. Also have to comment on Jordan's boxing\nskills. Creed, does an excellent job with showing a boxer going from\nhaving raw talent, to becoming a champion.<br><br>Definitely a worth wild boxing movie to see, and I think the best Rocky\nfilm since number two.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst off let me say that I have been a life long Rocky fan. With that\nbeing said I went into this film very cautious as almost the entire\ncast and crew were brand new. The trailers looked good, but today a\ngood trailer is not necessarily an indicator of a good film. Sylvester\nStallone killed it as a much older and more breakable Rocky. Michael B.\nJordan's performance was as good if not better than Sly's. I think that\nfrom this day forward anytime I see Jordan, I will think of him as\nCreed and not whatever character he is playing. The story was\nengrossing and well thought out. The film pays a great amount of\nrespect to the Rocky films while at the same time carving out it's own\nplace in boxing film history. Honestly I have no idea how accessible\nthis film would be to someone who's never seen a Rocky film, but I\nthink the way the story flows it wouldn't be too much of an issue.\nAgain, highly recommended.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhy is this movie getting such good reviews? There is nothing here. The\nplot is just like all the rest of the Rocky movies, they even bring\nback the poor chickens. Lots of jump rope too. Oh, sorry not exactly\nlike the other Rocky movies, nobody died in this one, but he did visit\nthe cemetery. <br><br>Some stupid love interest that never went anywhere. An opponent that\ndidn't even look like a boxer. Not enough boxing, probably because\nStallone thought he could act well enough to carry the movie.<br><br>Creed: Please Rocky, come back and train me. Critic: Please Rocky, just\ngo away.\n"},
{"review": "\nCreed is the 7th installment in the Rocky franchise but this time\nfocuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. He wants to follow in his\nfather's footsteps and is trained by Rocky Balboa himself. More than\nboxing, this movie really goes into the relationship between Creed and\nRocky and how they both support each other when they most need it.\nMichael B. Jordan is fantastic as Creed. He is so energetic in the\nboxing scenes and he is even better when his character is being\ndeveloped. Now we come to Sylvester Stallone as Rocky. In his signature\nrole, he absolutely knocks it out of the park in what may have been his\nbest performance in his career as an actor. He honestly deserves an\nOscar for this part. He brought tears to my eyes on multiple occasions\nand still has the same charm from the old Rocky movies. <br><br>Creed perfectly mixes elements from past Rocky movies, especially the\nfirst, with modern culture. The amazing Rocky score is complemented by\nmodern styles. Creed's story is told just like Rocky's and it is so\nbeautiful to watch. The cinematography is also visually pleasing.\nCoogler captured the look of Philadelphia extremely well. The boxing\nscenes are excellent. There is a fight that is done completely in one\ntake and I have no idea how they did it. It was amazing. This movie is\na drama that tugs at your heart a lot, but at times it still manages to\nbe quite funny as well. <br><br>I love Creed as a film. Its characters are so well realized and acted,\nthe cinematography is gorgeous, and the boxing is glorious. Creed is\ndefinitely one of the best films of 2015. Creed gets an A.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe 7th (and hopefully last) movie of the Rocky franchise seems to be\nconsidered the best after the original by the critics but don't believe\nthe hype cause it's merely disappointing. The movie on the surface\ntries to go to a different direction exploiting all underground\nstereotypes. The hero is a young black that listens to hip hop. Rocky\nhas retired and manages his wife's Italian restaurant. The biker gangs\nof Philadelphia support them. The young fellow is in war with his last\nname, Creed, and what that represents. The easily foreseen screenplay\nincludes amped-up training sequences and climates to a title fight with\nan absurd number of punches landed in every round. Stallone's character\nsuffers from (spoiler alert) cancer and there you have a golden globe\nfor him as well an Oscar nomination (wtf?) for best performance in a\nsupporting role. Stallone getting an Oscar sounds like the academy is\ntrolling us. The movie is extremely overrated (8.0 in IMDb, 94% in\nrotten tomatoes) but even for a Rocky fan (as I am) it's extremely\npredictable and completely lacks emotion.<br><br>Grade: C- (D if you are not a Rocky fan)\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst of all, I like to start out that the acting was pretty good,\nespecially Sylvester Stallone, who is of course: \"Rocky\". The big\nproblem with this movie is that it was written and directed by some one\nother than Sylvester Stallone. In all the Rocky movies Stallone was the\nwriter, and besides the first Rocky and The fifth Rocky, Stallone was\nalso the director. What my point is, is that this random dude, that\nboth Wrote and directed this movie, made the movie \"Creed\", with his\nown style and junk that has never been in any of the 'Rocky\" movies,\nand the story was very poorly written, as well as the whole flow to it.\nI really hated the sensuality in it, as well as the reasons why Adonis\nCreed became a full time boxer. The movie \"Rocky\" had so much more\ninnocents and class and just the story all in all , just made so much\nmore sense. Most importantly I felt no \"Motivation\" to \"Creed\" as a\npose to \"Rocky\", because the story of \"Rocky\" just felt so real and\ninnocent and full of purpose, which is complete opposite in the movie\n\"Creed\". In the movie \"Rocky\" you felt the motivation. Overall, to\nbasically summarize everything, this movie had no class nor respect,\nfor the previews movies, and the writing was so lame and so empty.\nPretty much \"Creed\" was made for only one purpose... Money, cause the\nmost of the stuff in this movie was a complete fail. The Creator of\nthis movie knew that people would come to watch it,because of how great\nthe \"Rocky\" series were, but like i said before, this movie was a\ncomplete bust, with only one intention, to put Rocky's name in this\nterrible film just to make money.\n"},

{"review": "\nAlthough young Michael B. Jordan has the title role in Creed the film\nreally belongs to Sylvester Stallone. Sly joins an exclusive club of\nplayers like Bing Crosby, Paul Newman, and Al Pacino who got two Oscar\nnominations for playing the same role. In the case of Sly and Newman\nboth aged naturally into the parts of Rocky Balboa and Eddie Felson.\nIt's hard to believe that it has been 39 years since Stallone debuted\nRocky Balboa. It's also 39 years between the nominations that Stallone\ngot for Best Actor for Rocky and Best Supporting Actor for Creed.<br><br>But between that there have been several Rocky films over the years as\nSly has developed more facets to the fighting Mr. Balboa of\nPhiladelphia than I'm sure he even thought of when he debuted Rocky. It\nall really comes together with Creed.<br><br>But as for the story it seems that back when Apollo Creed was killed in\nthat fight with that Russian steroid machine Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV\nhe had a dalliance that resulted in a post mortem birth of an\nillegitimate son who grew up to be Michael B. Jordan, character name of\nAdonis Johnson. Apollo's widow Phyllis Rashad took him out of foster\ncare as his natural mother had died and raised him.<br><br>Jordan has an interesting dichotomy to deal with. He's his father's son\nand wants to make it in the fight game, but on his own as Adonis\nJohnson. He seeks his father's old friend and rival Rocky Balboa as a\nmentor and Rocky trains him for a title shot at the light heavyweight\nchampionship. <br><br>Rocky Balboa is not the most articulate movie hero ever developed, but\nhe sure imparts a lot of wisdom to Jordan. Those scenes with Jordan are\nwhat got Sly Stallone that second Oscar nomination. Also Rocky has some\npersonal crises of his own to deal with. These guys are of incalculable\nhelp to each other.<br><br>I really loved this film and how Stallone developed Rocky to this\npoint. Like fine wine, Rocky gets better with age.\n"},
{"review": "\nAfter looking at the ratings, I was curious to know, why this movie was\nnot nominated at the Golden Globes, Was it because of the tough\ncompetition?

Secondly, the movie is full of clich\u00e9s, from starting to End.\nYou watch, each and every element, unfold, just like all Sports movies.\nKnowing what will happen Next. The movie lacked an angle, playing on an\nangle about being Creed's Blood is not that catchy. The movie had some\nreally sloppy contrived moments, specially When Creed finds the\nhospital brochure in Rocky's jacket and finds out that Rocky has\nCancer. Now, why would Creed check Rocky's jacket. The whole scene\nlooks contrived The moment when Creed runs and Bikers move around him\nand Rocky looks at him from the top and everyone is cheering for their\nfavorite boy Creed, that is too old school and not something you expect\nfrom a great movie. The movie worked well in bits and pieces. The point\nwith Rocky was that his opponents had a character, They did try to\nbuild Creed's opponent's story, but it was not well executed. Too many\nscenes featuring Creed and Bianca.. But Creed had its moments, Yes,\nRocky looked like a pro,the way he dealt with situations, the way he\nwas analyzing the moves of the opponent, he makes you feel that this is\nthe same Rocky, I had cheered for in the past.\n"},

{"review": "\nTo me this is the second best Rocky movie out there. I mean I know It's\nreally more of an Adonnis movie, but you get my drift. To start, the\ncasting of Michael B Jordan as the son of Apollo Is perfectly done, I\nhonestly couldn't picture anyone else taking the mantle. Stallone\ncarries on from Balboa being brilliant on screen, even earning an Oscar\nnod, also hold up. I have to say I think the whole premise of Rocky\nbeing completely and utterly vulnerable for the first time due to\ncancer in this movie is the perfect way to take the character. Here is\na man who has long reigned as a somewhat king of the world type figure,\nat the end of his time, but before he goes he passes the torch to a new\nchampion. Amazing, just amazing. Mind you ... my only gripe with this\nmovie is that unlike in the previous Rocky movies, I saw next to no\nimportance of the antagonist in this movie. But other than that Creed\nis a brilliant way at breathing new life into the Rocky franchise.\n"},

Fortunately those fears were\nunfounded and whilst the film could be said to follow the same Rocky\nformula, it could easily stand on its own if you knew nothing of the\nprevious movies.

Over the years he\nhas almost become the character and plays him with such conviction.\nSylvester Stallone missed out on an Oscar for his performance for the\nfirst Rocky and recently was robbed for reprising his most famous role.\nHis performance in this film is really that good. This time playing an\nolder more fragile version of the famous character. Lets not forget\nthat this is a Rocky film just reinvented for the new generation.

{"review": "\nCreed is the seventh instalment in the Rocky franchise but this time\nfocuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. Adonis Creed is\nspectacularly played by the perfectly cast Michael B. Jordan in what\nmay be his best role and performance to date. The movie once again\nfeatures Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa - Stallone's performance is\nsurprisingly effective; he embodies the character perfectly after Rocky\nBalboa in 2006, ten years ago. His acting in this movie is far better\nthan you might expect from him at this stage, but you will be\npleasantly surprised - he won Best Supporting Acting at the Golden\nGlobes for a reason. Tessa Thompson plays Bianca, Adonis' love\ninterest, who gives a deceptively complex character that adds something\ngreat to the movie. <br><br>What the movie gives for the first half is familiar fare for these\nmovies - displaying the well earned nostalgia that these movies have\nearned - but at the same time director Ryan Coogler manages to revivify\nthe series, and through his strong and clearly talented directing makes\nthe movie stand alone as a genuinely strong dramatic piece. For long\ntime fans of the series, this movie will be particularly emotionally\npotent, but even to new time fans this is will still be a strong movie.\nCinematographer Maryse Alberti does a great job shooting the movie and\nin his own right adds something excellent to the movie (an almost five\nminute boxing scene which is all shot in one take is particularly\nmesmerising).<br><br>In conclusion, Creed is an excellent movie - the best since the 1976\noriginal, which can, in a large part, be put down to Ryan Coogler's\nfantastic directing. The characters are very strong, in particular\nMichael B. Jordan's, and the acting also great. It does justice to the\nprevious movies while at the same time trying something new and\neffective.\n"},

Sure, they got pretty campy in the later\nentries and ended up nearly being a parody of itself by the end in\nRocky 5, but there's no denying the dialogue. This film was grittier\nand much better than the 4 and 5, but paled greatly to the first two.\nTo this day when watching 1 or 2, after seeing them for the umpteenth\ntime, I still find myself rooting for the Rock and feeling inspired.

{"review": "\nRocky is a landmark film. A great. The series slowly declined, trading\ngritty characters and dialogue for hollow blockbuster shenanigans.

It\nwill resonate to audience, old and young, infectiously inspiring in\nevery sense.<br><br>Fighting is the most elementary form of drama, you have the protagonist\nand antagonist as they square off with their fists.

In fact, I was rooting for Ricky throughout the finale.\nAlso, the first round of boxing in the finale was great, but from the\nsecond round on it was a punch-for-punch remake of the original Rocky.<br><br>After 90 minutes, I was thoroughly bored and waiting for the film to\nend.

{"review": "\nI can't believe Creed has so much praise, did I watch the same film?\nFirstly, I thought Ryan Coogler did an excellent job with Fruitvale\nStation and that's the reason I wanted to see Creed, not because I'm a\nfan of Rocky, which I'm not. I did expect this to be enjoyable though\nand I expected it to be easy to follow without having seen the\noriginals but the film didn't suck me in at all and instead I was\nquestioning everything because I wasn't engaged. Why does Rocky, a\nfamous ex-boxer, live in a terrible house? It's never explained why a\nformer champion boxer has decided to live a meagre lifestyle and what\nhappened to all his wealth (if this was shown in Rocky III then it\nwould perhaps have been nice to allude to it here). I also didn't\nunderstand why Adonis, whose mother is incredibly wealthy, chooses to\ndrive a van around and quits a good job to go and fight. Yes, he loves\nfighting, but why does he love fighting? We don't get a real feel for\nany of the characters before suddenly Adonis is moving in with Rocky\nwho inexplicably is perfectly happy to have him and his girlfriend\nsleeping on his couch when they both have their own apartments.\nNormally I would be fine connecting the dots and just going with it but\nit was so boring I couldn't help but notice the sheer amount of\nstupidity in the script that we're supposed to believe for no reason.\nThe fight sequences are quite well done, the film is well photographed\nand the actors do a fine job but the script is awful in my opinion;\nflat characters, trite dialogue and inexplicable plot developments\nwould be fine in an otherwise entertaining comedy or horror film but\nnot in a drama like this.

What 'Creed' did differently: it relied less on the nostalgia\nfactor than TFA. I think that this helped the film stand out on its own\nand it was overall a great move. That said, I felt that there were a\nfew things missing. The Rocky theme disappeared completely. I would\nhave thought that since Apollo told Rocky, \"Eye of the tiger,\" that\nperhaps Rocky should have said the same thing to Adonis. Perhaps that's\njust me. That said, Michael B.
