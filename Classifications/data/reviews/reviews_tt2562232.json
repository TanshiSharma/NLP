I don't know if this is a spoiler\nalert or not, but if you're waiting for the moment when the loose ends\nare all tied together in any coherent manner, you will be waiting in\nvain. That said, Michael Keaton and the cast give wonderful if\nsometimes overacted performances. You can see why critics like it -\nit's not the pap that they are forced to view day in and day out\nbecause it's their job to watch it. Professional critics, for their own\nsanity, grasp at any opportunity to promote something different or\nunusual. But just because it's good for them doesn't make it good for\nus, the casual movie goer. Since this is a play within a movie that is\nset in a theater, I got the feeling that there are inside jokes that\nthose in or familiar with the business (such as critics) will get but\nwhich is over the heads the audience.\n"},

Actually to be honest i have\nnow long given up on what critics say and write about a film. Virtually\ncritic on both sides of the Atlantic seem to have lost any sense of\nwhat is good or bad. The amount of critically endorsed films that i\nhave thought to be not bad but very bad seems to be growing each year.\ni have been a serious movie goer for some time now. i also have noticed\nthat after a year or so these lauded films seem to get reconsidered ,\nwhere the original praise is vastly reduced.\n"},

{"review": "\nWhilst viewing 'Birdman', I spent the first hour of the film trying to\ndecipher my emotions and opinions towards it, what I was watching was a\nweird, yet wonderful work of art. Truly though, 'Birdman' is a\ntechnical masterpiece. Michael Keaton has generally been undermined as\nan actor (despite a few notable roles as Batman or Beetlejuice) and has\ninstead faced Hollywood picking more acclaimed and popular actors,\n'Birdman' however might just be his ticket to an Oscar nomination, and\npossibly even a win, his performance is mesmerising. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu has created a truly spectacular character study that arguably\nfeatures this year's strongest acting performances, alongside a well-\nexecuted script, booming soundtrack and a monumental achievement with\ncinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki in which he attempts a\nHitchcockian approach, reminiscent of 'Rope', and displays the story\nthrough a seemingly single and unbroken sweeping shot. This is the true\ndefinition of a masterpiece.\n"},

{"review": "\nComing in to this movie, I had heard bad things from people who had \r\nseen it but great things from critics. After leaving, the only good \r\nthing about it was the acting. This movie definitely was different and \r\nunique, but there's a difference from being different and making art \r\nand being different and making a piece of crap. The fact that this \r\nmovie was nominated for best picture above a piece of art, such as \r\nInterstellar, is appalling. I do applaud the director for taking a risk \r\nand trying to make an unconventional movie, but he needed to first \r\ndevelop a plot in order to make a good movie. I strongly discourage \r\nanyone from wasting their time and money seeing this. If you want to \r\nwatch a movie that is different and considered art, watch any \r\nChristopher Nolan, Stanley Kubrick, or Quentin Tarantino movie, not \r\nthis pathetic excuse for entertainment. And to critics, please learn \r\nthe difference between unconventional artistic movies and this bloody \r\nrubbish.\n"},

Even the\nso called super hero Birdman is laughable. I guess judging by the\nreviews, you are either going to love this or hate this. My advice to\nyou, if you like the first 15 minutes, then keep watching, you might\neven consider this a masterpiece. However, if after 5 minutes, you\nthink it's going to get better? You best turn it off and don't waste\nyour time.\n"},

The same admiration that chained him to\nBridman, who is probably the only one capable of saving him.<br><br>The cinematography reminds of that used in Hitchcock's \"Rope\": it seems\nto be filmed consequently.

In this film, if you close your eyes, you\ncan't tell who's speaking, and like Rhett Butler, frankly you don't\ngive a damn.The writers seemed to believe that constant, mindless\nprofanity would create viewer interest. Instead,all that puerile use of\ncopulative, sodomistic language numbs the brain.<br><br>I had a dental appointment the next day, and the dentist asked what I\nthought of the movie. My reply...\"I think i just wasted two plus hours\nof my life.\" And at my age it's a helluva loss. In summary, it puzzles\nme that the Academy could find any redeeming qualities in this avian\nmisadventure.\n"},

Well, this was all what I had to say but according\nto the IMDb rules, now I will have to write 10+ lanes, so here it goes.\nI was sorry for the great actors who had to participate in this\n\"artistic\" craziness. All characters are just wondering around along\nwith the camera during the movie, seemingly not knowing at all what\nthey should do or say. So most of the time they just say something\nrandomly and act according to that. I was really surprised that it got\nso good reviews. Nevertheless, short sequences are played great e.g.\nEmma Stone with Edward Norton on the balcony. That short sequence alone\nmade me learn Emma Stone's name - she is truly fantastic.

In doing this he\nmeets a few obstacles such as a bad relationship with another actor and\nsome unfavourable newspaper critiques. And personally he has got a\nconflict with his daughter.

{"review": "\nThis movie is a twisted emulation of \"nouvelle vague\" films, created by\na wannabe director whose pretentious tones made this movie even more\nridiculous than its premise which is basically to criticize the modern\nentertainment film industry, which we know is fairly well known by its\nexcesses.<br><br>The director aimed to emulate one shooting type of film perhaps to make\na homage to Goddard's mannerisms( or should I say inflated ego ?) and\npreference for unsteady cameras. The dialog between characters are\nutterly boring and lack cohesion and make abusive use of improvisation,\nafter all, a film is a project of real life.<br><br>For those that enjoy the uttermost boring and insipid type of story\ntelling, a.k.a modern pseudo-artsy which is promoted by independent\nfilm producers this is a rattling must see film which is only saved by\ngood actors- all of them - and the percussive soundtrack which succeeds\nas a art product to be applauded at least.\n"},
{"review": "\nPeople are easily impressionable. All you need to do sometimes is come\nup with lots of flash, even if the substance doesn't follow. The cast\nis good, and seeing Keaton again, a quite particular actor, playing a\nlead role in a major production is very endearing. Emma Stone plays\nvery well, surprisingly. The cast is globally strong, with Norton and\nWatts, two very good actors, as mere seconds here. Technically, the\ncinematography is very detailed and constantly sought after, and\nunfortunately that's where all the people fall into the obvious trap.\nThe film has substance, but not a whole lot, not anything that hasn't\nbeen done a bunch of times before, and although it makes for a good\nviewing, the absence of a strong morality or even conclusion at all\nsinks this one. It's a fine, eventful movie, but it's not even close to\nmasterpiece territory like lots are implying or outright saying. And\nthe ending tries hard to be poetically abstract but really doesn't mean\nmuch (AND is taken from another film).\n"},
{"review": "\nI wanted to see what all of the hype was about. So I finally sat down\nto watch it last night. I made it thru an entire (20 minutes) before\nturning it off.

But this movie just seemed weird, the plot\n(was there even a plot? lol ) felt disconnected and It was dry and\nboring. At least most of the movies that have been Oscar winners had a\ngreat story, characters, or something to keep you interested.<br><br>This movie had nothing to justify me wasting 2 hours of my life.

{"review": "\nBirdman is a powerhouse of cinema. Throwing away the commentary on\ncritics and the movie industry and artistic integrity; it's still a\nlive, thriving beast that has so much unpredictability in every scene.\nIt has raw, powerful, career-defining performances, ridiculously\nimpressive camera-work, surrealistic cinematography and an always\ninvolving story that gives the film ground even with it's surrealistic\nmoments (something the Tree of Life lacked a bit). You can just feel\nthe energy, the tension, and the off-beat score drum score is\nimpeccable. Anyway that's all I have to say about Birdman. It's my 2nd\nfavourite film of all time (after Synecdoche, New York) and the only\nproblem with this film is that it's too big, too alive to watch on a\nnormal television screen. Honestly, it's not Gravity, Avatar or even\nIntestellar. This is the definitive cinema experience. 10/10\n"},

Whatever it was, it was not in any way good.\nIt felt like a sophomoric attempt to be meta, which the actors giving\ntheir lines like they're trying to project in a play, but it didn't\nwork. Honestly, I think I'd have preferred to watch the Birdman TV show\nor movies or whatever, because frankly, even the worst, cheesiest\nsuper-hero show is better than this pseudo-intellectual poser crap.\nTwitter and Facebook are somehow important or relevant?

In fact, I'm not sure the director or writer\nbothered to come up with a target audience at all, aside from\nthemselves.

Birdman stars Michael Keaton, who once starred as Batman, is\npretty much playing himself, as is Norton who's known as a notoriously\ndifficult actor to work with.

{"review": "\nThe script for the movie was boring though the plot and setting were\npromising. Ed Norton and Brittany Murphy have had more challenging\nroles.

The internal\ninsanity of the main character could have had more emotion.

I walked out near the end as I couldn't\ntake it anymore. I'd love to see what other people see in this, but I\nfeel mislead by the reviews and don't agree at all with critics\npraising this film ad-nauseam.

{"review": "\nI did not understand what this movie was about. But I guess that is how\nart films are supposed to be.

{"review": "\nMuch of the low reviews already hit on most of the painful points of\nthis movie, but I will summarize it as such:<br><br>Michael Keaton in a midlife crisis, playing himself whom is a\nschizophrenic actor playing himself in a midlife crisis.

The entire plot could easily be guessed within the first 5\nminutes.<br><br>In case it wasn't enough to entirely feed off the system of Hollywood\negotism, the director leaves a \"surprise ending\" which is supposed to\nleave you hanging. It is a pathetic cheap trick playing off the idea\nportrayed against the common media's reflection of Hollywood hogwash\nthat is commonly prodded throughout the movie. What I can't comprehend,\nhowever, is how the critics are so acceptable of this continual\nprodding as an acceptable movie plot.
