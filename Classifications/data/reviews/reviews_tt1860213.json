{"review": "\nIt's a real low for De Niro and Efron and I can not in my wildest\ndreams understand why this movie got green light... I can laugh at\nfunny sexual jokes, but this was at a level of 5 year old's. Complete\nwaste of money and the actor's and my time... unless the actors\nactually found it funny, and in that case I must admit I am a bit\nsurprised and disappointed. Besides the large amount of bad jokes,\nstupid, unfunny characters, an appalling backstory and completely flat\nnon-engaging character developments, the writing is also completely\nworthless. There is nothing really wrong with the actors performances,\nmaybe even better that one would expect considering the material they\nhad to work with. Maybe they all had a good time making the movie and\ngetting a few laughs at work, but the result was no laughing matter, I\nam sorry to say.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis might be a great movie for some audiences, obviously there are\nenough people who like such things, considering that they keep making\nthem and they become box-office hits. This movie relies on the typical\nAmerican exclusive sensation, on its dirtiness and dark humour. I'm a\nperson who is able to take a joke and understands dark humour, but this\nmovie is purely dirty, banal and unfunny. Many of the actors are\noveracting in their characters' dirtiness. It is pretty much a messed\nup commercial sh*t like Ted 2, except that at least there is not a\nliving teddy bear married to a slutty drug addict (thank God). It's\nlame how they mix up the banal sentimental moments with the tasteless\nhumour and the totally disgusting dirty moments which are supposed to\nbe entertaining. It's full of movies like this that have banal plots\nplus random dumb moments filled with massive drug use. Other than that,\nit's well-shot. At least this we could expect to be nice. It's not too\nbad if we take the fact I watched it at home and managed to watch until\nthe end.\n"},

I'm 42 and far from being a puritan, but\nsuch movies are American cinema's decadence. Comedy is the most\ndifficult genre. It is easy to write and make a drama, but what is\ndifficult is to make a real comedy with real humor. Only English and a\nbit the French are still able to do this. American comedy has become a\ncompilation of disgusting things including drugs and sexual fluids\ninnuendos and raw images that could make you throw up. I'm sorry but\nseeing a 73y.o. person masturbating, even if he is the greatest actor\nof all time, or innuendos of pedophilia cannot make me laugh.

Efron didn't manage to come\nacross as someone you'd empathize with. De Niro was an oddball. The\nrelationship Efron cultivated didn't stand out either. <br><br>My boyfriend laughed at a few scenes but after this movie he said \"I\nthink I lost some brain cells\".

Aubrey Plaza, an actor whom I admire greatly from Parks and\nRecreation, I am sad to say has stooped low enough from her unique\ncharacter April Ludgate, to portray a character who talks more about\nhuman sex organs than she does anything else, to a nauseating extent.\nRobert De Niro, whom I admire from all of the films he is known for,\nhas likewise adapted a character that presents the viewer with such\nforced humour that it begs the question of how the film was given the\ngreen light in the first place.

Funny thing is, the other girl Zac Efron falls for in\nthe film, Zoey Deutch (the cutey from Everybody Wants Some!!), is every\nbit as boring as the girl he's engaged to (Julianna Hough). Efron\nhimself isn't too bad as the straight man, but he works better in\ngoofier roles. I saw this mainly for Aubrey Plaza. She's hot as Hell in\nthis movie, and has some funny line readings, but I'm just too squicked\nout by her lust for Robert De Niro. I almost threw up in my mouth a\ncouple of times. So yeah, almost everything here sucks, but there are\ntwo big exceptions: Jason Mantzoukas and Adam Pally. Mantzoukas plays a\nnutty drug dealer named Pam (\"it's a nickname. It's short for Pamela\")\nand he brings a lot of life to the picture whenever he pops up. Pally\n(Happy Endings, The Mindy Project) doesn't get as much to do, but he\ngets a laugh even with the smallest line, and he has the movie's best\ngag as he has to act as a messenger between Efron and Hough at their\nwedding. I'd almost say it's worth watching just for Mantzoukas and\nPally if you're a fan of either of them. The rest of it is bad, but\nI've seen far worse.\n"},

{"review": "\nRecently widowed and set on living life to its fullest, a\nseptuagenarian tricks his grandson into driving him across the country\nin this lowbrow comedy starring Robert De Niro and Zac Efron. The plot\nis strikingly similar to 'The Intern' with its elderly protagonist\nwishing to find purpose after his wife's death, however, whereas some\ncommented that 'The Intern' was \"too sweet\", 'Dirty Grandpa' is the\npolar opposite. The gags are mostly vulgar, with more than a couple\ncoming off as existing simply for shock value (who would ever think\nthat we would watch De Niro pleasure himself one day?). Some of the\ncrude parts are admittedly very funny though, such as an angry parent\non the beach. The chemistry between De Niro and Efron comes off as very\nreal too, give or take their tendency to converse in expletives. In any\ncase, biggest drawback here is the predictability of the story rather\nthan its humour. Efron (of course) reevaluates his decision to marry so\nyoung while on the road trip and (of course) he meets an attractive\nalternative girlfriend who he (of course) loses and has to win back. It\nis a pretty generic storyline done countless times before. The presence\nof De Niro renders the film somewhat more unique though and to his\ncredit, he truly embraces the role and runs with it.

Raucous, outrageous and vulgar. Some\nof the dialogue is really quite good and made me laugh out loud and\nsome of it is a bit too try hard and almost cringe worthy. Some of the\nbetter dialogue reminded me of Superbad. Yes, there are a lot of\nmoments of Zac Efron with his shirt off. But he is in great shape - so\nfair play to him. He actually comes across as genuinely good fun in\nthis movie and him and De Niro actually strike up a pretty good\npartnership as they play off of one another and you can sense a genuine\naffection between them. This is what makes the movie enjoyable for me.\nIt will never be considered as a great comedy movie but it has the feel\ngood factor and is fun to watch throughout. It's definitely better than\nit's given credit for.\n"},
{"review": "\nFirst of all, I'd like to emphasize that this is a subjective review.\nI'm saying this because I've been called hater or without sense of\nhumor because I didn't like it. But, I just don't see what is funny\nabout it. I didn't like trailer and I rejected invite to go see it in\nthe cinema. But few of my good friends told me that it's \"the funniest\nmovie they've seen in a long time\" so I decided to give it a try. Worst\nspent 45 minutes of my life (yup, I didn't manage to watch it whole).\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not a nun, but this was awful. Humor based on\nthe exaggerated use of words like f*ck, sh&amp;t, di%k, pu#@y, brings me to\nthe time of first years in high school, when biology teacher said\n\"pe#is\" and a bunch of teenagers burst into laugh. I wasn't expecting a\nromantic movie, but also didn't expecting this so called humor based on\ncompilation of swearing and insulting. And Robert De Niro in the role\nof old man who lost his wife, and the first thing he does is trying to\nlaid a girl who could be his granddaughter (by the age, not blood) -\njust no. Only reason I gave it 3* is because of the Effron's and De\nNiro's ability to make the best with what was given to them, which, in\nthis case, wasn't too much. Anyhow, if you're in doubt should you watch\nit or not, I'm sure there are far better choices than this.\n"},

De Niro was just perfect for the\nWar Vet/dirty old man role and played it to perfection If you like\nAmerican Pie/Old School,The Hangover,Hall Pass which are all brilliant\nin my opinion then you will love this. Ignore all the haters they\nhaven't got a clue, what did you expect to see with the title Dirty\nGrandpa? great job guys made my evening, I wasn't expecting it to be as\ngood as it was I was very surprised my wife even came in from the front\nroom when she heard me laughing to investigate and sat through the\nremainder of the film laughing too.\n"},

Well, to start this section off, I\nwill genuinely say that if you do not appreciate vulgar R-Rated\ncomedies, do not see this movie. On another note, I thought this movie\nwas absolutely hilarious. Dirty Grandpa presents Robert De Niro in a\nway mostly never seen before. He rips out insults and jokes like he is\na freshly turned 21-year-old in a 72- year-old body. Zac presents\nhimself as a very uptight and by-the- book lawyer that has a\nfree-spirited past that he has since lost due to the strictness of his\nfather yet as soon as that uptight side is broken, this film is a wild\nride as the two tear apart the beaches of Florida. This movie is purely\na joke film, the story is forced in for the sake of film but it still\nworks, kind of.

And Zac Efron seems like a good sport\nto take on a role that makes him go from uptight college boy to regular\nguy with some total humiliation along the way. Was it tasteless, crude\nand vulgar? You bet it was! Some of the lines were jaw dropping-ly\noutrageous...and great! I laughed out loud a couple of times with a\nmixture of shock and disbelief. I loved it. If Robert Deniro has no\nproblem swearing like a NY cabbie and Zac Efron is not camera shy- who\nare we to complain?\n"},
{"review": "\nThe only nice thing about this movie is Zac Efron not wearing lots of\nclothes on some occasions.<br><br>Every clich\u00e9 that you can think of - you'll find it in this movie,\nincluding sexist jokes, \"dirty\" words, classic anal moments (yay\nbuttholes are hilarious).<br><br>I suppose some actors really needed the money, I cannot think of any\nother reason they participated.<br><br>Did I say the nice stuff? Oh right, Efron's butt. Piece of art,\nunfortunately not worth watching the whole movie. <br><br>Review is over.\n"},
{"review": "\nGiven the fact that Robert De Niro was one of the main characters in\nthis film, I began watching with the misguided impression that this\nwould be a clever and comical movie...offering at least some of the fun\nhumour presented in previous films such as Meet the Fockers, Last Vegas\netc.<br><br>How wrong I was! I can only assume that this film is some sort of\npunishment for De Niro issued by the parasitic overlords of\nholly-wood...maybe in response to his involvement in the controversial\n'Vaxxed' film. Or, it could just be some kind of inside the industry\n'hazing' type of thing...where the actors are forced to take on roles\nin crappy sub standard movies, to keep their position in the feculant\nand terminally diseased hierarchical system that is holly-wood.<br><br>If you want to waste a couple of hours of your valuable time, then pull\nup a chair, grab a glass of fluoride infused water, and watch it in\nyour yard...whilst you breathe in deep those lovely toxins from the\nchemtrails filling the sky above your head. This would be the target\naudience for this piece of low level drivel.<br><br>Clearly, De Niro and Efron are being the well behaved little puppets\nthat their overlords require...enjoy the pay check boys, you sure\nearned it by humiliating yourselves in this piece of mind dumbing\ngarbage. I want my money back!\n"},
{"review": "\nJust logged in to write a review.<br><br>I understand that the movie might appeal to some, if you liked Hangover\nor TED and if you laugh at lines like \"I want to f*ck\" this might be a\ngood show for you.<br><br>Otherwise don't waste your time, the movie is total garbage. It's\nbeyond my why an actor like Robert DeNiro signs up for stuff like this.\nIn all honesty as much as I like him, I think he was pretty bad in the\nmovie, sort of in-line with it I guess.<br><br>And what was that scene at the end where the bride couldn't hear the\ngroom and they were relaying the message across the room, it was\ncompletely retarded, it would make a 5 year old laugh maybe?<br><br>I knew it was going to be a raunchy road-trip comedy, but still it was\na huge disappointment, don't waste your time and money.\n"},
{"review": "\nDirty Grandpa is a film overflowing with crude humor and swearing that\nmanaged to actually be occasionally funny (occasionally being the\noperative word). The plot is almost unforgivably clich\u00e9 but hey, its a\ncomedy, and no one came here for the plot. I love De Niro and am very\nfond of Efron as actors and their performances weren't bad at all, they\njust seem wasted on such a truly uninspiring script. The supporting\ncharacters had their moments but the so called comic relief character\nhad more development than the ones who were supposed to be moving the\n\"plot\" forward. <br><br>So should you watch Dirty Grandpa? If you like dick jokes and swearing,\nsure why not.\n"},
{"review": "\nGosh! I watched it about a half hour ago and I still can't get out of\nthis movie's shock. Well, the idea of the story is not that bad. Jason\n(Zac Efron) plans his wedding with an annoying woman, and his grandpa\n(Robert DeNiro) wants to ruin the wedding. They are having a road trip,\nand the grandpa's only aim is having sex with a college girl. Yeah,\nweird. And the whole story is full of obscene words, there are no 5\nminutes without someone saying f*ck or something. But all of this could\nbe bearable, if there weren't be the most sick ending. So, if you want\nto watch this film after my opinion too, watch it online, so you won't\nthrow your money to a dust bane.\n"},
{"review": "\nIn a film filled with one liners and name calling, Dirty Grandpa fails\nto capture your attention and affection during the 102 minute film. Di\nNiro's character \"Dick Kelly\" and Zac Efron's character \"Jason Kelly\"\nseem forced through most of the film, leaving you to wonder if anyone\ncould have possibly pulled off the story line with this sad attempt at\nwriting comedy. The only real shining moments come from the supporting\ncast mostly being the Drug and Goodtime dealing Pam played by Jason\nMantzoukas, and the Daytona Beach police Mo Collins and Henry\nZebrowski. Overall Dirty Grandpa struggles to find its identity, and\nfails to provide the high profile actors with any chance of a\nsuccessful comedy classic.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have to confess something\u0085 I quite like Zac Efron. Now that may be a\nsurprise and even though he plays the cheesiest roles out there I find\nhim great to watch and he is a decent actor, watch him over the years\nand he could become something really good. But I digress, this film\nalso stars Robert De Niro and it was ultimately the trailer that made\nthis film look a fun watch.<br><br>Well fun it may have been, but oh dear the film on the whole was\nappallingly bad! Save for quite a few \"laugh out loud\" moments the\nstoryline was weak, the script shockingly bad and the rest of the cast\npretty poor. I was shocked at quite how vulgar this actually was, yes\nit's pitched as Dirty Grandpa but this was more like Filthy Grandpa and\nto say the filth was excessive would be an understatement. It's only\nwatchable due to De Niro being the one saying it, otherwise honestly we\nwould have walked out of this one.<br><br>So, whilst I still like and respect Efron and De Niro this film just\nisn't worth seeing in any shape or form\u0085 maybe in the afternoon on ITV2\nin a few years' time, but don't waste money on it!\n"},
{"review": "\nTruly wish I could get this time back in my life...<br><br>I'm going to keep this short, but to this day I can still not\ncomprehend what the actual point of this movie was. There was no real\nplot outline nor plot to it. There was a lot of talk about penis' and\nall that as well as crude behavior. The closest movie I can relate this\ntoo is the Wedding Ringer except that movie was a lot better in the\nsense there was a point it. My recommendation is to save your money and\nRed Box this or wait for it on Netflix. If your tripping on acid or\nsomething of the sort you might get what this movie is about and I\nstill can not believe that De Niro is in something like this. I was\nleft in utter confusion and frustration. Lets hope there will not be a\nsecond cause honestly I have no idea how or why...\n"},
{"review": "\nSo while this is a formula movie as I understand them, it was so\ncleverly done and completely inappropriate that its was completely\nenjoyable. The vocabulary of foul abusive and socially unacceptable\nlanguage is more complete than anything that I have experienced. I\nlaughed so hard that I was actually in physical discomfort by the end\nof the movie. The plot is not really worth mentioning since it was just\nthe vehicle for a continuous barrage of innovative and explicit\nprofanity. DeNiro as the vehicle of this profanity gave it credibility\nif that were actually possible. Its a pretty big IF but he does have a\ngift for this sort of irreverence. This movie wants you to step out of\nthe line of sedated idiots waiting to jump off a cliff and take a hard\nlook at the world that we have allowed to happen. If insane\nentertainment needs any other reason to exist beyond making you\nhappier, that is it. I would probably avoid a crowded theater as you\nwill likely miss too much of the show due to laughter and crowd noise.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was a waste of time, money, and Robert DeNiro's acting\nchops. There were few people watching this particular matin\u00e9e time and\nsome actually walked out. We found it extremely profane and vulgar. If\nwe could rate it zero, we would. No more movies EVER with Zac Efron or\nSeth Rogen. We weren't exactly thrilled Regal has raised the price on\ntheir Tuesday movie special - $5 tickets rose to $5.10. We don't really\nmind that but ARE offended by the Tuesday increase of a small popcorn\nfrom $2 to $3.30, especially when the theater is making so much money\non their popcorn sales already. Regal is evidently changing their point\nsystem. The more movies you see, the more points you can accumulate. If\nonly there were more quality movies to see!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is really the funniest movie I've ever seen. It literally gave me\nthe chills from the beginning until the very end. And this is not just\nmy opinion the whole cinema was laughing so hard sometimes I couldn't\nhear the lines so I had to read them. I think the scriptwriter did a\nfantastic job. The cast was also absolutely amazing. The mix with Zac\nEfron's talent and Robert De Niro's experience worked out great. They\nreally had chemistry between them. I think everything about this movie\nworked grade from the title to to very credits. Future project that\ninclude Zac Efron will definitely be top material. It also seems that\nRobert De Niro did not lost his touch when it comes to comedy.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is the worst movie I have ever seen. It was so bad that we ended\nup leaving 30 min after it started. Thought that since Robert De Niro\nwas in it would be good. WRONG. I can handle the bad language but every\ntime De Niro spoke he said F---- and F---king. Went with my\nmother-in-law and we couldn't believe how bad it was and there is no\nplot or story line. De Niro and Efron should be ashamed of making this\nmovie. There is not even one good comment I can type into this review\nbecause there were none.<br><br>I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Very disappointed and was\nextremely embarrassed.\n"},
{"review": "\nI went to see a movie to kill some time while waiting for my kids at\nthe mall, and I was delighted at my good fortune that there was a\nRobert De Niro movie playing. However, this was one of the grossest,\nmost unfunny movies I have ever seen. Had I not been just killing time,\nI would have walked out about ten minutes in, when De Niro is caught\njerking off by his grandson while watching a porno. It only gets\n\"better\" as he then spends the remainder of the film belittling his\ngrandson, playing grab ass with someone 50 years younger than him, and\nbeing one of the crudest, grossest, most unappealing characters I have\never had the misfortune of witnessing. Ick.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film revolves around a grandpa who was just had tragedy struck\ninto his life, and as a result wants nothing other than sex. Sounds\nlike this could be kind of interesting right? Like perhaps a solid 4/10\nfilm, that would get a few cheap laughs and soon be forgotten about?\nWrong.<br><br>Dirty Grandpa (starring Robert De Nero, just let that sink in) was an\nunfunny mess of a film, with horrible jokes that could only be possibly\nviewed as any form of humour by middle-schoolers, and a plot line that\nmade very little sense, with characters who make stupid choices along\nthe way. The \"humour\" in the film pretty much consists of \"jokes\"\ninvolving sex, drugs, making fun of a gay person, or blurting out\nrandom sexual words together in a form of an insult. Oh, and Robert De\nNero sticking his thumb up his grandsons butt.<br><br>This film is horrible. It is not worth seeing. At all.\n"},
{"review": "\nThere have been quite a few disastrous films made recently and this is\nnot one of them. I have not laughed this much in a very long time.\nRobert Deniro and Zac Efron are two of my favorite actors and their\nchemistry in this film is fantastic. I don't know why this movie got so\nmany bad reviews, people must have lost their sense of humor or are\njust plain prudes!!! I wasn't offended by anything, i actually thought\nfrom start to finish it was hilarious and is now one of my favorite\nfilms. Trust me, don't listen to the other critics and give this movie\na shot, you wont regret it. I will definitely be recommending it to my\nfriends!\n"},
{"review": "\nor at least my Top 3 of all time.<br><br>\"Dirty grandpa\" with Bobby De Niro.... I cannot recall in recent memory\nwhere I have seen such unbelievably bad writing.

It was just\nbizarrely stupid.<br><br>The Movie's attempt at gross humor or crude humor failed at every\nlevel.<br><br>The delivery of the jokes were totally disorganized , the timing and\ncontext of them were way off, and it was very forced and just all over\nthe place, like a 12 year old boy going through puberty would write.<br><br>I cannot believe that De Niro would stake his incredible Rep on a movie\nlike this.<br><br>A complete train wreck\n"},
{"review": "\nIt's awful movie. They're making bad things look okay and making the\npurpose of life silly and stupid. Drugs, sex, partying are the whole\npoint of this movie. There are trying to get to people minds with a\ncomedian way so they can convince you to believe they're right. I\npersonally didn't like the movie at all. It was boring, I was just\nwaiting to it to end. They're making cheating looks okay as well, if\nyou find a better person you can just leave. I mean what kind of\ngrandpa would encourage his grandson to cheat on his fianc\u00e9! And out of\nthe sudden, the grandson's feelings has totally changed when he met the\nnew girl! Like WTF! I expected something better. It has some funny\nstuffs but most of all are really awful in a sexual way. <br><br>Doesn't worth watching at all. Waste of time.\n"}
