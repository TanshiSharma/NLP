{"review": "\nTo be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be\nanother Disney movie gone bad. So when the movies came around, I had\nreally low expectations for it. But holy crap nothing has made me laugh\nthis hard at a movie since maybe Amelie or Up! Baymax is a\nnon-threatening huggable robot who's only purpose is to nurse those who\nare in need of medical attention. The only way to wake him up is to\nscream out \"OW\" and he is alive and will help you until you are better.\nThe only way to put him back to sleep is to say \"I'm satisfied with\nyour work\" (Or something like that I'm only paraphrasing) and he has\ngone back to sleep. But this movie isn't all comedy: it does have a bit\nof an emotional side to it which I won't go into too much detail about.\nHowever I do know that the movie isn't really like the comic books: the\nback stories of the characters aren't how they are in the movie and\neven the plot itself isn't like how the movie is, so for the devoted\ncomic book fans, I understand if you hate this movie. However the\npeople who didn't read the comics confuse me when they say it's\n\"Cliche\" \"awful\" \"boring\". I found none of these things in the movie at\nall. I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little\nteary-eyed towards the end. <br><br>So I do recommend this movie if you're up for a nice light movie with a\nlot of laughs: it might be better than you think.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe last time I left a cinema feeling anything close to this elated was\nafter Gravity. My heart was racing, I felt so joyful. I never feel like\nthis after a film. Big Hero 6 immediately replaces the Lego movie as my\nNo.1, main stream, animated film. <br><br>I came onto IMDb to find out more about this entertaining, action\npacked, emotional roller-coaster only to see half a dozen vicious\nreviews ... I feel so somber. I can't believe anyone would loath this\nfilm to the levels of some reviewers have gone to on this site. It was\nan absolute joy. The whole cinema was ecstatic, both kids and adults. <br><br>I have a 7 year old boy, and even without being a dad, I'd still love\nthis film. Hope it picks up the awards (Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA etc\netc) it deserves.\n"},
{"review": "\nPlease don't listen to the bad reviews and watch this yourself.<br><br>I registered with IMDb just to write this. That is how much faith I\nhave in this film. I really cannot believe some of these bad reviews..\n\"Not a kids film\"?? kids would go mental for this.<br><br>Animation was nothing short of exquisite<br><br>Comedy was extremely funny (and i'm not one for comedies)<br><br>Story line was really great too<br><br>Also made me cry a little... meh<br><br>please please please watch how awesome this is. i'm nearly 28 and I\nabsolutely loved it.\n"},
{"review": "\nHaving the opportunity to view this film twice really helped me get a\nperspective of the film that many may not have right now. This film is\nnot FROZEN... it is not filled with songs or magical snowmen.<br><br>But this film has something else, it has family, friends, action ,\ndrama, and most of all a big robot named Baymax who will examine your\nfunny bone and sense of humor . The film shows what kind of magic\nDisney can do with super hero's . The story is fast paced for the most\npart and the laughs and entertainment are high flying, that is if you\nlike heights , but if you don't its OK because this movie knows how to\nget down also. <br><br>The characters work well with each other, kinda like the scooby doo\ncrowd but twist that with a bit of incredibles and you have a fun\nfilled, action packed movie that will delight boys and girls of all\nages and keep parents happy that they took their child to see this. I\nknow my family and I enjoyed it twice and will be back for multiple\nviewings.\n"},
{"review": "\nDisney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me. Big Hero 6 is\none of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen. This\nfilm is fun, clever, imaginative, and filled with spectacle. While the\nfilm is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's\nplot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very\nenjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents. <br><br>Big Hero 6 is not only brings out the charm with heart-filling\ncharacters and comic relief but has some of the most dazzling CGI I\nhave seen in a Disney movie. The animators did a fantastic job on the\ncharacter models and the environment was nice looking. My favorite\ncharacter would probably be Baymax. What's not to like about a funny,\ninflatable robot who cracks funny one-liners,has the power to heal, and\nassists Hiro (main character) on his quest to defeat an evil scientist? <br><br>I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. I recommend this movie\nto all parents and children. Big Hero is a family thrill ride!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nContains spoilers, pass this review if you don't want to see any\nspoilers, such as end scenes and more.<br><br>I actually wasn't planning to watch this particular movie, until my\nfriends told me it was a good movie and that I should watch it.<br><br>I decided to try it and see how it goes. I instantly fell in love with\nBaymax. He's huggable and simply adorable. Along with that, he's a\nHEALTHCARE companion! It was certainly a HILARIOUS movie, and I enjoyed\nevery last bit of it.<br><br>I love how that Hiro, originally a boy who was interested only in bot\nfights, decides to do something big- starting with joining the nerd\nlab. There. he meets people like Wasabi, Fred, Go-Go, and more. <br><br>This movie also played with your emotions. And no, not just a little\nbit, but a lot. Disney seriously did a good job doing that. This movie\nwas one of those that actually almost made me cry. Near the end, Baymax\nhad supposedly \"died\" and that made me very emotional. I was so happy\nthat at the end, Hiro managed to make another Baymax using the chip the\noriginal Baymax had left behind. <br><br>All I have to say is that this movie is definitely one worth watching,\nespecially if you like humorous animated films.\n"},
{"review": "\nBig Hero 6 [2014] is the Disney 3-D animated comedy action film that\ncenters on Hiro Hamada, a 14-year old robotics prodigy, Baymax (an\ninflatable health companion robot) and an unlikely team of superheros. <br><br>5/5 graphics. Big Hero 6 transports viewers into a new visual realm and\nrelatively individual style (besides its anime resemblance). The story\nis set in the futuristic city of 'San Fransokyo'. A little of Tokyo and\nSan Francisco in one place. This explains the amalgamation of both\nJapanese and American components within the story and setting. It\nshould be noted that Big Hero 6 is not a wholly original idea, and the\nanimation is inspired by the Marvel comic by the very same name. <br><br>Baymax. Voiced by Scott Adsit, this lovable robot is animated to appear\nsoft, cuddly and adorable, credit goes to the graphics and writing team\non this one. Hiro's close friendship with Baymax is a highlight. Baymax\ncan hold his own on the screen alone too, just strolling through the\ncity streets, caring for others health and well-being. So yeah, he's\ncute and he knows it. <br><br>Expect to have a couple of teary moments. I won't describe or skim\nthrough details, out of utmost respect for those who haven't had a\nchance to see it yet. Since more serious topics aren't the usual in\nchildren targeted animation films, it's a nice change of pace. <br><br>Fantastic message for the young'uns. The main character Hiro (voiced by\nRyan Potter) and the rest of the superheros team study robotics at the\nlocal university (including T.J. Miller from Silicon Valley and Damon\nWayans Jr from New Girl). Reach your potential, practice non-violence\nand exercise sacrifice. That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are\nmore spoiler-worthy ones that will be omitted from this review\nentirely. By the way, it's not 'preachy' in the slightest.\n"},
{"review": "\nI have seen this animated film a number of times now, and have not\ngrown to become sick of it. I love the plot, the characters (especially\nmy favorite, GoGo) and am so thrilled that this film won an Oscar for\nBest Animated Film 2015. The only downside is that my favorite male\ncharacter, Tadashi, dies, but I understand why the writers included\nthis in the plot, for it had a huge impact on the film and brought\ngreat reflection to - especially - Hiro Hamada. The idea that the\noverall 'hero' is a non-threatening vinyl 'marshmallow' brings further\ninterest to the film, for he ends up saving just about all of the\nprotagonists lives, not to mention he is a very appropriate character\nfor all audiences, as well is the film entirely. All in all, I rated\nthis film 10 out of 10 stars for its excellence, in my opinion, and\nlook forward to any future works that will come out of this film!\n"},
{"review": "\nAn amazing Disney movie.Maybe the best one I ever watched. I have to be\nhonest.The best Disney movie since well, maybe 'The iron giant' or\nperhaps any other great cartoon. Ignore the haters. Believe me, the\nhaters are dumb. Because it's an action packed, funny, and emotional\nstory with a great plot that you will probably enjoy with your family.\nIt may seem cheesy at times. But you may not walk away unsatisfied.\nReally realistic animation, and amazing voice acting. Is it for only\nfor children? Nope, I don't think so. I watched this with my younger\nbrother, and we both enjoyed it equally. If you love to watch cartoons,\nand if you enjoy movies with great plots, and if you want to enjoy a\nhearty laugh ... This is a great bet. Believe me ... This is an amazing\nmovie, that you'll enjoy with your family and friends.\n"},
{"review": "\nWhere do I begin? Big hero Six is one of the best movies I've seen all\nyear. In one of my previous reviews, I used the term over and over\nagain that Disney has always done what it's done and should stick to\nthat. And this movie has! Running Disney themes have this movie that\ngets me very happy with Disney. This movie as I said in my previous\nreview brings us back from the god awful frozen. Very original and I'll\nbring this back from any any old tales or fairy tales, big hero six\ntells the tale of a young man's struggle to find the men who killed his\nbrother.With great action scenes good moral values and enough strength\nand motivation in its stride it brings me back to good Faith with\nDisney. Constant Disney clich\u00e9s that always want to make me watch this\nmovie over and over again , with a side of no backtracking and no\nunnecessary characters brings us to believe that Disney's got it back\nagain. This movies originality, good writing, and overall good happy\nfeeling, got me believing that Disney can move on from its mistakes.\nDisney has shown that it can make a good movie again by showing that\nyou don't need a musical and ridiculous characters to get little kids\nup and happy to buy your merchandise. This movie spoke to a wide\nvariety of people and not just easily fooled little kids. This movie\nmust've been a stowaway on the crap boat that was frozen and\nmaleficent.This movie is a rare occasion of well done combinations of\ndifferent elements (superheroes, Disney clich\u00e9s, etc). If you lost your\nmoney to frozen watch this movie so you metaphorically won't waste it.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Big Hero 6\" is a movie that shows the best of both Disney and Marvel.\nIt's funny, has exciting action scenes and has enjoyable characters.<br><br>Baymax (Scott Adsit), the inflatable huggable healthcare companion for\nHiro (Ryan Potter) was, for me, the best part of the movie. Baymax\nbrings laughs in almost every scene he is in, has a lot of action\nscenes and you end up loving him. Hiro is the most developed of the\nhuman characters (he is funny, his actions, however rash and dangerous,\nare understandable and he grows and learns from his mistakes) and he\nalong with Baymax makes the movie great. Although the other humans are\nall fun in their own way, I wish we got to know more about them.<br><br>The villain in this movie is good as well. Just goes about his job\ndoing evil stuff in an evil manner and is threatening throughout.<br><br>My only issue was with the ending which unfortunately went as\npredicted. However, this was still a very fun movie which did go places\n(dark intense places) I did not expect and improved the movie for me.\nBig Hero 6 entertained me a lot and will be fun for the entire family.\n"},
{"review": "\nBig Hero 6 is another movie based on Marvel source material but isn't\nlike others recently released.. this one is also a Disney animated\nfeature. How to train your dragon 2 was previously my favourite\nanimated film of the year.. that was until i saw this gem.<br><br>The story follows a smart kid named Hiro who is suffering from kid\ndepression after his brother is killed in a huge fire. This is where he\nmeets Baymax, the star of the film and possibly my favourite Disney\ncharacter since Olaf the snowman. Baymax is a big lovable idiot-type\nrobot who was built to provide healthcare for humans. Hiro sees Baymax\nas a chance to get revenge on his brother's killer and with him and his\nnew- found friends they embark on a journey to get justice.<br><br>Some of the film's best scenes come from Hiro's attempts to turn Baymax\ninto a badass fighting machine. This results in hilarious moments\nbecause we still have our big lovable idiot.. but now he has awesome\nsuperpowers, and i must say this kept me thoroughly entertained. The\nother characters were also awesome and each had their own personality\ntraits but at the end we are left with the relationship between Hiro\nand Baymax, although definitely not a bad thing because as an audience\nwe can never have enough Baymax.<br><br>I did feel that this film suffered from what Guardians of the Galaxy\nalso suffered with which is that the villain was underdeveloped,\nalthough unlike Ronan the villain in this film (no spoilers) did have a\nfleshed out plan and was quite a surprise twist. In the end I came out\nof Big Hero 6 feeling satisfied and entertained, featuring the humour\nof Marvel and the heart of Disney, this one is well worth a watch for\npeople of all ages and if you don't want your own personal Baymax by\nthe end then something must be wrong with you!\n"},
{"review": "\nHiro is a teen genius who seems to waste his time until his brother\nsets him on a right track.

Some scenes might be\nupsetting to younger viewers, but it is perfect for all ages.<br><br>My issues:<br><br>1. One of the characters sounds stereotypical. 2.

{"review": "\nMy family got tickets to an early showing. The movie was excellent. The\natmosphere was refreshingly different, the characters fleshed out, the\nplot touching, and the humor was rich and consistent . I would\nrecommend this one to anyone, and especially to couples and families\nwith children.Big Hero 6 really blew me away, I expected it to be good\nsince Disney is having another animation renaissance but once the\ncredits began to roll all I could do was wish it was longer. This movie\nhas something for everyone, comedy, action, some despair. In fact,\nsurprisingly the only thing missing was romance, which is fine with me.\nIf you love superheroes, robots, and animated films, I think you've\nfound your holy grail.\n"},
{"review": "\nBig Hero 6 is now literally my new favorite of all time! It is the most\nawesome movie in the entire world. I can't wait for the sequel, if\nthere is not a sequel I will die (not literally, just an expression).\nMy favorite part is the immortals scene where they all get suited up\ninto super heroes. I'm not going to say any spoilers, because some\npeople haven't seen it yet, like some of the girls at my school. My\nfavorite character is Hiro, its not just because he is smart and nerdy,\nbut the guy who plays him (Ryan Potter) is really cute. If there is a\nnext movie I think that, Hiro should fall in love and somebody kidnaps\nBaymax to make it more interesting. Big Hero 6 is amazing and I can't\nwait for the sequel.\n"},
{"review": "\nI popped along to the most anticipated movie of my Babes Inflatables.\nBig Hero 6. The film surrounds an Inflatbles that sets about saving the\na town.

{"review": "\nThis movie made me laugh and cry. I love the character Bay Max so much.\nEven though he was a robot, I felt he had a true heart. The fact that\nthey made him look like a huge marshmallow was genius. So many people\nwill be able to relate to his character just in that sense alone. The\nstoryline was done so well and captured the hearts of both kids and\nadults. Throwing in problems and finding solutions to the problems was\nonce again reiterated here. My mom and her friends even enjoyed the\nplot. The fact that there was an incredible invention developed in this\nstory gives all those inventors out there a push to go forward with\ntheir ideas. The future of technology is here and the bots are not too\nfar away from becoming a reality. Another great job by Disney!\n"},
{"review": "\nBig Hero 6 is hands down one of the best animated films I've ever seen\nand maybe the best non-Pixar film since The Lion King. The realism in\nthe animation, while not losing the charm associated with the genre, is\nstunning, the humanity and emotion in the film is superior to most live\naction films you'll see, and the story is fresh and entertaining. It\ncombines humor with sadness with action to make for an exciting viewing\nexperience. They also make you absolutely love Baymax, the big, white,\npuffy looking marsh mellow robot in all the advertisements. Overall,\nthis movie is suitable for people of all ages, genders, cultural\nbackgrounds, etc. Jump into San Fransokyo and get ready for a great\nfilm.\n"},

We laughed, we cried and we were amazed. <br><br>First of all: the animations are absolutely amazing in this movie!\nEvery hair, every detail, water, fire, you name it; I caught myself\nwondering at times how they made everything look so natural!<br><br>Then the plot; though the overall storyline is not that original, the\nway they built the characters around it and still gave the story it's\nown unique personality is brilliant. This was one of those movies that\nI didn't want to end just because it was so fantastic.<br><br>One of the most important reasons I loved this movie so much is the\nhumor in it. Especially the way Baymax learns and still tries to remain\ntrue to his original programming had me to tears (from laughing)\nseveral times. And not just me; the entire (adults only) cinema was\nbursting out into laughter!<br><br>Whether you go with kids or not; I guarantee you will have a great time\nseeing this movie.

{"review": "\nI have been a lifelong Disney fan, and make a habit to see any new\nreleases from Disney. After hearing many positive things about Big Hero\n6, I was eager to see it.

This movie proved to be an exception.<br><br>I found all of the characters in this movie to be wonderful and\nwell-developed, even the supporting characters.

Only Disney could\ncause you to feel attached to a robot, and they hit that nail on the\nhead.<br><br>The storyline is very unique and original, even though it is loosely\nbased off of the \"Big Hero 6\" comic from Marvel. The many plot twists\nwill leave you wondering what is yet to come. In addition, this movie\nhighlights the struggles of overcoming grief from the loss of a loved\none. As this is something that many viewers have experienced, you will\nprobably find yourself feeling emotional and will be able to relate to\nthe feelings of most of the characters (especially Hiro).<br><br>Big Hero 6 brings us back to the magic that many recent Disney films\nhave been lacking. This movie is definitely not just for little kids.\nI'm 19 years old and loved this movie, and my parents AND grandparents\ngreatly enjoyed this movie as well.

{"review": "\nBig Hero 6 is another in a line of many successful Disney animated\nmovies. And rightly so, might I add.

The story is action-packed comedy with dramatic elements\nto it and, as such, is appropriate for all ages. If you love Marvel\nmovies, you will most definitely like this one as well.

{"review": "\nso i originally didn't care for this film. a waster of time, irrelevant\nto both Disney and marvels big plans. i assumed it would end up like\ndaredevil or black cauldron, best forgotten, bow was i wrong. this film\ncombines the amazing animation, writing and greatness of recent Disney\nlike frozen and tangled, with the great plots of marvel. it nearly had\nme in tears at times, because there is so much emotion in this film,\nand had me laughing uncontrollably at others. the group is full of\npersonalities that are lovable and great. baymax is the true highlight\nof the film, but hiro and tadashi are incredibly stong and great\ncharacters. wasabi is always there for the comic relief and gogo is\nbad-ass. but they all become great as serious characters. and you have\nto love how honey lemon says \"hiro\" obviously, there are some issues.\nno film is without sin. it is predictable, clich\u00e9 and some of fred's\nlies are just too stupid for words. but they aren't the points that you\nwill remember. this film is definitely worth a watch and i suggest to\nto EVERYONE\n"},

Through the\nyears technology have been a theme Disney is developing more and more.\nIt is so good watching more Disney film talking about science, even\nthough is fictional.

Additionally, the film\nhad a slew of interesting and diverse characters and all of them were\nperformed amazingly well by a cast of very talented actors.

{"review": "\n3 February 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Big\nHero 6. With an Executive Producer like John Lasseter, whose name can\nbe found on most of the well known animated films from, Toy Story, and\nCars to the mighty success that is Frozen, you just know this is going\nto be another great. Great it was. These days it seems if you can find\na good story you can make an amazing animation. Set in the futuristic\nyet oddly homely city of San Frantokyo, this is the story of Hiro, a\nbrilliant 14 year old who is devastated after the death of his brother.\nTogether with Baymax a health robot created by his brother, Hiro\ndiscovers dark deeds afoot and he uses his exceptional mind and some\ngood friends to help save the day. The modern animation never ceases to\namaze me how it can stir as much emotion as an live action feature.\nTake the opening 15 minutes of Up for example, if that doesn't make you\nreach for a hanky then there is no heart in you. This film is the same,\nyou feel sorrow and it makes you laugh. I was advised to sit through\nthe credits until the very end to see an extra, and in doing so I\nlearned a flew things.....the amount of people needed to produce an\nanimation is just as many as a live film, there is even an animator in\ncharge of crowd scenes, and the sound was managed by Skywalker Sound\nout of Marin County California. Oh and the extra I was telling you\nabout......let's just say......roll on the sequel.\n"},

I think most people loved Baymax, judging from all the\nlaughs at the cinema. :)<br><br>Overall, I would definitely go see big hero 6 again. The action had me\non the edge of my seat and the plot twists were great. However, I wish\nDan and Phil's characters could have had more screen time, but\nnonetheless their parts were enjoyable.

Is it too hard\nto understand? And please, stop comparing movies, for lord Jesus.\nBaymax is one of those characters who can basically do no wrong. Every\nsequence he's part of is automatically funnier just because he's on\nscreen. A big, gorgeous, consistently funny and touching animated\nadventure. And what i love the most about it was that it celebrates\nnerd culture. And not merely the pop-culture- obsessed version (comic\nbooks) but the let's-invent- something-cool kind. To me, this kind of\nfilms makes me want to work in this business of creation and\nentertaining, highlighting universal values and dreams. Personally I\nhave to say that this is very inspiring and motivating, it reminds me a\nlot of my little brother who is a genius tech lover I am separated from\nhim but watching this, kind of make me feel him closer. Now I am\nfeeling better after watching this movie. It just worth it, and I give\na 10 to 10, it is going straight forward to my top 10 of my Disney\nfavorites movies of all the time.

As a fellow\nnerd this brought great joy in my life.

Also, Hiro shows you to never give up, no\nmatter what happens along the way. Just stay positive and keep your\nfriends close to help you.

{"review": "\nOkay, let's first start with the pros. This movie successfully\nshowcased how good the animation 3D technology can be. My friends and I\nquite enjoyed its overall quality. Also this movie has pretty much\ninnovative elements in it, with some big high tech creations. Overall,\nit's a light hearted movie. I'm sure almost everyone can find it\namusing. It is not perfect of course. First, seriously, all big hero\nmovies have to start with a family tragedy? I understand revenge is an\nemotional treat and good for plot, but this seems to be forcing the sad\nparts in and I don't like that idea of big heroes all have to suffer\nfrom family loss. Apart from that, some jokes are kinda stiff. The big\nmarshmallow bear's blalalala is pretty lame on my side. It certainly\nhas good branding effect tho. I see big ad boards everywhere including\nthe bus station at Zhongguancun, Beijing. In a nutshell, it's amusing,\nsort of funny, nice animation with fairly good character settings.

Another thing I like in this\nmovie is that it can mix our emotions. There are scenes that are fun,\nalso there are sad scenes. I thought Baymax was really going to be\nstuck inside the portal but later on we learn that his \"memory card\" is\non Baymax's rocket arm. That scene made me happy at the end of the\nmovie. And also, the funniest scene is the end credits scene where Fred\nsees his dad which surprisingly, is Stan Lee.

I\nthink this movie is gonna help a lot of people.

{"review": "\nOne of the best animation movies in the past couple of years. Gets hold\nof its audience right from the beginning and doesn't lose grip until\nthe credits.

The fast\npaced screenplay and a very well written script around robotics keep\nyour heels dug. May not be as good a treat for adults but will not be\nreprimanded by them either. For kids, it's got everything to keep them\nbubbling throughout the movie. From its characters to the well executed\naction sequences to its superb background score the movie is a delight\nto watch. All the ingredients of a \"BOX OFFICE HIT\" animation movie are\npretty palpable. The ever evolving protagonist of the movie Baymax who\nsenses pain around and activates, determined to go beyond limits to\ntreat its patients (Hiro most of the times,) receives blows, puts\nitself through any challenge and rises again.

Although there is slightly obviousness about the\nplot, but Big Hero 6 was worth to watch it again and again just to feel\nthose emotions.

I even have read a few\ncritics about the title.<br><br>Moreover, some reviewers were so lazy to watch it twice or third, they\nhave reached a conclusion that the villain has created the fire. There\nis not a clue of that.

{"review": "\nIt is obvious that Big Hero 6 was the best animation film of 2014.I\nalways appreciate those movies which motivates us and especially\nchildren towards science and Big Hero 6 is a awesome example of\nthat.This movie movie was full of fun and show us the importance of\nfamily,friends and how to clam down when we lost our loved ones.when it\ncomes to characters i must say Baymax is truly a masterpiece,every\nchildren and people of all age surely will love this character because\nof his loving and HUGGING personality.The special bond between Baymax\nand Hiro was incredible and that made this movie my favorite next to\nHow to train your dragon.Big Hero 6 is that kind of movie that make us\nbelieve that i can be super hero and that differ it from other\nsuperhero movie.And last of all when it comes to villain,Big Hero 6\nmovie did an outstanding job because there was quiet a good story\nbehind his evilness.the graphic and sound quality was truly marvelous.\n"},
{"review": "\nI don't normally write reviews, however after reading some other\nreviews on here I felt that it may have been misinterpreted. Whilst it\nis a kids film, which is obvious in the animation and relatively simple\ncharacters, Big Hero 6 is so much more. Disney has attempted many new\nthings which in my opinion has invigorated the brand and widened the\naudience. The obvious one being the use of a Marvel Comic and superhero\ntheme. This allowed for the movie to be much deeper than a typical\nDisney movie as it was a metaphor for loss and the seven stages of\ngrief. For example, the superheroes convey the fight that Hiro needs to\nhave within him in order to overcome such tragedy. The anger he feels\ntowards Callaghan conveys the betrayal one often feels after\nexperiencing a loss and how they may lash out, isolating themselves and\nperhaps hurting loved ones. This is seen in his treatment of the four\nfriends and Baymex when he removes the memory card and tells him to\ndestroy. In the end he eventually manages to move on and accepts his\nbrothers death. This theme is also explored through Callaghan.\nTherefore I believe that this is as much an adults film (or perhaps\nmore) as once you explore it beneath the surface there is an alternate\nmeaning.\n"},

Removing the serious parts from the comic\nbook, Big Hero 6 by Walt Disney is a bliss for those who ended up\nloving similar movies, for example, Kung Fu Panda, The Incredibles etc.\nThey have changed the story a lot which makes it way too different than\nthe comic.<br><br>Other than that, what I loved about the movie is how, throughout the\nmovie, Hiro, the protagonist learns of responsibilities and to come\nover his pain.<br><br>They have done a great job on Baymax, who, in the comic was a \"monster\"\n(seriously)? At some point, the movie seems like it is lacking the fun\nbut that's just for 10-20 minutes and I am very sure of the fact that\nmost of the viewers will end up loving Baymax for his behavior and way\nof speaking.<br><br>This is not some another movie like Planes but a whole new experience\nfrom Disney which blends comedy and action nicely along with a sense of\nresponsibility.\n"},

But the\nstory being from Disney, did have moments of it being 'too easy' as\nwell as a few stock characters but it wasn't such a big deal. The story\nwas told well, and wasn't cheesy or boring at all. The freshness of the\nvoices and the animation really put this film together.<br><br>The connection between the voices and animation really showed on screen\nthe chemistry between the characters, and this worked to gain the\nsympathy of the viewer's at certain scenes. I thought that was well\ndone, the characters were developed well in relation to each other. And\nI know I keep saying this, but I just really like the animation, and\nthe effects. Baymax is so cute, and the other character's have a kind\nof Asian feel to them. It's also quite cool how the animated characters\nalmost always resemble the actors voicing them (I guess this is\nintentional).<br><br>However, watching the trailer again, I notice that they miss some of\nthe scenes out.

Having a great cast of\ncharacters who had their wonderful personalities and visible flaws (as\nall people do, this is personal flaws, not flaws in the actual\ncharacters), it felt like I was watching a mini Tony Stark trying to\nbuild his way to solve all of his problems. The movie was a perfect\nlength, having a quick introduction into who everyone was (with no 20\nminute backstory *jumps up and flails in excitement*), and then it got\nto the problem. It was on point and direct all the way through, just as\nwell as having fun along the way.<br><br>I only had one, very very VERY slight problem with this movie. It was\nhow Hiro (the main character) didn't come across as to who the supposed\nvillain was, even though he could build an army of neuro-transmitted\nmicrobots in a garage. And how quickly the scene seemed when he came up\nwith the solution to fight the problem with his friends. Very very\nslight personal issues and nothing that reflected in on my review of\nthis film.<br><br>Big hero six is a clever, cute, funny, and VERY creative take on the\nmodern day superhero film. The movie took itself to great heights and\nearn its spot among some of my favorite movies of all time. This was a\nmovie made for anyone of any age, and that is a hard thing to pull off.\nFinal note, stay until after the credits. (It's a Marvel movie.)<br><br>Final Review Score: 10/10\n"},
{"review": "\nOh Yes. I did a *Insert Name Here* Is Love and Life meme. Because I am\nseriously obsessed with this movie! I haven't been in love with a movie\nthis badly since The Lego Movie! Even though Big Hero 6 does not have\nlots of Political Messages as The Lego Movie, It Still is a fantastic\nfilm that should be more loved. I really want to support this film in\nits fullest.<br><br>PLOT: Hiro is a Bot Fighter. But after Tadashi convinces him to go to\nUniversity where he sees potential, things go bad as 1. Tadashi Dies in\nan explosion. 2. His Micro Bots that he has made is found to be stolen\nand 3. A masked man is using the micro bots for his own good. So now\nits up to Hiro and his friends, The Big Hero 6 to set off to save San\nFransokyo!<br><br>From what I looked up, the movie is very different from the comics\nwhich I will have to look into more and find some to read. But for what\nthe movie is... WOW. San Fransokyo looks amazing in its opening shots\nof the movie. It looks incredible! As for the characters, MY GOD I LOVE\nTHEM ALL. Baymax is hilarious and is the center messenger of the film.\nHiro is really cool and so are all of his friends. <br><br>The whole film is filled with so much heart. An important movie because\nof its commentary on technology and if we are really ready to step into\nthe future and how it should be used properly. <br><br>By the end of the movie, I was wanting more and more! I actually wrote\na fan letter to John Lasseter who was the executive producer of the\nfilm to make a sequel or better yet, a TV series because there is so\nmuch you can do with these characters!<br><br>Big Hero 6 I think is going to be one of the all time classic animated\nfilms. I hope more people will support this movie because I would love\nto see every character again.<br><br>97/100 A\n"},
{"review": "\nIs Pixar even capable of making a bad film? I ask that honestly. Every\nfilm I have seen produced by them I either loved or at least respected\nthe precision of quality they give every production they do.<br><br>Big Hero 6 is certainly no exception.<br><br>The story of Hiro, a little boy who is into fighting bots who\nbefriends, what was originally designed to be a health care robot, is\ntouching, delightful and fun.<br><br>Hiro puts together a team of his science friends who each have their\nown special talents which he catapults into super hero \"powers\"\nincluding \"upgrading\" Baymax, the health care bot.<br><br>Together they try to figure out a whodunit and save the day.<br><br>Hero, as well as his team, learn a lot of valuable lessons throughout\ntheir adventure and if you don't come away from this movie wanting your\nown Baymax I would be surprised.<br><br>Although there are some darker moments it is nothing that would\npreclude little kids from enjoying the movie as the dark moments are\nnot that bad and the movie as a whole is a family friendly experience.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was reading some of the user reviews on here and don't understand\nsome of the negativity...so wanted to share my perspective on the film.<br><br>For me, the Good Guy vs. Bad Guy \"action\" sequences aren't the main\nstory line of the film. Rather, it seemed it was about loss and the\nstruggle of living up to the lost person's expectations while still\ntrying to hold on to the memories of that person and not let that loss\nruin those memories. In so many ways, I was very pleased that this\nmovie wasn't overly violent (Lego Movie) or princess focused but\ninstead had this more heart focused goal of loyalty and remembrance\ninstead.<br><br>Whereas some of the lines may have been cheesy or clich\u00e9 and many of\nthe supporting heroes weren't developed, I found that was fine because\nthere was much more focus put into the main story line and it made it\nlighter on delivery. I also found the story was fresh and characters\nunderstandable - even the villain. <br><br>In summary, this movie was fun...with a good blend of serious. Highly\nrecommended.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie, if you haven't already seen it is a must see in my opinion.\nI grew up watching Disney movies and i recently haven't watched any of\nthe new titles they have been releasing. But i sat down and watched\nthis just because nothing else was playing and i was not disappointed.\nIt was really nice to see the Japanese concept i feel like they haven't\ntouched on the Asian community since Mulan. I would love to give this\nmovie a 10 however compared to the lion king and Aladdin it takes the\nsilver. The only thing its missing to be a truly great animated Disney\nflick is of course the musical numbers. Other than that this movie is\ndefiantly one i must add to my collection worth every penny and time.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis animated film tells the story of a technology geek who lost his\nbrother in a fire in a technological convention. He finds out that his\ninvention called microbots got stolen by a masked man, and he sets out\nto save the world with his friends.<br><br>\"Big Hero 6\" has fun and really cute characters. Everyone is very\nadorable, especially the marshmallow robot who has unconventional\nsuperpowers. The best thing about this film is that the superpowers are\ntechnologically relatively sound, at least in the not too distant\nfuture, making the heroes and the plot look a little more realistic\nwithin the fantastical dream. I also like the mash up between San\nFrancisco and Tokyo, making the city look like San Francisco with a\nJapanese twist. I enjoyed the film throughout, and there is not a\nmoment of boredom.\n"},
{"review": "\nJust watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen\nthis twice before and liked it very much. So did I after viewing\nthis-what an awesome display of a bunch of science nerds becoming\nsuperheros after some tragic occurrences that happen early on. Baymax,\na rubber robot, is also on hand to help his human counterparts to set\nthings right. I didn't watch this in 3-D so when certain scenes came\non, I winced a little in not being able to do so. Still, this was such\na great mix of humor and action and had very likable characters, I\nmostly didn't care, one way or another! I mean, this was quite an\nawesome experience, I was simply just glad for the ride! So on that\nnote, Big Hero 6 is highly recommended. Oh, and don't miss the\nafter-ending credits sequence, it's a great hoot!\n"},
{"review": "\nI just came out of the cinema and I had to wipe my tears from my face.\nTears of laughter and emotions. I know this is not by Pixar but for\nonce I think Disney reached Pixar levels of amazing. Best Disney for me\nsince Monsters Inc. (if you count it as a Disney). The kids in the\ntheater loved it too of course but it works just as good and even\nbetter for adults. I thought Frozen was good but not 'amazing' like\nsome thought. This however surpasses Frozen on every level... except\nthere's no singing of course. But the movie is way funnier and will\nalso make you really sad at some points. Amazing movie, can't stress it\nenough. I just hope they don't pump too mich sequels out of this...\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is has Academy Award nomination written all over. <br><br>The characters are excellent and fun. Hiro is a great character and the\nwriting for his character is very consistent as a genius and going\nthrough the reality of a teenager. Baymax is a well written character\nand has most of the character development with Hiro being close second.\nThe chemistry and relations between Baymas and Hiro is great. One of\nthe girls pronounces Hiro's name right in Japanese pronunciation. <br><br>The acting is pretty good and speaking off I found TJ Miller annoying\nin Transformers but not here. He is pretty good being the comic book\njock and does not outstay his welcome. Speaking off this is a Marvel\nmovie so there is a Stan Lee cameo in the post-credits. <br><br>The center of this movie is not about being a Marvel superhero movie,\nit is about a boy and a robot getting justice for the death of his\nolder brother and then it becomes a superhero movie so it works getting\nto that point very well. <br><br>The jokes hit very well more than they miss. Some of the jokes got me\nlaughing. <br><br>The animation for this movie is pretty good and I find them very\ncolorful. <br><br>The story is pretty good and intriguing, and they have the tragedy at\nthe beginning when Hiro's brother is killed in an explosion. <br><br>I say the film's biggest weakness that it is predictable. There is a\ntwist on who is the main villain and it is easy to figure out on who is\nthe main villain. So it's predictiablity what hold this film back for a\nperfect score. <br><br>If you hadn't see it yet, then go see it because it is really great. I\nsay this film is better than Mockingjay and Interstellar.\n"},
{"review": "\nI know for a fact that it will be nominated for Best Animation at the\n2015 Oscars, no doubt. After the princess high I am sure everyone was\non after Frozen, it was nice to see a Disney film with a male lead and\nabout hi tech/engineering (Obviously not the first, I just enjoyed\nseeing this). This film had action, enough emotion to make you want to\ncry, and some seriously funny lines that had most of the adults in the\naudience laughing. Disney has really found it's way of really being for\nall ages, I went with my boyfriend and there was just as many older\ncouples as families. This movie was not just a film to entertain, it\nwas a push for kids to create, Who didn't want to build their own\nBaymax after watching this?!\n"},
{"review": "\nI absolutely loved this movie! It had cute adorable scenes and it had\nsad scenes, as well as some action scenes. The animation was beautiful\nand the concept of the whole movie was interesting and different. I can\nhonestly say that this is my new favorite Disney movie. Frozen? Who\nneeds Frozen when we now have Big Hero 6! This movie was really just\nthe epitome of perfection and it is so perfect that you could watch it\nwith your family! This movie overall made me smile and keep that smile\nfor the rest of the day. A movie definitely worth watching even if\nyou're an adult or you don't particularly like watching animation. This\nmovie will warm your heart and make you want to be a hero all over\nagain.\n"},
{"review": "\nI cannot get over how adorably cute this movie is. The movie constantly\nhits all the right notes. It is adorable, quirky, witty and completely\nemotional at the same time. The love portrayed between a young boy and\nhis brother, a man and his daughter and of course a young boy and his\nrobot is amazing. <br><br>It definitely is in the frozen league and m certain there will be\ntremendous fan following for baymax. Now that I have seen it, I am not\nsurprised at all that it grossed way more than interstellar. Everyone\nneeds movies like big hero 6 that leaves you warm and fuzzy right to\nyour core. <br><br>I am satisfied with your care. - once you get familiar with this quote,\nif you cried when you did, rest assured, you are awesome.<br><br>Oh and btw, don't worry, the ending leaves you happy happy happy.!!!!!<br><br>P.s. It is probably the only Disney movie where the characters do not\nburst into a song. :p <br><br>Bottom line - must watch for humans of all ages..!!\n"},
{"review": "\nThe movie is beautiful in a way that only Disney can do it. The main\ncharacter is an wonderful kid, I love intelligent kids and this one has\na background not so good to tell what makes his story more likable. His\nbrother's robot is hilarious and so sweet, and his robots are\ncompletely amazing too! I cried many times during the movie. To me is\nan absolute must seen for animation movies fans. For kids movie will\npass a good message about the will of want know and have great\nachievements, maybe a boost for interest on robots and science.\nFurthermore, the typical message about friends: with friends is easy\npass by tough situations, they always help us and will be there for us.\nAn important one. In future I absolutely will show this movie to my own\nkids!\n"},

{"review": "\nI am not a huge fan of CGI films. Now I am not saying I dislike them,\nbut I do feel that sometimes there are too many and too many mediocre\ncomputer generated cartoons. However, I think that \"Big Hero 6\" is\ndefinitely a welcome film to the genre. Why? Because the film is\nabsolutely beautiful, as the graphics are just amazing. Additionally,\nwhile I also think there have been way too many superhero movies, this\none is different enough to make it worth seeing.<br><br>The film is about a brilliant young man named Hiro. Hiro, though\nincredibly bright when it comes to robotics, is directionless until his\nolder brother introduces him to his research facility at the local\nuniversity. To win a scholarship to the place, Hiro creates an amazing\nrobotic system--one so amazing that someone is willing to kill to get\nit. And, once they've stolen it, Hiro uses his brother's medical robot,\nBaymax, to help punish the baddie and restore justice and niceness to\nthe world.<br><br>While the film DOES feature the usual sort of finale (the weakest part\nof the film--though I do understand why it's there), so much of what\nleads up to it is nice. I liked the characters, the back story and the\nwriting. It's really very clever in places--such as their wonderful use\nof Stan Lee in his cameos since this one is so unusual AND he appears\ntwice in the film (so stay and watch ALL the film or you'll miss it).\nWell worth seeing.\n"},
{"review": "\nSure to be the mega-hit of the holidays, Disney's futuristic tale ticks\nall of the right boxes: it's funny, smart, charming and exhilarating.\nSet in San Fransokyo \u0096 a clever amalgamation of American and Oriental\nstyle \u0096 we follow mourning teen-genius Hiro (Ryan Potter) as he bonds\nwith his late brother's friends and scientific creation, Baymax. With\nan irresistibly huggable design, amusing voice (thanks to Scott Adsit)\nand delightful demeanour, Baymax provides the lion's share of laughs\nand, ultimately, is the star of the show. Not as memorable as the\ncuddly, inflatable robot, the humans are a mixed bag. Whilst lead\nprotagonist Hiro and his brother Tadashi (the sort of older sibling we\nall want, voiced by Daniel Henney) are likable and fleshed out, their\nragtag group of mates are cardboard cut-outs and the pair of scientists\nvying for Hiro's invention (awesomely conceived micro-bots) are clich\u00e9d\nand one-dimensional. But underdeveloped supporting players and it's\nsomewhat generic ending are minor gripes, as Big Hero 6 segues from\nelectrifying action sequences to hilarious comedic set-pieces, via the\noccasional touching moments, with absolute ease, resulting in a\nnon-stop joyride. A wonderful Christmas treat from the Mouse House\nthat'll be a smash with young'uns and, possibly even more, with their\nparents.\n"}
