{"review": "\nThe stand out feature of the Lego Movie for me would be the way the\nLego Universe was created. The movie paid great attention to detail\nmaking everything appear as it would made from Lego, including the\nwater and clouds, and the surfaces people walked on all had the circles\nsticking upwards a Lego piece would have. Combined with all the yellow\nfaces, and Lego part during building, I was convinced action took place\nin the Lego Universe.<br><br>A combination of adult and child friendly humour should entertain all,\nthe movie has done well to ensure audiences of all ages are catered to. <br><br>The voice cast were excellent, especially Liam Neeson's split\npersonality police officer, making the 2 personalities sound\ndistinctive, and giving his Bad Cop the usual Liam Neeson tough guy. <br><br>The plot is about resisting an over-controlling ruler, highlighted by\nthe name of the hero's \"resistance piece\". It is well thought through,\nwell written, and revealing at the right times. Full of surprises, The\nLego Movie won't let You see what's coming. Best animated film since\nWreck it Ralph! Please let there be sequels.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was the only adult who didn't bring kids to the theater and all I can\nsay is that I was leading the clapping when the credits rolled.<br><br>\"The Lego Movie\" was an awesome, super creative, and extremely\nsatisfying film for all ages- that is, if you have ever played with\nLegos. Even people that have never bought a Lego set will this enjoy\nthis awesomely humorous and in the end, heartfelt movie.<br><br>(Notice I am using the word awesome a lot, because one cannot stop\nsinging the \"Everything is awesome\" song played in the movie. Too\ncatchy!)<br><br>The creators did a wonderful job putting all the classic things about\nLegos and making a new movie packed with humor.<br><br>The voice actors were outstanding. You can tell they really enjoyed\ndoing the movie and put in a lot of effort. Liam Neeson was fantastic\nas the Good Cop/Bad Cop. But the most credit to the success of this\nmovie goes to Will Farrell who played the villain, President Business.\nHe gives such a great effort in this movie which allows you to laugh,\nsmile, and want more Lego awesomeness.<br><br>I give the Lego movie a big two thumbs up and is by far the best\npicture I've seen in a few months. Highly recommend this movie to all\nLego lovers who have a passion to build and create something awesome,\njust like the movie makers created this amazingly, AWESOME, film.\n"},
{"review": "\nThe Lego Movie is a winner on several levels. There is a good amount of\nclever gags and I was constantly bursting with laughter. I was\nsurprised by how it contained so many memorable cameos, pop icons and\nfilm references, providing a strong nostalgia factor to older viewers.\nThe playful approach towards movie clich\u00e9s made it a really enjoyable\nand refreshing watch. The animation is absolutely stunning and the\nblend of CGI with stop motion worked brilliantly. Everything can be\nattachable, making the vibe of each scenario feel very unique and\nunlike anything you've ever seen. The Lego Movie has plenty of heart\ntoo by the end of the journey and it's going to be really tough for\nanother animated film to surpass its inventiveness and charm.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is my first review. I never wrote a review because I felt other\nIMDb member had captured what I felt like saying. You may think it's a\nmistake to see this movie because it's just a \"toy\" movie. But that's\nwhat makes it so brilliant. There are so many well known characters\nthroughout the film, and it's rare to see such great character\ndevelopment.<br><br>Even though there are so many it's really the charming Emmet (Chris\nPratt) who steals the show. <br><br>It really was a LOT better than the previews made it seem. Charming\nfrom beginning to end, with a few surprises you won't expect. The less\nsaid, the better.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you watch the trailer and you think its just gonna be a fun\nstop-motion animated Lego movie, you were wrong. The Lego Movie is\nbeyond fun. its creative and it brings back a lot childhood memories.\nThe story was amazing, the jokes were hilarious, and they have great\nintention in details.<br><br>But, the most important thing, the movie remind us to be creative.\nBecause sometimes, As we grow up, in someway, we stop being creative\nand just follow the rules and instruction. For adults, this movie will\nbring back your childhood memories and how you used to play randomly\nwith those Lego. And for a kids, you'll just love this movie, and\ndefinitely makes you want to play with your own Lego.<br><br>totally worth watching movie! even your grandparents will enjoy this\nmovie! 9/10\n"},

It's\namazing to see how lego people in a world made by lego, live and\ninteract with each other. There were some funny moments for kids and\neven some moments for adults too. Overall it is a very enjoyable movie\nand it is sure to remind you of your childhood. I recommend it to\nanyone who has ever played with any form of lego whatsoever. You'd be\nsurprised to see how relevant this movie will feel. <br><br>I think all people from all ages can find something in this movie that\nwill warm their heart. A timeless classic for sure.\n"},

When I was a kid playing with Lego I\nnever thought to my self that they will make a film on it now that they\nhave all my Christmases have come at once. Cant wait for the special\nfeatures on blue ray. This movie will be up there with toy story 1 2\nand 3 , the lion king , frozen and wreck it Ralph. The power of good\nfilms are in Lego hands people are genius congrats to all the Oscars\nfor the road ahead\n"},
{"review": "\nI usually enjoy children's films more than my children (Shrek and Toy\nStory being two examples). This one didn't quite hit the mark with me.\nThere's enough to keep the children amused throughout and the graphics\nare what you would expect from today's CGI standards. However, the\nhumour doesn't sparkle like the titles I mentioned above, and the whole\nfilm had a claustrophobic feel to it, a bit like Tron Legacy. The\nending, though charming, was a little lame, I felt. I went to see it\nbased on the score given by previous viewers, but won't be bothered if\nI don't see it again. One other gripe - the continual playing of the\n'Everything Is Awesome' song became very irritating- even the children\ncommented on this.\n"},
{"review": "\nI go to see this movie with other four people, and neither of us like\nit. I was so disappointed, because the trailers make the movie seems\nlike a really funny, unexpected and unique adventure. So, when I came\nhome and know that have a 8.9 in IMDb is just make me feel worst.<br><br>In my case, the humor is not funny, is like they try so hard, the\naction scenes are to fast to really enjoy them and I found the plot no\ninteresting at all. And the worst was the characters, which aside of\nBatman, were too plastic, predictable and just boring for my taste.<br><br>To me, this is just a huge commercial from Lego, but that's just me.<br><br>People really like this movie, and that's great! I'm happy that people\ncan see thing in stuff that I don't, but personally, I found this movie\nalready very overrated.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie was so so SO overrated. The jokes were terrible and Emmett\nwas insanely annoying! I mean the first line was, \"He's coming. Cover\nyou butt.\" The moment I heard that line, I knew the movie was gonna go\ndownhill from there. And I was right! The jokes flew by so fast, they\nwent right over my head. But the ones I did get... weren't funny at\nall. Now I will admit I enjoyed the character Unikitty (I know, a\ncat/unicorn. Stay with me). She was pretty funny with the whole\nhappiness thing and she kept saying no about the negative stuff (it's\ncalled irony). Plus the ending got boring. Around the time the people\nappeared on screen, the line cues got slower and slower (and more\nboring). Most people have been saying that the ending sucked (it did),\nbut I like it because the movie finally ended. Anyway, this movie is\nbad! The only reason why I'm giving it a generous 5 is because the\nanimation actually was awesome. That was one of the few good things\nabout this movie. So unless you only pay attention to the animation and\nnot the story line, this is not for you.\n"},
{"review": "\nI'm the only person I know that didn't love this movie. After hearing\nall the rave reviews I had high expectations. I had several issues with\nthe film...<br><br>-The pacing in this film was very off putting for me. Frenetic start!\nCharacter development was weak and things happened very fast for the\nfirst 15-20 minutes. It sort of made my head hurt. Then things slowed\nway down and I found the movie to be pretty boring right until the end.<br><br>-The plot line, where a father is taking away his kids legos, kind of\nirked me and it was obvious from the start he was going to come around\nby the end of the movie. As a Dad, I also thought it had the potential\nto undermine my authority with my kid a little. <br><br>-The punch lines just weren't that funny. I chuckled a few times but\nthat was it, and all the best jokes were already in the trailers. <br><br>-Too much product placement. Lets be honest, the entire move is big ad\nfor Lego. But then they throw in all the other products, and it really\nmade the whole film feel like a giant \"get your parents to buy this!\"\ncommercial to kids. <br><br>So, there it is. My opinion on a very highly rated film that I just\ndidn't enjoy very much.\n"},
{"review": "\nI absolutely hated this movie. Having paid for my family around \u00a310\neach to watch what is basically an advert for Lego, I just feel\ncheated. I didn't find the cheeky nods and winks to other classic films\nfunny, I didn't find the script funny. It was too loud, too slow, too\n... rubbish for me to watch. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler or not\nbut I have no idea what the ending was about, the whole Will Ferrell\nthing with it's preachy lesson of adults forgetting the value of being\nable to be creative - complete tosh. My family felt the same by the\nway. No amount of reading the rave reviews with explanations can hide\nthe fact that this film simply does not live up to the hype.\n"},
{"review": "\nA fun film that made me a kid. Of course, I am already a proud kid.<br><br>Never since TOY STORY 3, I had so much fun in an animated film. Also,\nthis film made me nostalgic as I used play with Lego toys when I was a\nkid. So there are some personal things that are attached with this\nfilm, and indeed they drove me to the film more than the trailer of the\nfilm itself.<br><br>The film is a simple, the premise that an ordinary guy can become a\nhero, only if he believes in himself is well presented. It's not a film\nthat has epic conflict or great story. But it's charm lies in the\nwriting, the wit that is inevitably laughable. Most were laughing out\nloud in the theater, from my 4 year nephew to a 70 year grand uncle. <br><br>The animation is surely top notch, we have to consider that making a 3D\nfilm with real toys is really challenging, and that's where the\nanimation industry in Hollywood must be praised for. Their quality of\nanimation just keeps getting higher and higher and it's so wonderful\nfor the cinema world over. <br><br>The music plays a vital role is conveying that indeed \"everything is\nawesome\". Also, the well choreographed events and the detailing of the\nanimation is great. It's all colorful and pleasing to the eyes and the\n3D technology gets due justification in a few scenes too. <br><br>I am going with 4/5 and would love to catch it again at the theaters\nwith more kids around, I loved it and hopefully if you ever see it, the\nkid in you is revealed or you are helped a great deal by your own kids.\n"},

Used to be a genuine place to investigate and review movies.\nNow, we have to log in, verify ourselves as ourselves and type\nencrypted words to be \"accepted\".

{"review": "\nThe outer story is about a kid and his dad who doesn't understand play.\nAn inner story has tokens that elaborate on this, a story that is\nmostly flashiness. The animation is based on Lego and I am sure there\nis a large franchise in the works. <br><br>An inner, inner story is about an intrepid girl who doggedly searches\nfor the legendary special piece. She is a master builder and it is she\nthat repeatedly saves the day and pulls the hapless hero through the\nstory. This character is sadly drawn. She has identity issues, picks\nher men unwisely and is disappointed in not being the chosen one.<br><br>At the end of the movie, when all else is reconciled, her agency is\nremoved as she becomes 'the girlfriend.' That agency is insultingly\nreplaced by the boy's little sister. I think we need to see her again,\nand see her master her situation.\n"},

Deviating from the norm,\nthe 'hero' of the story (subject to personal opinion) was unaware and\nunprepared to fulfil his role and in actual fact, one of the main\nlessons to be derived from the film is that anyone has the ability to\nbe someone special as long as they believe in their own ability to do\nso.

All the characters are alive and downright hilarious...from\nBatman to Green Lantern and Kitty and Abe Lincoln. I can't give away\nthe plot, but it is clear the producers and directors also have an\naffinity with Legos. The underlying message comes across as fresh; a\nmessage everyone can relate to.

{"review": "\n\"The LEGO Movie\" is a children's film in the category of toys that come\nto life, and may interact with their owners. Such films include the H.\nC. Andersen \"Brave Tin Soldier\" segment from Fantasia 2000, accompanied\nby Shostakhovich's 2nd piano concerto, or Pixar's classic \"Toy Story.\"\nHow does \"LEGO\" stack up (pun intended) against \"Toy Story\"? I gave the\nlatter an 8/10, and I would say \"The LEGO Movie\" is at least 2 notches\ndown. 6/10.<br><br>Of course the best part is the LEGO landscapes. The director\nintermingles plenty of product lines, from Star Wars to Pirates to\nDuplo to Cityscape. It all would have been really impressive if it had\nbeen done with real blocks by stopped motion animation, like some of\nthe fan shorts. Alas, it's just CGI, but at least they stuck to LEGO\nbrick rules all the way through, as far as I could tell.<br><br>The story is humdrum: an evil and not-so-special LEGO figure wants to\nglue everything together with superglue. In the real world, dad wants\nto do the same with his big basement LEGO project, so his son can't\nmess it up. To the rescue comes an ordinary LEGO worker figure who\nshows that anyone can be \"special,\" and convinces the evil mastermind\nto stand down. A bit of pop culture reference is thrown in here or\nthere, a bit of satire now and then, but none of it rises above the\nlevel of a 14 year-old bionicle user who may be watching, never mind a\ngrizzled old moviegoer who wants to see something new.<br><br>So the movie is what it is: harmless, fluffy kid's fare, lacking the\ncharm of stop-motion animation LEGO shorts, with a \"theme song\" that\nruns out of melody and lyrics in about 10 seconds. It's sure to spawn\nsequels to please the 6-10 year old crowd. And it should, they could be\nwatching worse.<br><br>The biggest irony: the only novel idea in the film was the\ndouble-decker couch!\n"},

{"review": "\nThe movie felt like a LEGO commercial, but it was so obvious,\nespecially when showing the different worlds and themes, that it was\nfine, it just seemed like a satire of their own ads. <br><br>For me, the jokes were very good, we really see the traditional\n(super)heroes act differently than normally, because they are \"played\"\nby a kid, who puts his own thoughts in his LEGO toys. <br><br>What's most interesting is the idea that there's no absolute bad - at\nsome point it stops to be the idea of following the rules, use logic vs\ncreativity : when both are together, there is a transformation of the\nworld, of this LEGO world, that Gabriel Tarde would describe as an\nemergence of values. Something new, different, is created, because of\nthe confrontation of both entities. Unlike most movies, it's not a\nduality (bad vs good, tyranny vs rebellion) in which one wins against\nthe other, it is really a transformation. <br><br>So the next question we could ask is if they used this method to build\nthis movie : did they really, put the values of the producers (eg. :\nmake money), of the actors (e.g. : be well known), of the spectators\n(both kids and more grown-ups), etc. in confrontation to come with a\nfresh, new movie that would not have been created if, for example, the\nvalues of the producers dominated the others...

The animation called for a lot of\nimagination to recreate blockbuster action \"special effects\" by using\nonly Lego!<br><br># It is heart warming. The are truly naive animation sequences (you\nsmile to the ingenuity portrayed) and the originality of the master\nbuilders is, well, awesome. This is an ode to the imagination of a\nchild and the lost ability of adults to see with those dreamer eyes.\nYou will remind yourself of that time.<br><br># It is smart. It has tons of references to Lego history and pop\nculture. It has jokes to all. It portrays criticism to western way of\nliving, TV culture, capitalism... It makes you think. <br><br>#It is funny. Some jokes seem like they are made for you, because of\nthe multiple references to movies, characters, everyday life\nsituations.<br><br>I truly enjoyed this movie. It has all the elements right.

The big moral is that you should let your children create\ntheir own world through toys and how parents should give them the\nfreedom and material to do so. The story during the animated part is\nmeant to entertain and is about the fight between good and bad.<br><br>The only negative thing I can mention is that at a certain point the\nmovie changes location to the real world which kicks you out of the\nanimated world that kept you so close to the story... The whole movie\nwas about the fight between good and bad, freedom and brainwashing and\nin a sudden it's about a father that doesn't gives his child the\nfreedom to create an own dreamworld.

{"review": "\nThere hasn't been any movie, even in animation, which has the visual of\nThe Lego Movie. Having one of a kind trait that everyone can relate to\nis a significant edge. It assembles the visual of CGI for stop motion\nfeel, vigorous cast and truly entertaining script filled with pop\nculture references. The movie is as exciting as getting your first set\nof Lego.<br><br>Emmet (Chris Pratt) is a Lego construction man, the run-of-the-mill\nordinary one. He stumbles across a mysterious piece after his work day\nis over. What comes is the heroic journey where he gathers friend to\noverthrown the nasty antagonist. This simple premise is used with very\nsatirical tone, and also unexpectedly deep narrative. The movie doesn't\ndwell too seriously on already known formula, it administers them with\nunusually fresh variety. It delivers an underlying message that\nresonates not only to children, but also all ages.<br><br>Cast is simply wonderful. Everyone has their own distinguish\nover-the-top flair. The characters are representation of pop culture,\nfrom Batman, Morgan Freeman's prophetic Vitruvius to Liam Neeson's no\nnonsense Bad Cop. Glued by an amazingly witty script and lightning fast\npace, the movie tirelessly delivers spot-on jokes, crazy one-liner in\naddition to surprisingly tender moments. The humor is sharp as well as\ncynical, they churn out humorous banter in nearly every conversations.<br><br>Graphic is nicely done, nowadays film animations have their own\ndifferent lively styles. However, The Lego Movie utilizes familiarity\nof its brand to the audience. It's compelling to see the minute details\nthey put in, creative design such as the spaceship parts or the waves\nof ocean that imaginatively engaging, even if some looks simplistic.\nThese features also contribute naturally on its many inside jokes.<br><br>The Lego Movie embodies the spirit of the toy, it's fun, ageless and\noffers delightful experience.\n"},
{"review": "\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br><br>Everything in \"The Lego Movie\" is, indeed, awesome.<br><br>Awesome as in the sort of silly yet wily kid-appropriate PG-rated film.\nIn my opinion, this is the best performance by Will Ferrell that I've\nbeen waiting for ever since \"Elf\" came out more than a decade ago.<br><br>It is exceedingly cool that a major-studio family film refuses to\nsimply capitalize on merchandising spin-offs by offering an oppressive\n100-minute commercial. Instead, \"The Lego Movie\" manages to be a\nsmartly subversive satire about the drawbacks of conformity and\nfollowing the rules while celebrating the power of imagination and\nindividuality. It still might be a 100-minute commercial, but at least\nit's a highly entertaining and, most surprisingly, a thoughtful one\nwith in-jokes that snap, crackle and zoom by at warp speed.<br><br>I had no interest in seeing this film; however, all my friends that saw\nit said it was a great movie, and I decided to give it a watch. This is\nthe best film of the year and, as far as I'm concerned, the best film\nI've seen if a couple of years. It is also the most subversive,\npro-liberty film since (I kid you not) \"V for Vendetta\" with smart,\nwell-deserved swipes at the head of the government. Bring your adult\nfriends if you don't have children of your own.<br><br>It is a wonderful movie, I had the same reaction to it as I had seeing\n\"Shrek\" and \"Toy Story 3\". If you do not have your own child, now is\nthe time to offer to babysit a niece or nephew. It's nice to see that\nimagination can still show up and surprise you in the best way\npossible. It was way better than it needed to be, for a toy- based\nmovie. With a message at the end that should be seen by many parents.<br><br>Best movie of the year, so far.\n"},

{"review": "\nTHE LEGO MOVIE is a very entertaining, funny and, in the end, rather\npoignant film that will appeal to kids and adults. The story is about a\nnondescript, fit-in-with-the-crowd nobody named Emmett who accidentally\nhappens upon a mythical \"Piece of Resistance.\" Aided by the Master\nBuilders, he tries to stop the universe from being ruined by\nLord/President Business. Having only just watched this now, as it makes\nits way onto home video, I didn't watch it in theaters although I was\naware of the hype and positive reactions to it, both from critics and\naudiences. However, I must say that I wasn't too impressed with it. The\nstory is rather ho-hum and bland, not unlike the main character is for\nmost of the movie. What kept me invested was all of the in-jokes and\npop culture references. Nothing was laugh-out-loud funny, but it did\nmake me chuckle consistently. The best bits were probably from Batman,\nSuperman and Green Lantern (voiced by Will Arnett, Channing Tatum and\nJonah Hill, respectively). Another strong point was the large ensemble\nvoice cast, which included Chris Pratt (Emmett), Will Ferrell (Lord\nBusiness), Elizabeth Banks (Wild Side) and Morgan Freeman\n(Vitruvius/The Wizard?). Despite the rather bland story, things were\npractically saved near the end when it takes a rather poignant turn\nwhich I won't spoil (for the few people who haven't seen it yet). The\nend makes everything that came before it worth watching. Still, I can't\nquite bring myself to forgive everything else completely. Among those\nthings is a ridiculously catchy earworm that gets repeated ad nauseam.\nIn the end, it is something that both kids and adults can get enjoyment\nout of, even if it's more fluff than substance\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a curious movie. I had not heard much about it, but knew it was\nhighly regarded. My wife and I started watching it last night, but shut\nit off after about 45 minutes.

Fortunately someone asked if\nmost of the movie is computer animated or actual shots of Lego pieces,\nsort of in a claymation style of animation. As it turns out almost all\nof it uses computer-generated images, but they did it in a way that it\nlooks like real Lego pieces were used. <br><br>I would guess that a person who grew up with Legos (not me) would get a\nbigger kick out of it. There's some funny stuff, like being afraid of\nthe 'Kragle', which we see is 'Krazy Glue' with the letters 'z-y-u'\nscratched out from use. But it mainly seems to want to give the message\nthat each of us has the ability to accomplish great things, and\n'everything is awesome, everything is cool when you're part of a\ngroup.'<br><br>SPOILERS: For most of the movie we see Lego figures and Lego machines\nin various settings, buildings, streets, etc. Their small world is\nanimated, it is as if they are alive, and I suppose in a sense they\nare. But then we see it is a giant Lego set built in a basement, and\nthe dad (Will Ferrell) comes down the stairs to see his young son has\nmade some alterations to what Dad had built. At first dad was angry,\nbut then he realized that his son had to exercise his creativity too.\n"},

A movie about legos is a great idea, but much of the\nfilm is rather awkward and confusing. It's hard to keep track of what's\nwhat. For a little while I was actually having a hard time staying\nawake. What makes it especially weird is how it eventually starts\ntransitioning from the fantasy animated world to the real world. I can\nsee why some people may like this, but I find it to be basically just a\nweird interruption.

{"review": "\nThe Lego Movie is an odd blend of energy and color wrapped around a\npaper thin narrative.

If you ever get the chance to choose a film to go out to\nwatch choose the Lego movie. The reason I've given it ten stars is\nbecause it's funny, inspiring and awesome! when I went to see it almost\nevery one was laughing. There are no dull bits or boring bits in it at\nall. i think it's epic how they put in Lego city, Lego star wars and\nloads more! This film I'd recommend it to absolutely anyone. I was\nlaughing the whole way through the movie! it's the most creative film\nI've ever seen. Whatever you do GET BUYING TICKETS!!! By Archie, aged 8\n"},
{"review": "\nLego Movie in my opinion could go down as one the biggest surprises\never in cinema history. I know the Lego franchise has gone waayy beyond\nexpectations with the toys, models and gaming industry (Lego Harry\nPotter, Lego Star Wars etc etc), but a Lego film I never thought would\nwork, and if one was released, it would be so childish I would never\nlay eyes on it...... How wrong could I be, as this film could easily\nhave just made it in AT LEAST my top 50 of all time.<br><br>First of all, this film will probably only appeal to so many friends,\nunless you're all super perfectly in sync with another. I saw this\ntonight with 3 other people, and only 1, as well as myself were\nlaughing throughout, the other 2, didn't get any of the humour at all.\nThe humour is witty, very immature in places, but perfectly timed. THIS\nIS ONE OF THOSE QUOTE THE FILM FOREVER FILMS!<br><br>However as funny as this film is, and as much as I have already quoted\nBatman in the past 2 hours since seeing the film, it's not the humour\nthat has pushed this film waaaaay beyond expectations. Without giving\ntoo much away, this film has a really deep back story, and a massive\nsurprise towards the end with the story entering a world that I never\nthought would exist in the film, and it really did help explain why the\nfilm was as random as it was, and just brought everything together.\nKudos Lego Movie, Kudos.<br><br>Can not wait to add this to my blu ray collection (the film is\nstunning).\n"},
{"review": "\nMy son &amp; I had a blast watching the Lego Movie. Very funny for adults\nand children. I loled at some parts , great sound track . Very good\nstory made me remember what fun it was to play as a kid and how much I\nmiss that. Had a lot of action too. I would totally see this again. I\ngot that Awesome song stuck in my head. This movie made me way happier\nthan I should be. Even hours later while writing this I am still\nfeeling happy. That is weird right? I mean I am normally not unhappy\nbut I am just not happy either I mean I am just normal feeling but I\nchecked..... Yep Still feeling happy ..... weird but not \"WEIRD\" weird\n, just good weird I guess?. You ever notice that weird is kinda weird\nwhen you spell it it just looks weird ... like kinda wrong but ya know\nyou spelled it right. That is weird ... I think I am tired but I still\nfeel happy. I just wish I could get the Awesome song out of my brain .\nUUUUGGGGHHH !! stupid ear worms any ways go see the movie and be happy\n"},
{"review": "\nI will say that when I saw the preview for this movie I wasn't too\nexcited about it. I was never a fan of Lego's even as a kid and never\nreally played with them. Only through the great reviews and word of\nmouth did I decide why not give this a shot and I'm glad I did.<br><br>I didn't see it in 3D and it might have made it more entertaining with\nthe way the special effects were used. It was a clever piece of work\nwith the way they portrayed water, fire, smoke, and a whole bunch of\ndifferent things.<br><br>Even though most kids will want to see this, its the adults that will\nprobably be heard most in the theater laughing. The jokes are more for\nthe adults but because its Lego's the kids will have a fun time too.\nThere is a bit of a twist at the end that I didn't see coming.<br><br>Overall, its simply just a fun time at the movies that both the kids\nand adults will equally enjoy.\n"},
{"review": "\nGreat story, I don't why the other reviewers don't see it (must not be\nthe special). The story is about how government and business control\n(micromanage) every aspect of your lives and (micromanagers) are\ngovernment agencies. That means that unless you are (a master builder),\nyou are not free. Even the Will Farell in reality is a reference to how\nthe story itself is reality, love it!!! However, unlike the ending to\nthis movie, I don't see business and government ever realizing that by\nletting the people do what they choose out of free will, it will\nbenefit them and it could. Anyway, excellent movie and if you don't see\nthe above in it, watch it again.\n"},
{"review": "\nMy new favorite movie, defiantly the best one I've seen in 2014 so far!\nAs the title suggests, this film has it all:<br><br>- A great story - hilariously memorable funny moments - A wide range of\njust about every theme (though some of my personal ones are missing,\nbut there is always the sequel) - Very much feels and looks like a Lego\nmovie would! - Good music - Great writing at making something feel very\nfresh and unique, when this concept (i.e. Roger Rabbit &amp; Wreck It\nRalph) has been done countless times b4 - An unexpected twist that in\nhindsight makes sense with the theme of the movie - An excellent moral\nabout being your own special stuff and just being natural, that has\nbeen previously portrayed, but in this execution it stays with you as\nyou remain entertained simultaneously - And of course, as per the title\nof this review, the new song that will be trapped in your head:<br><br>EVERYTHING IS Awesome! <br><br>9/10!\n"},
{"review": "\nWith LEGO toys, it was about imagination. Make them move, make them\nfight, have your own stories, have your own ending...where we had to\nmove them ourselves...speak for them ourselves. For me, that was 25\nyears ago. Now when I see it, I'm reminisced a little bit of those\ndays...but the whole story is not grabbing enough. <br><br>Everything is predictable...but then again, the stories I imagined 25\nyears ago were also predictable now. If you are a true LEGO fan and\nstill buy them for yourself or the kids...you'd totally enjoy it...the\nanimation and characters are true LEGO style. And with the trademarks\nthey can use they've done a fun but 'not-so-great' job.<br><br>At my age, I'd think they could do a lot more with the licensing they\nhave...but if I saw this 20 years ago...I'd definitely be mind\nboggled!! <br><br>I am remembering my childhood days when watching the Flame animation\nand faces...but its not enough to rate it at par with the all the other\nwonderful animated movies I have seen this year. For a fact... if you\nhave never ever played with LEGO toys, there are tonnes of better stuff\nout there...which I personally would say you should watch...with a\nlittle bit of Google assistance.\n"},
{"review": "\nAn ordinary Lego construction worker (Chris Pratt), thought to be the\nprophesied 'Special', is recruited to join a quest to stop an evil\ntyrant (Will Farrell) from gluing the Lego universe into eternal\nstasis.<br><br>As much as I dislike posting reviews with spoilers, this will have to\nbe one in order to justify my lower rating. For the most part, until\n66% or maybe even 75% of the movie, I really thought this was one of\nthe best animated features I had ever seen. It looks great, the story\nis good (even if the message is a bit lame and blunt), and there are\nsome genuinely funny moments with old characters in new situations\n(Lando and Batman, for example).<br><br>But here is where they lost me: the introduction of human, live action\ncharacters. When the already obvious message of being against\nconformity and growing up suddenly gets even more obvious by showing\nthe interaction of father and son, it loses me. Why do we have to go\nthere? And why do we have to have the Lego universe exist in a kid's\nimagination and not some real place?\n"},
{"review": "\nHere we go again, Another copy up movie 1st of all, The movie is\nactually alike to Chicken little Here's the reason why, The plot's Is\nalike from Disney.<br><br>The total mayhem is alike, Same thing! They did War of worlds, With\nrobots?! Same Same thing! The movie was Not bad, But its not worse.<br><br>The city is also alike! :NOTE Well I guess it was terrible after all,\nAfter 60 minutes, They started to do a War of the worlds, AGAIN! The\nplots again! The animation again, the City again, But everything else\nbesides the Characters, Including the movie,\nTERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nWish it could have had more substance, but from the opening moments of\nthe film, The Lego Movie fires an endless array of jokes at its\naudience from seemingly every angle. Writers Phil Lord and Christopher\nMiller (who also directed the film) have an expert grasp of the absurd,\nand they use it to great effect, ensuring that every scene is stuffed\nto the gills with laughs. Many of the film's best moments are derived\nfrom the fact that the characters, vehicles, and environments are\ncreated from Lego pieces: one of the rules established by the\nfilmmakers was that everything appearing on screen must be possible to\nconstruct in the real world. It's a good mix of humor, heart, and\ncreativity, and provides a great foundation to build on.\n"},
{"review": "\nA very refreshing and enjoyable film with lots of clever use of\nanimation and humour for both young and old. But I am of the generation\nthat never built Lego - only bought it for the next two generations. It\nis cleverly done as a movie, and the twist twenty minutes from the end\nputs the rest of Hollywood's wunderkind to shame! The characters are\nvery predictable, but put themselves down with a distinct lack of ego\n(but then plastic models can, can't they?). The plot is yet another\nriff on George Lucas with a 'Metropolis' like society needing a Chosen\nOne to release them to freedom - only the one chosen is not really of\nheroic stature. But the journey takes him to his destiny - freeing\neveryone to build their own models and not just what the packet tells\nthem to! It runs out of steam after an hour before the big finish kicks\nin - plastic model cartoons can only go so far! And the animation can\nonly go so far before iteration (like live action Hollywood!), but the\nbiggest product placement in movies works well enough for long enough\nlong enough to give a great deal of pleasure.\n"},
{"review": "\nI can't believe how impressive this movie was. When I first saw it, it\njust blew my mind away. Every about it was lovable. The story, the\nanimation, the cast, the characters, the humor, it was a thrill ride.\nIt's definitely a good film to kick of 2014, and is one that you\ndefinitely don't want to miss. You could tell that they went all out on\nthis. It's one thing to make stop motion in general, but doing with\nLego and making it that good is just impressive. And let's not forget\nthe strong cast which includes Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Liam\nNeeson, Will Ferrel, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, and numerous cameos\nincluding Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Shaq among many others. But\nprobably the best thing about the movie was it's sense of humor. Though\nthe first 10 minutes was quite boring and seemed like a typical\nanimated film, the film spiraled high after wards and will keep you\nlaughing all the way through. All of the cast members like Liam Neeson\nand Morgan Freeman who you would never expect to do something comedic\ngave it there all here, and that only made it 10x funnier. But if\nthere's' some thing I didn't like about the movie, it would have to be\nthe ending. I won't spoil it for you, but there's this little twist in\nthe end that was quite un-expecting, but a bit unnecessary. With all\nhonesty though, the ending wasn't that bad, and some of you may even\nlike it. Overall, The Lego Movie\" is a great movie that' sun for all\nages.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you have young children at home, take them to see this movie \u0096 it's\na must. This is THE kids' movie of the decade. Yes, this flick was\ndesigned for the child equipped with a bottomless pit of energy and in\ndire need of a nap. Hi energy scene after hi energy scene left me\nexhausted and physically drained. Talk about zapping the energy out\nyou. At the end of this carnival of spasmodic plastic rattling and the\nceaseless repetition of, 'Everything is Awesome', I thought my soul had\nbeen sucked out of my eyeballs and felt bodily fluids oozing from my\nears. Granted, the theme is a common premise, but it is easy to\noverlook. What theme you ask? Crying out loud - it's echoed throughout\nmost 'blockbusters' recently produced. You do know the theme, right?\nHere it is as a reminder, \"Big Brother is pushy and overbearing, and\nbrainwashing the masses. The only way to overcome the 'The Collective's\nControl' is through the brave, selfless act of an individual. (kind of\ncuts against the grain of Hollywood \u0096 I like that).\" The cool thing\nabout this movie is that good beats evil using happy-happy-joy-joy\nmethods (and LEGO Batman \u0096 of course) and not arrows shot from burning\ngirls or some powerful, magical female divergent idol. One sad note\nthough. Even though I did see the movie I forgot what it was all about.\nNow remember I do know the movie was a lot of fun, the story left very\nlittle impression. Let me see, how would I put this movie in a\nnutshell? Let's say you had to save the entire world. You also had a\nbox of cute kittens and you gave them each double-shots of espresso \u0096\nwhat would you remember? See this movie\u0085you will like it and then you\nwill appreciate your bed.\n"},
{"review": "\nOne of the first must watch movies of 2014.<br><br>Way better than I though it could be. A lot of funny scenes that will\nkeep all ages entertained. Although a couple of scenes felt longer,\nthat is simple due to how fast and funny the other scenes are.<br><br>The animation and voice work are both brilliant. Will Arnett is great\nas Batman, and Liam Neeson as BadCop/GoodCop was just epic. Also\nCharlie Day as Benny was brilliant and is the star of one of my\nfavourite scenes in the movie (you'll know it when you see it). The\nrest of the cast are fantastic as well.<br><br>Lots of awesome cameos, including some unexpected (but still as\nawesome) ones.<br><br>The plot is simple, but that doesn't mean the movie is any less\nentertaining.<br><br>One of my favourite movies of all time and is still enjoyable on\nmultiple viewings.\n"},
{"review": "\nIf you have not yet seen this movie, here are two heads ups: one, it's\nextremely fast paced so brace yourself, two, if you have seen a lot of\nmovies the plot may get predictable.<br><br>Traffic was slow on this day so I barely made it to the theatre in time\n(about halfway through the previews). So I was a bit stressed when I\nsat down. The fact that the opening of the movie was very fast paced\nand there were so much happening at once did not help my mood. However,\nthe humour kicked in quickly and each one made me at least chuckle. The\nstory eventually slowed down (a little) and I was finally able to fully\nenjoy this movie.<br><br>It's indeed worthy of its praise: the pop-culture references are of\ngood taste, the humour is excellent, the visuals (though hard to keep\ntrack of) are amazing. Even if the movie is fast paced, this is LEGO\nafter all. Having the characters build something slowly than what you\nsee in the commercials would not be LEGO. It's not my favourite movie\nbut I am glad I saw it, and will definitely see it again. Beware: the\ntheme song is very catchy.\n"},
{"review": "\nI watched this yesterday at 2:30pm its now 9:10am and i cannot help but\nthink of this film. I think of the animation the jokes then the little\nsubtle jokes that younger kids wouldn't get and then the beautiful\nanimation and the voice work by Chris Pratt and others i cannot find a\nsingle fault with this film i don't have one maybe the song was\nannoying but i ended up buying the album off iTunes (Everything is\nawesome) i hated it at first and i now love it i cannot think of a\nfault with this movie. Its kinda like a social commentary with\nfollowing instructions and all that and president business voiced\nbrilliantly by Will Ferrell. I found that kids might not respect this\nmovie as much as adults cause there are jokes they will not get I'm\nhonest i heard more GROWN MEN laugh than some of the children. OK the\nvoice acting is outstanding all round my personal favourite is Bad cop\nvoiced by Liam Neeson the voices are great all round. The last 15\nminutes are really heart felt and i couldn't believe that they did\nthat. I will be honest some of the jokes did fall flat and where funny\nbut just didn't lift off like some the others did but thats minor\ncompared to the other jokes and this is a laugh out loud movie and i\nlove this film to death i will go far as to say i enjoyed this a little\nmore than Monsters inc (my favourite animated film in my top 20 at 19)\nand i would say this has just taken my number 18 spot i love this film\ni recommend it for all ages and family's.\n"},
{"review": "\nI used to enjoy a lot of Lego time when I was a child. I used to enjoy\nmost of what was used from pop culture and references in this movie, so\nthis one was basically a gathering of all that was important to me\ngrowing up. <br><br>Pity that it was kinda generic as a movie... the plot is so convoluted\nit makes you scratch your head sometimes. Too much references and no\ntime to develop them properly. It was very promising in the trailer,\nkinda like a mix between Toy Story and Wreck it Ralph, but... those\nlast two, sorry WB, they said it way, way, waaaaaay better the same\nmessage you're trying to give us.<br><br>As a bunch of isolated references from the 80's, it kinda works in that\nnostalgic sort of sense, as an adult, I got entertained with all the\nreferences and I'm pretty sure that kids will have fun beyond belief,\ntoo. As a movie, it turns out to be a convoluted mess. I know that they\ntried to make like (SPOILERS AHEAD!) the imagination of a little kid,\nbut back then, Andy was so much more creative and more addressing! <br><br>Sorry WB, good try, but you're way better with your DC Animated\nUniverse, so stick with that. If you're trying to overcome Pixar,\nwell... better luck next time. Bottom line, it's worth the price of\nadmission once, but just once, like a fireworks show, one viewing it's\nreal fun, a second viewing though, is out of question.\n"}
