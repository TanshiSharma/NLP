{"review": "\n\nAlthough I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this\nmight be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it\nis. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving\ncursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't\nsay more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.<br><br>There aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a\npirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and\nenjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action\nand drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed\nbetween the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add\nto the enjoyment of this movie.<br><br>I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think\nhe deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely\nbecause of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of\nthe supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood\nhigh above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit\nwooden, but other than that the acting was good.<br><br>Basically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10\n\n"},
{"review": "\nDisney seemed to be going down the tubes lately, with Atlantis and Home\non the Range, but this movie is a masterpiece. If it wasn't for this\nmovie, Johnny Depp wouldn't be as famous as he is today. Every scene\nwith him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the\nshots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking\nup at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don't buy DVDs often but\nthis was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and\nplot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film\nitself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's\nmouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films\nyou'll love this, if you like comedy you'll love this, actually, this\nmovie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened\nby the skeleton scenes). 10/10\n"},

The answer is simple:Captain Jack.From\nthe moment he makes his entrance,justly included in the Empire Top 10\nEntrances of all time,we know he's the reason people will keep watching\nthe movie.He 's Depp's best non-Tim Burton-character ever,and I can't\nwait 'til he returns.<br><br>See you next summer,Captain!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a fantastic movie full action, adventure, humor and a hell of a\nlot more! The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but that time flies\nby as you are transported into an awesome world of swashbuckling and\nsword fights.<br><br>Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp\nCaptain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes,\nhe will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes\nof witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son\nof a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the\ndiversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see\nbig things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time\nflick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter, Elizabeth\nSwan. She is also another young, up and coming star with a bright\nfuture ahead of her.<br><br>The film may not be the most historically accurate pirate film of all\ntimes but all that is forgotten as you enjoy the brilliance of this\nmarvelous movie. Did I also catch a subtle omage to the 1953\nswashbuckler 'The Crimson Pirate' when Will and Jack walk underwater in\nan upturned rowing boat? Sneaky!<br><br>The only negative thing I have to say, and believe me I don't want to\nsay it, is that fact we are never told the reason why the curse of the\nblack pearl could only be broken by the blood of William Turner\n(Senior) and in turn by his son. Despite this plot flaw however,\nPirates of the Caribbean is a magical journey that will drop the jaws\nof parents, children and grandparents alike.

{"review": "\nWhat lifts this film above typical Disney fluff is Johnny Depp's\nhumorous performance as pirate Jack Sparrow, the eccentric,\nindividualistic anti-hero, who confronts other pirates, and outwits a\nhumorless, incompetent bureaucratic establishment. Sparrow looks more\nlike Cher than Johnny Depp, and talks more like William F. Buckley than\na pirate. Geoffrey Rush is a worthy foil as the main rival pirate,\nBarbossa, a character who vaguely resembles Margaret Hamilton in \"The\nWizard Of Oz\".<br><br>Most of the plot is silly. There's lots of fighting, shouting, and\ngeneral mayhem, all accompanied by a frantic score. It's a cinematic\nslight of hand that conveys an illusion of substance.

Not subtle, not direct, just genius. The whole plot revolves\naround rescuing... and rescuing... and rescuing, again.<br><br>The second time I saw this film, I thought it was disgusting. What the\nheck, I thought to myself. It's so... so... unrealistic (which is\nreally unlike me, because I adore fantasy- just not too far-fetched in\nthe fantasy world, like Mary-sue or people popping out of no where to\nhelp others). Until I saw it for the third time. I loved it then. (And\nyes, to watch a film for 3 times and have 3 different opinions each\ntime makes the following statement true- 'there is obviously something\nwrong with me.') The thing that made me love this movie SOOOO very much\nwas- 'Freedom'. As Sparrow had said, being a pirate is like having\nfreedom. I had a knot in my stomach when I heard this- I mean, oh my\ngod, I hated being trapped in a boring routine everyday. Being a pirate\nmeant adventures, risks, excitement. And that really attached me to the\nmovie. Whenever I read books or watch TV shows or movies about high\nadventures or fantasy, I almost cry because I'm not the main character-\nit's not me who's having all the fun, and reading these books or shows\nor movies might be the closest thing I will ever be to having the\nadventure of a lifetime.<br><br>Watch this movie.

{"review": "\n\nI have probably seen this movie 15 times. I love movies and I am\nterribly critical of them. When I read the goofs page on this movie, I\nwas shocked to see how many there were. IT is not good that the editors\nlet so many slide. But, as a whole, this is a great mindless movie. I\nread a review by another user that said a good movie is one that raises\nimportant issues and questions; I agree. But, there can be other kinds\nof good movies. This is one! Watch it with an empty mind needing\nentertainment and the willingness to pass off goofs by saying \"it is a\nmovie\" and you will find great satisfaction in Pirates. All in all, I\nwould call this a new classic because it appeals to the masses who\ngenerally care nothing for \"great art films\".\n\n"},

{"review": "\nBefore this film i had never heard of Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly or\nGeoffery Rush but i had heard of Orlando Bloom. I had never even seen\nthe trailer to 'Pirates of the Caribbean'! My sister first saw the film\nand told me so much about it and told me that I really should go and\nsee it with her... I kept on saying no because it just didn't appeal to\nme. I then spoke to other people about it who said it was great so i\nfinally decided to go and see it. From start to finish i was taken on a\nswashbuckling adventure! It had everything that a movie should have...\nlove, comedy, adventure, a kidnapping and cursed pirates after\ntreasure. The film was mainly carried by the fantastic Johnny Depp...\nplaying the slightly drunk Captain Jack Sparrow who's main mission in\nthe film is to get back his ship 'the Black Pearl'. However, he ends up\ntaking on board Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) a blacksmith who is in love\nwith the Governers daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). Elizabeth\nis kidnapped by Pirates and it is up to Jack and Will to save her.\nHowever the Pirates are cursed and are neither living nor dead...they\nmust repay their blood otherwise they will be cursed forever. So as you\ncan see there is a lot to go by on the film. Can Jack Sparrow be\ntrusted? Will they reach Elizabeth before it is too late? Will the\npirates ever be rid of the dreaded curse?

There is chemistry between Depp\nand whomever he shares dialogue with because he is central to the whole\nmovie - thankfully. Depp is my all-time favourite actor, I think he is\nso much more talented than he gives himself credit for. Bloom and Keira\nKnightley form the romance, which expected in all modern movies so I\ncan't complain because the acting is great all round. Another talented\nactor who proves himself in this movie is Geoffrey Rush. Like Depp he\nbrings charisma and comedy to the role, as well as threat. Barbosa is a\ncharacter you love to hate (because of how he treats Sparrow as you\nwill see for yourself and what we learn from their history).<br><br>Jack Sparrow's drunkenness will have you splitting your sides with\nlaughter, believe me. If not then you can't possibly be viewing the\nsame movie. 'Yo ho a pirate's life for me' was sang by Depp and\nKnightley who are rightfully paired by a campfire in one scene. There\nis a spark but the romance is firmly between Will and Elizabeth\n(Knightley).

The movie is pure fun, from the way the characters are\nintroduced for the first time to the action of the saga's original\ntale, scored beautifully by Hans Zimmer (One Of The Best Alongside John\nWilliams). The music has that pirate feel to it, the awesome intensity\nof the action taking place and the confused but comical little tune\nthat plays as Jack Sparrow stumbles around in the mystery. Johnny Depp\ngives a majorly entertaining and unique performance of Jack Sparrow, a\ndwindling hero with his own goals and aspirations.

It was under\nthe brilliant direction of Gore Verbinski (The Ring, The Mexican) that\nthis film's theme could be so easily seen. The Pirates of the Caribbean\nis a visually pleasing display of a true pirate adventure. Captain Jack\nSparrow (Johnny Depp, Edward Scissorhands) steals the show by revealing\nthat not all pirates are cold hearted.

The evil pirate\nBarbosa (Geoffrey Rush, House on Haunted Hill) and his crew are drawn\nto the medallion and will stop at nothing to get it back to break their\ncurse.

Elizabeth had gotten\nher self into a riled up ship of angry damned men. All in all, the\nmovie was great! Righto! I've watched this movie millions of times and\nnever once has it not surprised me. I am in love with Jack Sparrow and\nWill Turner.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nthis has to be one of the best movies i have ever seen! i can watch it\nover and over and never get tired of it...the cast choice was\nPREFECT...and for whoever it was that said in august 2003 that they did\nnot understand why it was only will turner's blood they needed...in\ncase u haven't figured it out yet...they needed blood from everyone who\ntook gold from the chest...barbosa said in his speech when they were\nfirst gonna take blood from elizabeth that each of them has returned\ntheir piece and paid their blood...but hers had yet to be paid...and\nit's why jack cut his hand before he threw his piece of gold to\nwill...that comment was from, like, a year ago...but in case u didn't\nunderstand yet...anywho...the entire cast was awesome in this\nmovie...they couldn't have done better...and the effects and everything\nwere incredible...i hope that the second one is just as good...\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nPirates of the Carribean was quite astonishing in many ways. Although it may\nbe overrated because of the high quality actors such as Johnny Depp and\nOrlando Bloom, it is still worth a try.\n   The scenery is amzing mainly becuase its real and not fake. the music\nhelps capture the momment and the script was pretty well wrote with the\nexception of a few draggy moments. The fight scenes are very good and\nrealistic as well as the over all affect.\n   The casting was actually very good and the characters were protrayed very\nwell. overall---disney lucked out on this movie...9/10\nstars.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nOK. First of all I would like to say that whoever wrote the comment\n\"Great Poster, bad movie\", i respect your opinion, but I completely\ndisagree. Maybe since you kept falling asleep, you didn't get the humor\nand storyline of this movie like you should have. This movie was great.\nI had no problem remembering the plot. Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, AND\nKiera Knightley were fantastic. Orlando Bloom has shown his versatility\nin acting by going from completely different characters and playing\nthem excellently. Johnny Depp deserved that best actor award every bit,\nand I was very sad to learn that he did not receive it. He played a\nconstantly drunken pirate, who had gone a little bit mad, and he did it\nvery well. Kiera Knightley, whose performance in \"Bend it Like Beckham\"\nwas also great, plays a young girl, a little too modern for her time.\nShe stands up for herself, and is also very clever. I would also like\nto mention that Jack Davenport and John Rys-Davies were also very good\nin this movie, and they get too little recognition. Captain Barbosa,\nplayed by Geoffrey Rush, was an awesome bad guy. I absolutely loved\nthis movie.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI thought this was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and\nthought that Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom played their roles to the\nbest of their ability. Kiera Knightly was great as Elizabeth Swan and I\ncan't wait to see the next two movies. I would recommend this film to\neveryone. If you get the chance to see this movie you should. The\nspecial fx were brilliant as were the cast.Everyone I know who have\nseen this movie have loved it. It has action, adventure, romance,\nhorror, excitement and had many funny bits/quotes. Everything a movie\nfan would want. The only bad thing in this movie were some of the\nmistakes they have made; historical, continuity, etc... It was still\nbrilliant though.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nPirates of the Caribbean has lots of different effects and this is what\nmakes it a good film. The key event is when the governor's daughter is\nkidnapped by a crew of dreaded pirates. Watch for Captain Jack Sparrow\nturning into a skeleton when he walks through the moonlight.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the film actually has pirates in it. The director Chris\nColumbus has done a good job. It was an Oscar-winning film and now they\nare working on a sequel. <br><br>The film is rather long and some viewers might get bored, particularly\nif they like serious films. Some of the interior scenes on the video\nversion are rather dark and difficult to see clearly. However, Pirates\nof the Caribbean is exciting and full of suspense, and great if you\nlike pirates. <br><br>The key actors in this marvellous film are Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom\nand Kiera Knightly. Johnny Depp was at his best, and really was Jack\nSparrow. I would advise you to buy this film.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is one of the best films I have ever seen.\nIt is an adventure film which is very funny and it has some romantic\ntouches. The veteran actor Jonhy Depp is excellent in his part as the\nold salt \"Jack Sparrow\", Geoffrey Rush is the best choice for the part\nof the bad character and the attractive Orlando Bloom promises to turn\ninto one of the most important young actors in Hollywood just like\nKeira Knightley. The exotic landscapes and all the setting are some of\nthe best aspects of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", but I would only\ncriticize one thing: you would know the skeletons of \"Captain Barbosa\"\nscrew were made by computers, but it is great. I think I will never see\na better pirates film. In fact I have never been interested in this\nkind of films till I have seen this one.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nTo me this is Johnny Depp's best role, and Geoffrey Rush proved there are\nfew artists like him in the worldwide movie. \nIn general you're sorry for Depp both times he is to be hung. This kind of\nmovie hadn't been shot for a long time, and it's good to continue Walt\nDisney's traditions. `The pirates of the Caribbean' is a fairy tale for\neverybody. I can't imagine anybody who won't enjoy it.<br><br>In the last years it's one of the best projects which must be purchased on\nDVD. \nFor me Jerry Bruckheimer's name is the guarantee of fresh, cheerful, dynamic\nand justice movie, and Gore Verbinski is great. I'll wait for him to direct\nanother one. \nIt was clear Orlando Bloom will a brilliant career, and about Keira Knightly\n\u0096 I'm sure everybody fall in love with her. In one word all the good that\ncan be, you'll find here. \nI recommend everybody who has missed the chance of watching it in the\ncinema, correct the mistake. This film will bring good mood and positive\nemotions. \nAnd now excuse me, I'd rather watch it once again. Thank you for your time.<br><br>\n"},
{"review": "\n\n*Please excuse my horrible pirate language in the summary.*<br><br>Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best Johnny Depp movie ever made!\nIf I were to make a list about the Pros and Cons of this movie, you would\nfind no Cons! Right now I would just like to mention some of the things I\nenjoyed about this movie.<br><br>*Johnny Depp.* Oh my gosh, I am dangerously in love with Johnny Depp. He\nis\nprobably the first reason I went to see this movie. At first when I heard\nabout the movie just coming out, I didn't think it would be too good. Now\nafter I've watched it, I am constantly thinking up new pirate languages\nand\nslang words. &lt;shrugs&gt; A weird old banana, I am.<br><br>*The Pirates.* I LOVE THE PIRATES!!! They are not only very\ncOoOoOol-looking, but they give you a good scare when you first see them!\nI\nliked the part where all the pirates are walking underwater. It shows you\ntheir skeletons while they are walking under the moonlight, but when they\ngo\nunder the shade from the moonlight, they return to normal. Then, out from\nunder the shade they walk, and they transform back into skeletons. Can you\nsay, \"Awesome?\"<br><br>*The Special Effects.* Special effects were awesome in this movie! Very\nsimilar to Haunted Mansion, this movie has probably the best special\neffects\nin any other movie.<br><br>There are many other things I loved about this movie, but it would take me\nabout 300 years to point them out. ;)\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI missed out on seeing Pirates of the Caribbean on the big screen, and\nnow\nI wish I hadn't. I first saw it at my friend's place on DVD and I loved it\nimmediately and really wanted to see it again.\nThe characters are all perfect for their parts, Orlando Bloom plays an\nexcellent Will Turner, Kiera Knightly is great as the pretty governor's\ndaughter, Geoffry Rush is a superb villain, and Johnny Depp's funny antics\nbring the movie together to make a masterpiece on film.<br><br>I had no idea what I was about to witness as I sat on the couch, not\nhaving seen any of these actors (Except Orlando, LOTR) in a movie before.\nBy\nthe time it finished, I was laughing so hard I could hardly breath. I\nloved\nJohnny in the boat at the start, Orlando's heroism throughout the movie,\nand\nthe kiss at the end. Everything was so perfect that I wished it would\nnever\nstop, and now it's one of my fave movies of all time!\nThere's only one thing I don't get though. Why did Jack Sparrow cut his\nhand at the end just before he passed the medallion to Will? I would love\nto\nget an answer to that.    \n"},
{"review": "\n\nEveryone loved Johnny Depp in this movie and no doubt, he deserved that\nOscar nomination\nbut if it didn't have him,\nit'll be some swashbuckler with Orlando Bloom which wouldn't attract much\nexcept girls.<br><br>I'm not saying Captain Jack Sparrow is the only good thing. The special\neffects, costumes and performances from others such as Geoffrey Rush and\nMacKenzie Crook (Gareth from the Office in a Hollywood movie, yeah!) also\nto\nthe arrival of Keira Knightley.\nBut do watch it as it is a great fantasy adventure film.\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI am the type of person who hates action movies so for me to tell you that\nthis movie rocked is a big deal. It might help that I'm the biggest Johnny\nDepp fan though.\nDon't be fooled by the Disney name...it's not the same old sugary crap you\nexpect from Disney (even though that's what's to be expected as Disney is\nusually geared towards children). It's got a great story and the acting is\nbrilliant. I'm not a big Kiera Knightly fan but I think she did a good job\nin the film. There is alot of action so if you're into that kind of stuff\nthen you'll love this film.\nI think what I liked best about this film, though, (aside from Johnny\nDepp)\nis that there's a romance story laced inside of the crude world of piracy.\nOrlando and Kiera's characters are in a sort of forbidden relationship and\nthey fight for eachother through the whole movie.\nJohnny Depp makes you laugh, Geoffrey Rush disgusts you (good actor, gross\ncharacter), and Orlando and Kiera make you sigh in jealousy. Great movie\nfor\ndates because you've got the love story and the action flick all in\none.\nI'm not gonna tell you the story, just see the movie, you won't be\ndisappointed.\n"},

Along with\nOrlando\nKierra makes this movie an exciting romance. All I can say is that I wish\nit\nwas me being kissed at the end of the movie instead of Kierra!!

{"review": "\n\nI have to be one of the biggest fans of this movie.  I loved every minute of\nit.  One word of caution though, it is rated PG and I think is produced by\nDisney, so even though there's raggedy pirates and sword fights, there is no\ncursing, nudity or bloody scenes.  That certainly didn't take away from it\nas far as I was concerned.<br><br>Johnny Depp stole the show and played his part very well.  Geoffrey Rush\n(Barbossa) also did a fine job as did the rest of the cast.  I wasn't overly\nimpressed with Orlando bloom, Keira Knightley, or Jack Davenport but they\ndidn't do a poor job and certainly didn't take away from the film.  I guess\nyou could say I liked all the pirates the best, the rest of the cast were\ndecent fillers.<br><br>I loved the humor flow of this movie, when I saw it in the theaters, I must\nhave been the only person who had ever been on the Pirates of the Caribbean\nride at Disneyland, as I completely busted up in the first jail scene, as\nwell as a few other scenes, whereas no one else did.  I didn't find the\nmovie the least bit scary, but I wouldn't show it to a very young kid either\nas it would probably scare the pants off them.  All in all this movie had\ngreat acting, mainly by the two characters I already mentioned, a decent\nstory, great effects and battle / fight scenes, and a good overall flow.  I\nown this movie and have probably seen it more than 10 times.  By far the\nbest movie I've seen this year, with Kill Bill and ROTK being a semi close\nsecond/third.<br><br>I certainly hope they make a part II, and If they do, definitely keep Depp\nin, without him, it wouldn't have been the 10 /10 that I rated\nit.\n\n"},
{"review": "\n\nI loved the movie!  Johnny Depp was hilarious in this film.  I have never\nseen him take a role like this and this one he took and did well!  Love ya\nJohnny Depp!<br><br>Orlando Bloom I thought was also amazing.  Although it totally floored me\nwhen I found out he was the blonde in Lord of the Rings.  I thought it was\ntwo different people.  Don't ya love it when actors or actresses can\nchange\ntheir looks and make you do a double take?  Orlando, you have my\nheart!<br><br>My kids love the movie and we think it's great!  Anybody that wants to\ncheck\nit out, feel free, it's a good choice!  One thing we loved about it the\nmost\nit not only does it twist and turn leading you blindly into the story and\nkeeping you entertained for hours but it's one of those movies you can\nwatch\n1,000 times and still enjoy it and never get tired of.<br><br>\n"}
