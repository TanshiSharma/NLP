{"review": "\nI loved the first part. It was fun. So, naturally my expectations for\nthe second movie was high. That, and a metascore of 88 on the first\nday, naturally, I expected a masterpiece. But what i saw was just\nawful. <br><br>The first few scenes have no dialogues, it's all sign language, with a\nbit of monkey sound here and there(60% of the film, actually). That\nputs you to sleep right away. There are no awe inspiring scenes, not\none frame of amazing graphics. The \"emotions\", well, didn't work for\nme.<br><br>Story? Okay. Humans want to repair a dam nearby so that they can get\nelectricity, Caesar allows them to work, and asks other monkeys to\nhelp. Meanwhile, mean monkey Koba goes to Human place and sees a bunch\nof weapons. So, it comes back, attempts to kill Caesar and then starts\na war with the humans. Climax? Meh.<br><br>Sincere advice, don't watch this. Franco and the cute little monkey, in\nthe first part entertained me. This one put me to sleep.\n"},
{"review": "\nI think I just watched an Old Testament epic from the 1950s - so\nearnest and plodding with high ideals and dull dialogue.<br><br>The only interesting character in the film was Coba, when he acted the\nfool in the armory. The rest were just family-values people trying to\nbe good. The lead actor was dull, and why was Oldman cast as a military\ncommander with his squeaky voice - it actually broke like a teenager's\nwhen he was giving commands.<br><br>So much of it was predictable, and you just knew it was going to end\nwith a punch up. Almost gave up half way through.<br><br>I really don't want to say much more. Totally inferior to Rise and a\ngreat disappointment.\n"},
{"review": "\nI love Christopher Nolan, He has simply changed the way\nsuperhuman,extraordinary thrillers are made. Now everyone is just\nfollowing him. Most of the Directors are trying to show the dark and\nmore realistic environment in the movies and MATT REEVES succeeded in\nit.<br><br>It is a extremely well-made and enacted movie. What works is the\nintensity of the characters. Caesar is the character taken straight out\nof the last installment, Rise of the Planet of the apes. He is the\nbrains and the brass together. The movie is entertaining and includes a\nsurprising ending.<br><br>The film has got some amazing graphics. The Apes look real and in every\nway you sympathize with them. I would rate it 9 out of 10 just for\ngraphics,acting and the intensity of the film.<br><br>DO WATCH !!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film is fun and exciting the whole way through.

There are a few parts that could have been\ndone better here; But mainly this film is very solid writing wise and\nvery entertaining. The film develops it's characters, especially many\nof the apes far better than most action films these days as well. The\nlead up to war here is done extremely well for the most part.

{"review": "\nI have always been a huge fan of the Planet of the apes franchise and\nit is my belief that this movie ticks all boxes and could be admired by\neveryone. This movie is the perfect sequel to Rise of the planet of the\napes. It believe the story is great as it takes us away nicely from\nRise of the planet of the apes and leaves us on a cliff edge, eagerly\nanticipating the third of the trilogy 'War of the planet of the apes\"\nset for release in 2017. I found the movie gripping and i often delved\ninto a range of different human emotions which I found fascinating as\nthe movie depicts apes with advanced intelligence reminding me how\nclose of a sub species we are to apes. The role of Caesar is\nwonderfully played by Andy Serkis also know for playing the role of\nGolem from Lord of the rings. He obviously put a lot of effort and\nhomework into this role.

It shows how\nthe slavery and oppression of humans began in the Planet of the Apes\nfranchise and from there, the war between Ape and Man begins. <br><br>The ending is just the beginning... of World War III.

{"review": "\nIf there is a must see movie of the summer, it is surely Dawn of the\nPlanet of the Apes. It was simply an amazing movie full of sentiment,\nfamily unity/trust, and the many hardships that basic survival can\narise. In Caesar, you have a complex being full of depth who simply\nwants to exist in peace and provide for his loved ones and community.\nBut as history has shown, life is often one tragic story full of\nviolence, deception, and sorrow. Yet hope, if truly sought and fought\nfor, can also exists behind all that shadow and horror. As Caesar so\nprofoundly put it \"ape started war, but human don't forget\" and these\nwords could not be any more valid, especially during these dark times.\nWith all their complexities, humans still do remain the most violent\nand treacherous of beasts.

Well, maybe they'll get to that in the next one, because this\nwas more about a relatively small group of smart apes, living in\nsolitude for a decade, who soon discover humans still exist, and must\ndecide how to get along with them (if possible), in a remote part of a\nworn down san francisco. Unlike the first movie, the events that take\nplace probably wouldn't effect the world very much, and ultimately\nseem...well rather insignificant.

{"review": "\nThis was a good film and I really enjoyed it but to me it wasn't as\ngood as the first one. This one was light on the action and focused\nmore on drama with conflicts igniting within the human world as well as\nthe ape world. Basically it was about united we stand, divided we fall,\nfor both sides. With that in mind I think the more advanced the apes\nget in the films the more like humans they become, and not in a good\nway and I think that is what Ceasar, the leader of the apes, is going\nto start realizing. I think this film is just setting the stage for a\nthird installment of the new \"Planet of the Apes\" motif anyway.

Committing acts for\nsurvival is greatly different from seeking power and revenge. I'm used\nto it with humans but I expect better from animals.<br><br>The one thing I can't get my head around is even after a decade of\nliving in a post apocalyptic wasteland the humans still had a plentiful\nsupply of automatic weapons and ammo.

Just like humans, isn't it.\nHowever, the story does not go anywhere. I mean, we know how it starts,\nit is explained in \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" and we know how it\nends as explained in \"Planet of the Apes\", so this should be an\nintermediate part of the saga. But the only thing we learn is what we\nalready learned from the previous film, which is that humans and apes\ndon't get along. In the final film of the saga it is shown that humans\nget to be submissive, tamed and exploited by the apes, but this\ntransition is not yet made in this movie. That's a missed opportunity,\nI think. It could have added some spice to the plot.\n"},

Guess what, I ended up really\nenjoying it. I like the dark undertones that have been added, bit like\nthe Batman franchise. So I was ready to see this latest one and\nabsolutely loved it. Great special effects again, and Andy Serkis as\nCaesar and Toby Kebbell as Koba are just brilliant. Gary Oldmans\ncharacter is a bit vague, seems quite tame at first but completely\nchanges later on. I foresee at least a couple more films in the future.\nIf you like the genre you'll love this film.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie does what most sequels fails to accomplish. Dawn of the\nPlanet of the Apes is better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes in\nbasically every way. The CGI and Motion Capture is much better in Dawn\nthen it was in Rise, and Rise had some impressive visual effects. The\nApes in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes are so well realized, that there\nare some scenes in this movie that convince you that there are real\napes on the screen, not just because of the incredible CGI, and the\nfact that this movie is directed beautifully by Matt Reeves, but also\nbecause the actors portraying the apes do such a great job of acting\nlike apes in their motion capture work, especially Andy Serkis and Toby\nKebbell. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes also has a very gripping story,\nand very good acting, not just by the actors playing apes, but the\nactors playing humans as well. Definitely one of my favorite movies\nthis year, of the ones I have seen, if not my favorite. On IMDb I give\nit an 8/10, but my own personal rating would be about an 8.5/10.\n"},
{"review": "\nDawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is an amazing movie if you enjoy action\nmovies then this is a great movie if you like story and tense moments\nthen this is also amazing. I loved the film and think it's possibly the\nbest film of 2014. The moments when bullets are shot it's loud and you\nwill most likely jump the movie is amazing and deserves the 10\n.Nothing, absolutely nothing, in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes falls\nshort of being amazing.

Amazingly shot and VERY\narchetypical in its approach, makes one at least think for a bit, what\nmight happen IF the Apes of today ONLY learn how to use tools. They\nwill pretty much take over... Love the series and the idea behind! The\nfilm is FUN and makes sense!\n"},
{"review": "\nA commendable and thrilling sequel to the first part. The series\ncontinues to be intelligent, and develops intriguing conflicts between\ncertain lead characters.

Actors like Andy Serkis (Caesar) and Toby Kebbell (Koba)\nare commendable in their ape characters. Other supporting actors like\nJason Clarke and Gary Oldman are commendable in their roles.<br><br>The character developments are predictable, but intriguing. There are a\nfew plot-holes regarding the humans' stay in city and apes' armed fight\nscenes, but they can be ignored. Overall, the movie is spectacular and\nenjoyable.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film is a really good, modern day sequel. After thoroughly\nenjoying the first film, this film takes you down a completely\ndifferent path and is quite frankly outstanding. If they had a stand\nout character/actor in this film then I would have given it a 10. But\nquite frankly, the scripting and CGI is simply amazing. I really don't\nwant to give anything away in this film so I am going to keep this\nreview short and brief. It's all about the Monkeys... You almost grow a\ncase of affection for the Orangutan. The ONLY criticism I have about\nthis film is that the Gorilla (I forget his name) does not play a\nbigger role in the film.\n"},
{"review": "\nCan't say much without spoiling but the movie is awesome, absolutely\nloved it. The effects and animation looked very realistic. This is the\nbest \"planet of apes\" movies to the date. All the action, drama and\nCaesar's heroic character had me excited on the edge of my seat. This\nmovie should have at least been nominated for Oscar. The movie truly\ndepicts flaws in human nature, and also warns that \"ebola\" was\npreplanned. The cast of the movie is also amazing and I hope the next\npart also includes them. Thanks for the fun writers and direction,\nalthough the movie could have been even more trail-blazing. But, lets\nexpect that from the next part.\n"},
{"review": "\nI was hooked! The CGI effects were stunning. However, it was rather\ndisconcerting to see apes riding horses. <br><br>There were absolutely brilliant action scenes. Some were particularly\nwell shot like the tank sequence turning round to reveal the battle\nscene. <br><br>This movie makes you think about what it means to be human. It blurs\nthe line between humans and apes that you no longer think of them as\nprimates anymore but rather as non-humans. I had fun in the scenes\ntrying to identify who was actually ape and human based on their\nbehaviour. Each were capable of love and terrible violence, the\nemotional range having already been established in the first movie.\nThat being said, I felt the non-humans had many more and deeper\nemotional scenes than those of the humans. One reason being that given\nthe non-humans limited vocabulary, everything they say came across more\npowerful.<br><br>9/10 rotten bananas.\n"},
{"review": "\nA lot of people will applaud Andy Serkis for his portrayal of Caesar\nbut Toby Kebbell's portrayal of Koba completely steals the show.\nKebbell shows all the hate and rage that Koba holds towards humans and\nproves to a powerful enemy against Caesar. <br><br>Though in the film there are under developed relationships between\nCaesar &amp; his family and there are some characters that you are meant to\nfeel for but in the end you don't because their character is so under\ndeveloped. <br><br>Overall Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a amazing sequel that opens a\nlot of doors to the franchise. And introduces a brilliant and well\nacted villain. Dawn also shows us the new motion capture technology and\nwith out a doubt creates beautiful looking characters and makes way for\na new form of acting.\n"},
{"review": "\nI saw DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES! For those of you who were blown\naway by it's predecessor, hold on to your jiggly bits because this next\nchapter in the apes saga packs just as hard a punch as the last one,\nmaybe even more. This movie, directed by Cloverfield director Matt\nReeves, is another lesson to Hollywood that teaches that just because a\nmovie's premise is silly, it doesn't mean we are allowed to be lazy.\nDawn has it all! It's got lots of action, Shakespearian style writing,\nnext level special effects and on top of that, dynamite performance by\nJason Clarke, Gary Oldman and CGI acting king Andy Circus. If you're a\nPlanet of the Apes fan, do yourself a service and check this movie out.\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes gets a well deserved 4.5...out of 5.\n"},

Today's movies mostly have no plot\nand if they do the same old plot type; downtrodden \"monkey\" gets his\nrevenge on Humans.<br><br>I actually thought the \"Planet of the Apes 2001\" was ALLOT better with\na better plot. The end of the movie he goes back through the worm hole\nand crash lands back on earth; but what he finds he didn't expect. Now\na sequel to that movie would have been far far better than this one..\nExcept this version went back to the \"apes\" back to treating \"Humans\"\nas slaves. The movie this time relies way too much on CGI effects and\ngoes in a direction even anyone could not imagine.

{"review": "\nDawn of planet of the apes is action/ post apocalyptic film which has\nas director Matt Reeves. Main actors are Judy Greer ( Corn\u00e9lia ), Gary\nOldman ( Dreyfus ), Keri Russell ( Ellie ), Jason Clarke ( Malcolm )and\nAndy Serkis as C\u00e9sar. Ten years after the beginning of the \" simian flu\n\", most of people are dead. In San Francisco, a group of survivors\nwants to find others survivors around the world. For that, they have to\nreach an hydroelectric factory which is on the apes's estate. Those\nones, with C\u00e9sar as leader, are afraid from humans. A war will start..\nIn my opinion, this is a gripping and dazzling film. The post-\napocalyptic atmosphere is perfectly done, the acting and special\neffects are incredible ( For example, we can see the fear into the eyes\nof apes,.. ) In the other hand, when the movie stops ( even if it is\nnot a real end because it's the first film of trilogy ), you just want\nto see it again because the plot is really immersive and taking. I'd\nrecommend it to all people who likes action films or simply the\nprevious planet of the apes saga.\n"},

{"review": "\nWatched it after 2 months of release and I love the way the story is\nbeen explained. People say its predictable but the movie has shown the\ntrue color of human nature. It shows how hatred can bring war and war\ncan bring destruction. The father and son story of Ceasar and his son\nwas heart touching. Its probably the best ape movie ever. I already\nloved the first two parts of the movie. I would recommend it as a\nsensible family entertainment. For me it is the superhero Ceasar I\nwanted to watch. It doesn't show what happens to Ceasar and his Ape\nfamily. The scene which gave me goosebumps is when Koba said \"Ape don't\nkill apes\" just to survive and Ceasar killed him saying \"Ape don't kill\napes, but you are not ape\".\n"},
{"review": "\nDawn of the planet of the Apes is an absolutely fantastic movie that\nreally surprised me. 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes surprised me\nbecause I thought it looked like a piece of Hollywood garbage. It\nlooked like they were just trying to redo a classic franchise by\ndigitizing the characters and giving it a horrible reboot. When I\nfinally saw it, I was very pleased by the fantastic screenplay and\nmotion capture work, it was one of the best movies of 2011. If you\nenjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes, you will adore Dawn of the\nPlanet of the Apes. Andy Serkis' performance as Caesar is absolutely\nheartbreakingly emotional, the action sequences are very well directed,\nand the script is even better than the first one's. It is a sequel that\nimproves on every single level of it's predecessor. The score is\nbetter, the script is better, the motion capture is better, EVERYTHING\nABOUT THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE.

The chemistry between the two was so\ncompellingly tragic that it is easy to emotionally invest into them.\nThe humans do put up a really good show, but I say that the apes are\nthe more interesting characters here thanks to the improvement in the\nCGI.<br><br>I strongly recommend watching this movie because it will be worth your\nmoney and time!\n"},

The characters were very strong\nand well thought out. The mixture of emotion and action was perfect.\nThis movie focuses more on the apes rather than the humans which\nexplores the progression of the apes as a civilization. Would I\nrecommend this movie? Definitely. This movie deserves more attention\nthan Transformers 4 which I thought was terrible.\n"},

I don't think there is\nany but it is a very good portrayal of two different societies. The\nsavages and the domestic switch sides in this movie.<br><br>So is this a movie about humans fighting against monkeys or monkeys\nfighting against human? Both. In some ways, it reminded me of Jarhead\nand the futility of war and fighting, how there is no real winner.<br><br>Go watch it. It's maybe the best movie seen in the last months.

We as\nindividuals and communities must learn to forget the wrongs of the past\nto create a good future. Other lesson is that no community is good or\nbad. It is individuals that are good or bad. Different communities can\nlive together. Also what stands out are the leadership qualities of the\nleader of apes.
