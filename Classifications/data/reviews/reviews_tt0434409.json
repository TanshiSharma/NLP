{"review": "\n\"Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot.\nI see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.\" <br><br>I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read\nit to appreciate the movie. I saw the film last night at it's World\nPremiere at the Berlin International Film festival. Though it became a\nlittle weighty in the middle (one part seemed to drag a little) other\nthan that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I\ngot seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent\njob with the mysterious title character \"V\", creating a poetic,\nintelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always\nseems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She portrays\ntremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the\nmovie. This is one of those movies that really sticks in your head long\nafter you watch it though... and it continues to stir and grow.\n"},
{"review": "\nI am speechless. I just came back from the theatre, where I watched 'V\nfor Vendetta'. There are three main elements in the movie and it excels\non all three of them.<br><br>First off the dialogues and script. Intense, witty, honest but not\npatronising, intelligent but not pretentious. That's the first level at\nwhich the movie surprises you. You don't except such high level of\nscript from an action movie. But it is slowly revealed to the audience\nthat V for Vendetta is not just an action movie. The story is filled\nwith current events and has a definite strong political sense.<br><br>Secondly Hugo Weaving's performance. It is definitely what grabs you\nfrom the start. He delivers some of the hardest lines with incredible\ncharisma. His performance shines throughout the movie and honestly he\nsounds as good as any of the best actors out there. He should be\nnominated for an academy award.<br><br>Finally the visual part. Incredible, yet no \"Matrix\" effects used.\nEverything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top\nnotch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.<br><br>Do not miss 'V for Vendetta'. It's one of the best movies of all time,\nan eternal classic.<br><br>10/10\n"},
{"review": "\nThere are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin\nto Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly\ndramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol\nof drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why,\nif you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you\nchoose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I\njust saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is\nnothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V\nmanages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and\nhighly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that\npervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is\nendowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as\na mere action adventure.<br><br>The acting, the cinematography, the effects, and the general vision of\nthis film all lead me to believe that it will likely receive a cult\nfollowing. It is only my hope that the message of this film will come\nto summarize the history of our future ascendancy to true liberty.<br><br>Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your\ncountry. In the meantime, go see this movie.\n"},

{"review": "\nwell... all i can say is goddamn.<br><br>keeping in mind that anytime you see a movie as part of a major film\nfestival world premiere, where the cast and creators are present, along\nwith hundreds of avid film fans and press, it tends to raise the\nexperience a notch or two... but having said that - i found it to be a\nwork of monumental genius. i thought it was so amazingly good in fact\nthat i actually had to say something as extreme as that to express my\ncurrent mood towards it, which is still only a mere fraction of how i\nfelt when i actually left the theatre. it was seriously that good.<br><br>and yes, i'm biased, if you can call it that. but i like the\nwachowski's for a reason, not blind admiration. they're geniuses, and\nthey've trained mcteigue well.<br><br>naturally, i think it will be under-appreciated by much of the general\npublic as its not nearly as action-packed as the trailer would have you\nbelieve, but whether it makes 100 mil or 200 mil, it should at least\ncompletely redeem the wachowski's legacy in even the most critical of\ncritic's minds.<br><br>i have to say, the rush of adrenaline i felt when...well, you know if\nyou've seen the trailer - made me want to stand u and cheer. when a\nmovie can make you feel like that, it's succeeded.\n"},

{"review": "\nIf this had been a children's-movie rated by children getting the 8.3\nit got, I would have understood.

{"review": "\nWhile critics scratch their heads at questions like, \"Can a terrorist\nbe a hero?\" and \"How could one man do everything V does?\", they miss\nthe metaphor, and the point, of V for Vendetta.<br><br>V at one point in the film says, \"...ideas are bulletproof.\" The idea\nof this film is that unless the citizens of a country question their\ngovernment's spin and propaganda, they will succumb to the policies of\nthat government no matter how wrong-minded those policies may be.<br><br>I'm sure it's difficult for pigeon-holing critics to accept a Wachowski\nBrothers script that doesn't revolve around the action sequences, but\ninvestigates the castigation of an entire society using engaging\ndialogue and intense, involving characters. And after the Matrix\nsequels, this is somewhat understandable. However, V for Vendetta not\nonly surpasses those disastrous sequels, but the original Matrix as\nwell in terms of cohesiveness and depth.<br><br>This film must be a nightmare realized on screen for Republicans and\nconservatives the world over. They would have to label all of the\nnon-government characters as \"unpatriotic\", and V himself an insane\nterrorist. They probably don't understand that he represents every\nfree-thinking citizen of the world who is concerned about the actions\nand policies of his/her government, even though this point is made\nseveral times in the film. Further, they probably don't understand that\nthe violent actions of V and his compatriots are symbolic of everything\nfrom peaceful protests over the War in Iraq to Senator Russ Feingold's\nresolution to censure President Bush. On second thought, they probably\ndo see this comparison, and believe these non-violent actions to be\njust as outrageous as the blowing up of government buildings!<br><br>Discussions of governments gone awry aside, V for Vendetta is a\nrock-solid film that kept me riveted and unblinking for the entire 132\nminutes.

{"review": "\nIf you enjoyed Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel from 1988 --\nas I did -- do yourself a favor and avoid this pale rendition. Alan\nMoore has disassociated himself from this film, and with good reason. A\nfew of the character names are the same, and a couple of sequences bear\na slight resemblance -- but that's it. The fire, the passion, the heart\nand soul that so infused the novel is completely absent. The screen\nstory was already written, and the filmmakers ignored it, rewriting\nwhole scenes, cutting out others, eliminating a good 75% of the story's\npower, meaning and resonance. The characters are shallow, empty husks\nof their original selves, and the pacing is abominable. Nowhere in this\nsuperficial yawnfest is the true understanding of revolution made\nmanifest. Nowhere is the audience truly brought in to and made a part\nof V's tormented motivations or Evey's harrowing journey. That would\nrequire some creative camera lingering, and sets that didn't look like\nsound stages.

This is not however what bothers me most\nabout the film. the real problem is the writing. With the exception of\na few moderately neat scenes, most of the film boring, with not much\nplot progression, and the script includes a lot of silly and\npretentious lines which sound clever but arn't.

Not to mention that it makes a\ncritic to many things,like the power that the minority has from the\nmajority (And that happens in most governments) the fascism, the\nprejudice against everybody who is different, the control that the\ngovernment has from everything that happens in a country( many ways\neven creating lies for scare their people and give them( the\ngovernment) credit), the hypocrisy of many members of the catholic\nchurch and so on.<br><br>The plot is : In a near-future Britain after a war, the world is a bit\ndestroyed and an extreme fascist party called Norsefire has arisen.\n\"V\", an anarchist revolutionary dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask, begins an\nelaborated campaign to bring down the government and awake the people\nto protest against the way of life they are all living. He counts with\nthe help of Evey, a young woman who was rescued by him. Besides wanting\njustice, V has reasons from his past to kill the members of the Party.\n"},

The concept of freedom struggle as opposed\nto terrorism, the idea of 'terrorism is in the eye of the beholder' is\nfundamental to this film.<br><br>* spoiler * The final images of the film when the London Parliament is\nblown up draws in my view a direct parallel to the Twin Towers. Another\nsymbolic building representing power of state is demolished by an enemy\nof the state, showing clearly that black and white statements often do\nnot do justice to reality (and no I'm not saying the WTC is identical\nin any way). In this case the bomb clearly sets people free, it's a\nweapon of liberation and by using this kind of daring symbolism in\ntheir film, the Warchowsky brothers use art and movies for a serious\ncriticism on the current state of the world where good vs evil and\n(fairy)tales of fiction rule politics - A great film.\n"},

Using Muslims and homosexuals as\nscapegoats for the things wrong with society and lying about searching\nfor weapons so as to torture citizens in unknown prisons are parallels\nto today's America, even though the movie took place in the future in\nEngland. :) I was amused that the USA had been through a Civil War and\nwas now a Leper Colony. That's a WONDERFUL future for the Americans,\nwouldn't you say? (I'm being sarcastic of course) I didn't care for\nsome of the slow motion knife twirling, but even that was overpowered\nby V actually slicing someone. The great thing about this film is that\nit's almost unbelievable and ridiculous to a point, but because V\nrepresents all the people (as Natalie Portman's character states in the\nfilm) you feel sucked in and you love V as a hero, you want him to\nrepresent you.<br><br>I also like how they did have some humor in the film. When Evey wakes\nup and goes into the kitchen, V is in a frilly apron making her\nbreakfast.

{"review": "\nRemember remember the fifth of November When I first watched V for\nVendetta I didn't know much about it. However I have always had a\nfascination with darker comic book movies such as The Crow and some of\nthe Batman's. I am going start by saying that the character of V played\nbrilliantly by Hugo Weaving is one of those characters that will be\nremembered and is an instance classic. This in truth is 1 of my\nfavourite Natalie Portman performances, she is just so full of\ndetermination and curiosity and it's infectious. The scene where V and\nEvey first meat is truly tremendous. V saves Evey from some men trying\nto rough her up, she does hold her ground, V shows off some kick ass\nmoves and a very versatile vocabulary (see what I did there). One of\nfavourite things about V is he is an antihero yet he still views\nhimself as a sort of freedom fighter who is standing up for the\nopposing government. The reason why I love this movie so much is the\ntrue determination to do what is right and the casualties that had to\nhappen. V was a broken body but a free soul that wanted to make a\ndifference and he did so. Was everything planned, I don't know but all\nI know is this movie is a must watch and truly is amazing\n"},

A\nvigilante known only as V is trying to stop the government from ripping\npeople's freedoms away by using a danger plan involving terrorist\nattacks and well timed murders. The movie follows Evey, a young woman\nwho plays the key role to V's plan without even knowing. The movie\nstarts with V, the vigilante, jumping down from the rooftops and saving\nEvey from a group of England's oppressive law enforcement. Afterwards,\nhe inquires that Every come with him to see something he had set up.\nShe reluctantly follows to see that he has blown up a government\nbuilding and hacked into all of the speakers around the city which he\nhad made to be shouting classical music as the building exploded into\nthe night sky, fireworks streaking through the air. As the movie goes,\ngets into trouble as he sends a message to the whole town over a\ngovernment frequency about how they have been censoring everything and\nstands for and stifling the whole city to ensure their rule. He also\ncomments that in one year of the explosion he will act again, but even\nbigger and more destructive. The rest of the film follows Evey as she\ntries to survive on the run as the year passes. This movie focuses a\nlot around the idea of rights and how the government can control its\npeople. Throughout the movie we see the government use censorship to\ncontrol how the people act and feel. During V's first terrorist attack\nhe plays classical music. The government bans this music from being\nplayed to do this to try and make people forget the event. Another\ninstance in the movie where censorship came into play was near the end\nwhen they banned any clothes that looked like V's clothes to try and\ndeter people from helping him or following in his footsteps. This movie\nis great representation of why civil rights are so important and is in\ngeneral a really great movie.\n"},

Yet during\nthe course of the movie, Mr Creedy's past deeds and his zealotry push\naside Adam Sutler as the main antagonist and allow Mr Creedy to take\nthe spotlight as the main antagonist.

Northern England by an\nAmerican cannot be easy!! What I also enjoyed about the film was the\nway that everything was laid out like a TV serial of a crime. I felt\nlike I was watching a special drama. Not many films can do that. The\ndanger with a film put in the genre of action is that the writers and\nproducers go overboard with the special effects because that's what the\npublic expects. The specials in 'V' were effective because they were\nused necessarily. What carried the story was the dialogue, but the film\nwas still action. I thought the finale was excellent and very fitting\nfor the film. Definitely worth a watch.\n"},

Of all the films of \"masked\" heroes, I\nnormally can't wait for the moment the wearer is revealed. Until now.\nWhat lies beneath the Guy Fawkes grin is unimportant, both to me in the\naudience, and eventually to Evey. It's not the man himself that the\nfascists seek to find and destroy...but the IDEA he represents. After\nthe molten dreck that was MATRIX 2 and 3, The Wachowski brothers have\nredeemed themselves with this film. ****SPOILER**** The ending is\nbittersweet.

{"review": "\nIf you really think about it, V himself is kind of sexy. I mean you\nhave a man who always wears the same mask but has different emotions\nand persona's. Even though the mask never changes, one can understand\nthe emotions beyond the mask and really feel for the character. When\nhe's angry you can feel it regardless of that grin, and when he's sad\nor upset that's visible as well. (Possible Spoilers) At the end when\nEvey begs him to stay and kisses the mask on the lips, you can almost\nfeel him tremble and when he says I can't, the voice is one of a man\ntrapped in hell because he wants to stay with her but also needs to\nfinish what he started. When he stumbles back after the last fight and\ncollapses in her arms, he tells her that even though he's glad its\nalmost over, he never expected to fall in love again or rather didn't\nthink he was capable again after the last time. Despite the same black\nclothes and the same wig, hat, and that Guy Fawkes mask, you can tell\nthat he loves her with all of his heart. A heart that has been scarred\nwith the horrors of his life, but still just before he dies you can\nfeel him redeemed because of her. Even though this movie is packed with\naction its also a really high-tech future-istic love story. At first I\nthought that V should have let Evey see his face but than I realized\nthat it made him who he was trying to be and others to see. It's\nbecause of that, I think made him very appealing to women; power,\ngentleness, and love behind the mystery. He wasn't there for evil, he\nwas there to stop it, to bring it down, with revenge and some serious\nskill. All of us women, need a little V in our lives.<br><br>10/10 ~ definite recommendation.\n"},

{"review": "\nI think V for Vendetta is a truly great film. It is one of the best\nfilms to be released in the last 2-3 years. The plot is different,\nmakes people think and provides good plot, characters and action. Altho\nbits from the comic, I feel, could have been introduced into the film.\nLike Dominics transformation to the new role of V leading the people of\nLondon. Perhaps they felt they should not corrupt the film with a\nsequel, I know that Alan Moore the original writer was unimpressed with\nthe film project and left, so perhaps it was in kindness to him. I\nthink it is ignorant to pick up the small things in the film that are\nperhaps wrong. I see people writing about how people in the UK never\nsay elevator, course they do, just because you don't say it. Hugo\nWeaving as the lead role does seem to suit him, his voice is superb,\nbut still it would be interesting to see how James Purefoys voice would\nhave sounded behind the mask.

There were\ncertainly some scenes inappropriate for children and yet there were\nalso scenes that need to be seen, images of things that might have\nhappened, could be happening and are likely to happen so long as the\npublic remains acquiescent. Although the movie preys on current fears\nand worst-case scenarios, it is well to remember that it is a\ncommentary on the potency of fear as a weapon of power, and not\nconfined to the specifics of contemporary environments.

{"review": "\nV for Vendetta had the makings of a typical Hollywood movie filled with\nexplosions, blood and violence. But the Wachowski brothers created a\nfilm with multiple levels of meaning that the trailers failed to even\nbegin decoding.

There are elements of\nHitler's rise to power through the induction of fear, the mystery of\nPhantom of the Opera, but most importantly an inquisitive protagonist\nsimilar to the one found in Orwell's 1984. The theme is evident: People\nshould not be afraid of their government; the government should be\nafraid of the people. Through ingenious acts of deception and illusion,\nthe main character, V, shapes Evie, a girl he rescues in an alleyway.\nAs a common woman, she represents all of society. She has the ability\nto incite change but is unsure how to go about it. V's acts come across\nas horrendous to some, but for those attentively listening to his\nrationale, seems so logical.

I'll admit to being somewhat of\na conspiracy theorist, and also admit to being rather mistrustful of\nour (US - G W H Bush) government. This movie though, should serve as a\nwarning to all that may chose to give up 'liberties' to gain some vague\n'security.' The totalitarian regime depicted in this movie isn't really\nall that far off from some that are currently in power in several\nso-called 'free' countries and we really must maintain vigilance that\nour leaders do not gain the powers that the leaders in this movie have\ngained.<br><br>I won't give anything away here, but I strongly urge ANYONE who is\nconcerned with civil liberties and free will to see this movie and to\nrecommend it to all their friends.<br><br>Writing this review a full five days after viewing, I still must give\nthis film a complete (and totally out of character for me) ten out of\nten, not for any acting, directing, or editing, but simply because I\nfeel that it conveys a very valuable message that ALL people who value\ntheir hard-earned freedoms should take heed. Our founding fathers would\nprobably love this movie, much as I did.<br><br>Enjoy!!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie is based on the fact that governments create fear in people\nto control them and spend billions on weapons and the military. See\n\"The Power of Nightmares\" by Adam Curtis for a documentary on this\ntopic.<br><br>The movie is not too far from reality when it depicts a dictator who\ndoes not care for his people and controls the media to spin his lies. A\nlot of oppressive regimes act this way around the world and in each of\nthese countries there are freedom fighters or terrorists depending on\nwhich side you are on.<br><br>The movie also communicates that the purpose of taking actions against\nthe oppressors is not just revenge but that each action is a strategy\nto make the oppressive regime collapse. Each of V's actions creates a\npre-calculated reaction which climaxes with the end sequence of the\nmovie.<br><br>Excellent work and truly emotional. The controversy will be that\nviolence was used by V to end the oppressive regime instead of the\nnon-violent ways of Gandhi and MLK.<br><br>Clearly the message of the movie could be taken one step further: The\nanalogy being the US committing state terror against other countries\nand that the oppressed people will fight back. The media control is\ncertainly well documented by Noam Chomsky in \"Manufacturing Consent\".\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is a punk film in every sense from the banned classical music to\nnatalie portmans haircut, punk originally set out to get itself\noutlawed yet ironically this film shows what the punks of 1976 could\nhave become had they become the law, maybe they are ? and it's too\nlate, a future banned classic maybe.Watch and listen between the\nlines..... Natalie portman is the complete actress with shades of Jodie\nfoster, Sigourney weaver and er, that girl out of Leon ? Cool. Equally\nadmirable is that this film has a true British quality to it that\nreminds us that although we are a small island we do tend to make a\nworld wide impact from time to time and not all of them regrettable. I\nsimply sat spellbound by this film wondering what old punks i knew had\nmade their way sufficiently enough in todays society to make all this\npossible, then i phoned a curry.<br><br>1984/10\n"},
{"review": "\nThis movie adaptation of the graphic novel is an astounding feast for\nthe eyes, thought food for your head and a emotive testament to the\npower of people in the face of adversity. The original 'comic' was set\nin a fictional version of neo-Nazi Thatcher era Britain, but taking out\nactual historical figures (apart from Guy Fawkes) gives the piece a\nmuch bigger net to cast. With enough fantastic fight scenes, and things\nblowing up to keep the action fans happy, V brings a multi-layered\ncomplexity, poetry and wit that one does not usually associate with\nthis kind of movie. Even though it is fiercely British (the dismissive\nand passing references to the civil war in \"the former United States\"\nis a powerful backdrop) one of the things that gives this movie such a\nresounding impact is the parallels that can be drawn to current world\nevents. If power corrupts, then absolute power corrupts absolutely. It\nlooks at how governments control the media, mutate and mold the publics\nperceptions and use questionable methods to their own ends. The tag\nline of 'People should not be afraid of their Governments, Governments\nshould be afraid of their people', is such a powerful and brave thing\nto say in this day and age when countries all over the world initiate\nsedition and treason laws. It's theatrical release was held back in the\nUK due to the London bombings and it's easy to understand why, but I'll\nspare you the spoilers. Their are some incredible performances, Natalie\nPortman as Evie gives perhaps the best performance of her career. John\nHurt's malevolent High Chancellor is a seething cauldron of hatred.\nStephen Fry as Gordon is magnificent and gives a glimpse of what I hope\nwill be more dramatic roles for him. And then there is V, played by\nHugo Weaving, who although you never see his face gives a remarkable\nportrayal full of humour, madness, righteous vengeance and tenderness.\nThat mask will forever evoke strong feeling in me. V FOR VENDETTA is an\nabsolute must see movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nI thought this was an amazing movie. It was very well put together and\nput out an amazing message about how media lies to sway peoples idea\nabout what goes on. Also it shows how people can come together to go\nagainst a totalitarian authority and defeat them without fear. This\nmovie reminded me a lot of the book \"1984\", the movie \"Wag the Dog\",\nand the movie \"Loose Change\" about 9/11. It showed how the chancellor\ntried to cover up what was really happening by feeding lies to the\npublic, which the publice did not buy. I recommend this movie to anyone\nlooking for a film that makes you think about our govt and if these\nkind of things really happen, we just don't know about it... Great\nmovie, one of my favorites.\n"},
{"review": "\nIn a near future, a totalitarian state is ruling England. On November,\n5th, a man self-calling V (Hugo Weaving) explodes a symbolic monument\nand starts fighting for freedom using terrorist technique. He also\nrescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from the claws of the abusive\nsecret police and later she becomes her allied. The man in charge of\nthe investigation, Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea), discloses the\ntruth about his leaders while chasing V.<br><br>\"V for Vendetta\" is in my opinion the best action movie of the year.\nThe story, about a totalitarian state that uses fear and terror to win\nthe elections and dominate the population, inclusive forging terrorist\nattacks, is much updated. There are many excellent lines in this\nOrwellian story, but I would like to highlight the following ones:\n\"People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should\nbe afraid of their people\"; and \"Ideas are bulletproof\". The awesome\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"1812 Overture\" fits amazingly perfect to\nboth scenes of explosion. \"V for Vendetta\" is not only a brilliant tale\nof revenge as the name suggests, but mostly a magnificent message and\nhymn of freedom. This is a movie that deserves to be watched many times\nas a lesson of freedom and citizenship. My vote is ten.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"V de Vingan\u00e7a\" (\"V for Vendetta\")\n"},
{"review": "\nV for Vendetta was an original movie that has substance. The comic book\nthat inspired this film has many deep seeded issues that I feel we all\ncan relate too. There was so much rich dialog that made you think, and\nthe action had you on the edge of your seat or at least mine\ndefinitely. Hugo Weaving did a great role choice to be V he also made\nthe character believable. I loved V for Vendetta in the theaters and\ncan not wait to own it at home. It was a well thought out film that has\nan edge and was very serious about what the world can become. I knew\nthat this movie was going to be good once I found out a little bit of\nbackground about it but I had no idea it was going to be as good as it\nwas. More movies should take the approach of V for Vendetta because it\nhad great screen shots, once again dialog, and a unique story line. V\nfor Vendetta is a movie you will want to watch over and over and over\nagain. Once you see this film it will be hard to talk about anything\nelse but V for Vendetta.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is one of my favorite movies ever. The story stars with Evey, a\nwoman who is trying to visit her boss. When she is attacked by the\npolice, a mysterious figure, V, helps her. When he meets her, he makes\na speech using much alliteration with the letter V, ending with, \"You\ncan call me V.\" I think that is a very nice touch. The movie doesn't\nstrongly follow the comic book, but this is not a disappointment. In\nthe comic, each victim is killed in a symbolic way, but in the movie,\nthey all get a lethal injection from V. When V is ready to execute his\nplan, he takes over the TV studio, and puts a mask on every person,\nsimilar to \"Inside Man\" This movie is highly recommended.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis film is one of probably the best of its kind after the classic\n1984. Similarities are many to the original 1984 (as in all\ntotalitarian regimes) and the presentation of things is both amazing\nand intense. Acting is brilliant by all of the actors and the\nappearance of some action scenes does not spoil the film at all. The\nmost wonderful about this film is the fact that it presents imaginary\nfacts with a tremendous resemblance to todays \"war on terrorism\". In\nthe end terrorists are which ones ? Even all the citizens of your own\ncountry ? Words like freedom and safety sometimes get on the opposite\nsides of the road. There are big similarities (at least in behavior)\nbetween the Prime Minister of the film and other totalitarian leaders.\nAnyway ... what an amazing film !!!\n"},
{"review": "\nThe film \"V for Vendetta\" is based upon the same-titled comic book\nwritten referring to a real-life event: the assassination of one of the\nmost honorable English protesters of his time Guy Fawkes, who\nsacrificed his life in the name of peace and human dignity. Remembering\nthe persecution of the Church during the English assent to it's new\nliberalism with the manifestation of Parlement and to the excesses of\nThrone at the time. <br><br>A very political film since it demands the audience place themselves\nnot in the Edward Gibbon (\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\")\nSenatorial mindset but one of the world - and in this case the\nfuturistic English society - drone Babbits in the guise of Natalie\nPortman's character.<br><br>In a time when political discussion is forbidden in the workplace, in\nreligion (outside rubber stamping each and every authority), in\nentertainment (again outside bitchy comments on SNL or Comedy\nCentral)it was probably too much to hope the general public would - or\neven could - assimilate this motion picture.<br><br>Each segment has a reference to today's political, economic and social\nhierarchy - and would in a fair world would be picked apart by high\nschool teachers like they do other populist entertainment. <br><br>But it is not useful to any cause that is currently embraced by the\nsocial order so that's not likely. -- We'll have to wait until there is\nyet another challenge to the status quo in twenty years for the film to\nsuddenly be discovered for use as a battering ram against \"convention\"\nas was done in 1960s with \"King of Hearts\" and later with \"One Flew\nOver The Cuckoos Nest\".<br><br>But I'm patient - in time it will be enthroned as a poster child for\nanother generation that it missed in ours.\n"},

{"review": "\nV For Vendetta is a stunning adaptation of Alan Moore's science-fiction\ngraphic novel that is faithful to its ideals, albeit with some updates\nwhich make it seem more relevant to today's world.
