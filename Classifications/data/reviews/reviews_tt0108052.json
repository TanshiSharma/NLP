{"review": "\nI know many of you, out there will disagree with me, when I say that\nSchindler's List is one of the greatest film that there has ever been.\nIt does sound that I'm extremely overrating it, but I truly believe\nthat Schindler's List is up there with The Godfather and Citizen Kane I\nmean everything about is so good, that its close to perfection.<br><br>The acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. Liam Neeson\nas Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an\nOscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best\nactor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well\nthat it is a travesty, he didn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting\nActor.<br><br>I'm happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it\nwas one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film\nwasn't considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don't know which film\nwould be, expect maybe for The Godfather.<br><br>Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was\na smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black-white\nbecause it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you\nsee small patches of color -- A candle and a child's coat bringing the\nevilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus.<br><br>There's no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even\nhundreds of years to come in cinema. This film is without a doubt, the\nBest film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven\nSpielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost\nArk, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven\nSpielberg's most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the\ntragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece.<br><br>10/10 Absolutely Recommended!\n"},

This movie is more than just something for us to\nwatch for 3 hours and 17 minutes, it is something for us to never forget,\nto\nteach us a lesson and to remember those who died needlessly along with\nthose\nwho tried to help those same people survive. \n"},
{"review": "\n\nSchindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of\nthe greatest films ever made in the world.<br><br>The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited\noff of slave labor.  The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler.\nOskar is just like most men.  He has a love for good wine, beautiful\nwomen,\nand pursues happiness through the success of his business.  But on his\njourney to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed\nduring\na time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history.\nAs\nOskar made money, innocent people were being murdered.  That's when the\nself-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of\nhaving a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000\nJews.<br><br>This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black\nand\nwhite by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer).  At the helm is no one other\nthan Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and\nbrought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't.\nThis film is a must see by me.  I give the film an \"A+\" (wishing I could\ngive it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10...\n\n"},

It\ndepicts the horrors of the Holocaust and war, the tragedy of Jewish nation,\nand I know, this film could be directed by a Jew, who keeps these horrible\ntimes and crimes against humanity in his heart. The tagline says \"Whoever\nsaves one life, saves the world entire\". And this film shows us that no\nhuman life can be replaced by another one, and that there is nothing more\nvaluable than HUMAN LIFE. I have not seen a film of such a power in my life.\nSuperbly directed by Steven Spielberg, magnificently photographed in\nblack-and-white by Janusz Kaminski (one of the best directors of photography\nin modern Hollywood, so to say), perfect performances by Liam Neeson and Ben\nKingsley, and, especially, John Williams' beautiful, brilliant score, brings\nthe whole horror and tragedy, cruelty of Nazism, Holocaust and War. This is\nSpielberg's Triumph. Congratulations!\n"},

{"review": "\n\nTo sum up Spielberg's masterwork in one word is a nearly impossible task,\nbut I have come to the conclusion that Schindler's List is perfect. Liam\nNeeson as Oskar Schindler is truly great in recreating the role of a\nmodern\nday Moses. Making this film all the more compelling is John Williams'\nperfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the\nawards\nbestowed upon it, especially best picture by the National Board of Review\nand the Academy and the Academy Award for best director Steven Spielberg.\nIt\ndeserves all these awards and more.

{"review": "\nWhen I first saw that Spielberg was behind the movie, I had my doubts\nsince his earlier work doesn't really fall into this category, but I\nheld faith and I have not been disappointed! From the beginning it is\nsuch a powerful and moving film and it brought tears to my eyes more\nthen once. It is completely set in Black &amp; White, except for the Red\nCoat Girl which is pure genius, since it really helps develop the time\nperiod it was portrayed in.<br><br>The Actors too were completely fantastic! Every single actor and extra\nseemed to be doing their very best and really lived their roles,\nespecially Ralph Fiennes, who was brilliant as the twisted Nazi Amon\nGoeth. Not just anyone could make that character real and get away with\nit. All of the characters in the film have depth and substance and the\nbest thing was that you actually see a few of the Jewish people\nthroughout the entire film so we can sympathize with their tale more.<br><br>It's a film to watch if you enjoy depth and meaning. 9 Stars, Excellent\nFilm!\n"},
{"review": "\n\n\" I....pardon you.\"<br><br>These words spoken by Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes) during the film can be\naptly used to signify the themes of this film: power and\nforgiveness.<br><br>I am part of the post war generation who has been lucky enough not to\nexperience any major war. And after watching this film, I have deep respect\nand feelings for those who suffered during these times, be it the Holocaust\nor the Nam war. This film was just waiting to be made and I'm glad it was\nthe right man who dared to take up the challenge. Any other person would\nnot\nhave done it justice.<br><br>The film focuses on how a German named Oskar Schindler saved the lives of\nthousands of Jews by employing them to work in his factory during WWII.\nHowever, I feel the film's primary aim is not to show us Schindler's\nkindness but the horrors of war. There are some of the most true and\ngraphic\nscenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular\nreason, hiding in fear, stripped and gased, abused......so much so that\nviewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never\ngot to see this \"flip side\" of the war in many Hollywood productions which\nonly focuses on action and their unrealistic \"gung-ho\" heroes. ( Another\nexcellent film would be \"Saving Pte Ryan\" by Spielberg again ) War and its\nhorrors are finally and faithfully recreated for the audience.<br><br>Like the film Raging Bull, its shot beautifully in black and white to\nreflect the era and tone of the film. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are\nexcellent, esp the latter for his frightening protrayal of Amon Goethe. The\nscene where they discuss about power is a classic and the subsequent one\nwhere Amon 'pardons' a young jew remains as one of my many\nfavs!<br><br>\n"},
{"review": "\nThe most amazing thing about this film is that it was not made to be an\nepic or an acclaimed film. Spielberg made it as a personal film for\nhimself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing\nflashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance.\nSpielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and\nediting, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of\nthe film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive,\ninvolving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of\nhistory that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best\never written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors\nbut without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and\nwhite photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a\nperfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant,\nwith Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes\nbringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben\nKingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The\nfilm also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and\nspiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied\nto any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of\nthe the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years\nto come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are\napplicable in any age.\n"},

I next expect a new\nPollyanna by Spielberg any day now. The problem with Spielberg's\ncharacterizations is that people are either black or white, no inbetweens\nare allowed. But even  old Adolph can be presented in a way that makes him\nthe human being that he was, regardless. This is what makes Shakespeare such\na genius in his plays - he never failed to see all sides of a personality.\nSpielberg's characterizations are cartoons.\nThis could have been a really good movie, if it had acknowledged the<br><br>humanity in every person and been realistic. \n"},

{"review": "\n\nFirst I have to say that being born in Poland, I knew about holocaust since\nbefore I was 10. I guess only in Israel people are more aware of it.

On the other\nhand criticizing the movie for it's factual faults is even more slippery\nnontheless. The movie itself is very good indeed, with great acting,\nmemorable scenes, and overall very impressive. I remember that when the end\ncredits started rolling people in the theater were very quiet, and didn't\nmove. Many were shocked by the realism of this movie. It surely is one of\nthe greatest movies ever, but Steven Spielberg intended it to be much more\nthan just a movie. This is where I stop admiring his work.<br><br>Many will take this film's version of history as a fact. I'm talking about\nthe way Poles were shown in SL. Mr. Spielberg presents us as hateful\nantisemitic creatures, and he does it so convincingly that if I didn't know\nany better I would surely believe it. The second issue is the gas chamber\nscene - in reality, none of the people who would enter the so called \"shower\nroom\" would survive. And as for Oskar Schindler - he didn't consider himself\nas a man on the mission, not concerned about his profits at all.

{"review": "\nI am probably still too young to understand the real reasons why SL is\nhailed as one of the greatest films ever made. It was mostly shot in\nblack and white while virtually all other movies in the decades before\nand since are in colour, adding even more of a sense of realism to the\nfilm. Schindler's List is a story of a man's change of heart and\nattitude alongside themes of survival, hope, brutality (mostly served\nby Ralph Fiennes' murderous Amon Goth)and countless other situations\nfor hundreds of Jews. In black and white, the bloody, graphic summary\nexecutions of Jews throughout the film were overwhelming, the images\nfreezing me in my seat and imprinting themselves in my mind to this\nday, but they justifiably implied to you the horrors of the Holocaust\nlike no other movie. The girl in the red coat seems to symbolise, as\nher fate suggests, that there is no escape from the dominant force. The\nacting is spotless. Liam Neeson should have won an Oscar for portraying\nSchindler (I must admit, I am yet to see Tom Hanks in Philadelphia)\nwith an emotional tone, the performance launching him into\nsuper-stardom once and for all. Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes also\nplayed their parts with the right touch, especially Fiennes whose\ncharacter also seems to change within, halfway through the film, but\nonly slightly, his insanity still alive as in one scene he randomly\nsnipes numerous Jewish workers from his bedroom. But the star is\ndirector Steven Spielberg, who in 1993 made maybe not his most famous\nmovie, other projects such as E.T., Saving Private Ryan, CEOTTK, the\nIndiana Jones saga also rising forward.

{"review": "\nThe Holocaust during World War II forms the backbone of the plot in\nthis highly-acclaimed, heart-touching movie.

But, soon\nenough, his greed is subdued by his attachment to them and he plans to\nsave them from Hitler's persecution, even if he has to throw away his\nhard-earned savings as bribes to the Nazi officers. A very commendable\njob by the writers makes the character come alive very convincingly.\nLiam Neeson cannot be given any less credit for portraying the\nprotagonist and Ben Kingsley as Stern adds a cherry to the cake. But,\nthe portrayal of the setup actually used by Nazis to slaughter the\nJews, makes the audience shiver with fear and disbelief. The detailing\nand hard-work put by Spielberg is quite evident in the scene where the\nJewish children try to elude the Nazi soldiers by hiding in places\ninconceivable to any ordinary man. Another such instance is when the\nJews are transported in trains, huddled like cattle without enough\nspace to take even a whiff of air. <br><br>An unbiased judge may opine that there were quite a few instances where\nthe protagonist may have been idealized in order to make the people\nreally adore him. This can be defended by accepting that the real Oskar\nSchindler acted only as a source of inspiration for the role, and the\nrest had to be cooked up as per the appetite of the audience.

Schindler saw the Jews as people and as his\npeers, to all the others they were an inferior life form, to be\nexterminated.<br><br>The movie was mainly shot in black and white, conveying a mood of\nbleakness and hopelessness. The most memorable use of color is the red\ncoat worn by a little girl, seen by Schindler during the evacuation to\nthe camps and again seen by him in a pile of burning corpses.<br><br>The main characters were developed in depth and detail. Schindler's\ncharacter changed from a greedy businessman to someone who spent all\nhis money bribing the 'list makers' to save as many Jews as possible.\nThe mood intensifies as the Jews realizes that they are being\nsystematically killed, and, that the Nazis are slowly loosing their\ngrasp on their humanity as they indiscriminately kill all the\nprisoners. In the end, the audience are reminded that although\nunbelievable, these events are real and that real people are depicted\nin the movie.\n"},
{"review": "\nSchindler's list gave me some insight on how Jews were treated out of\nconcentration camps in Nazi Germany. This film is about Oskar\nSchindler, a German businessman who starts a company making silverware\nusing unpaid Jewish labor during the Nazi regime. Overtime as Schindler\ndevelops empathy towards his workers. Schindler moves his factory and\nhis workers back to his hometown in Czechoslovakia and waits till the\nwar blows over. During the process of aiding the Jewish people,\nSchindler spent millions of Reich marks in order to feed and save 1100\nJews. This movie The Nazi soldiers would abuse Jews by cutting their\nhair, push them around, or even killing them. Jews were forced to wear\na Star of David and were obliged by law to inform German men that they\nare Jewish. This film shows us how Jews were forced to change their\nusual practices in daily life. This is depicted in the scene where\nSchindler tells the Rabbi that he should be preparing for the Sabbath\nsince it is Friday evening. This is also seen when the Jews are\ncelebrating and they break the glass. Overall I believe that this was a\nfantastic film that was very educational about the Holocaust and the\nJewish faith, and also an inspiring humanitarian.\n"},
{"review": "\nSteven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really\nlike from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into\nthe concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them\nfrom the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who\ngives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for\nthe German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real\nlife. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not\nonly capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost\nArk, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close\nEncounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but\nwhat he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his\nmovie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into\ntheaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam\nNeeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph\nFiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no\nmercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting\npersecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named\nItzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names\nof the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable\nmovie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a\nmasterpiece Spielberg has created.\n"},

(Wiki) Three hours long black &amp; white\nmovie is remarkable in itself.

I was completely surprised when read on\nend credits that it's direct by Steven Spielberg. The director who\nmostly directs big fantasy movies from years.

{"review": "\nThis movie is about ordinary people showing the best of humanity or\nunfortunately the worse. As my favorite writer, PKD, said holocaust\nwasn't only Hitler and his pals but began foremost with those thousands\nof anonymous Germans, Polish, Ukrainians, French that operated the\ncamps, the trains, opened the doors and close them, brought the lethal\ngas and so on. Everyone would contribute even small in the process was\nas guilty as their original planners. Shoah is about individual morals\nand value and it was up to every one to choose the path to be a killer\nor a righteous. The movie is brilliant for that because you see that\nthousands of anonymous killers and one brave soul who repents. Sure,\nit's greed that leads Oskar to those families but it's their suffering\nthat makes him change. From that point of view, i don't think that the\ngirl who wore red is an error as other people think because she\nsymbolizes his borderline. From this moment, Oskar is touched and is on\nduty: Liam becomes really irresistible of empathy and courage. Next,\nsome french media consider a bigger flaw that the women's convoy is\nonly lead to shower and not death chambers. Well, that's the proof that\nthey haven't understood Spielberg's sensibility: he doesn't direct a\ndocumentary but as always, a movie about hope, about this little flame\nthat still burns in the darkest hours. So he didn't have to show those\nwoman dying as well as he could mix a lot of atrocities that surely\nhasn't all happened in the real Schindler's story but happens really\nduring the war: killing disabled, killing for fun, etc... In that way,\nFiennes and Liam delivers unforgettable performances, the one as an\nunforgettable pit of darkness and the other as a force of life.

{"review": "\nThis amazing story is, in my humble opinion, the epitome of Spielberg's\nwork. To bring a story like this to the screen is nothing short of\nmagnificent. It would be difficult to single out a particular actor for\ntheir contributions, since the film is so cohesive and unified. You are\nimmediately drawn into the action, you are watching the events unfold\nas if you were there. Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler is dynamic\nand compelling. At first he appears the opportunist and war profiteer,\nbut his growth through the film lets you feel his compassion. Ben\nKingsley's quiet and steady demeanor throughout the film compliments\nNeeson's. Ralph Fiennes is the quintessential Nazi camp commandant,\nunhappy to be where he is, ruthless in his orders, and totally without\ncompassion. He is a soulless man who cannot feel love or hate, simply\ndisdain for the Jews, as if they were cattle. There are so many scenes\nin this film that speak to your soul, but perhaps the most important\nline in the film occurs near the end. \"If you save one life, in time\nyou save the world.\" The violence and cruelty of the film make it\nunsuitable for those under 14, and between 14 and 17, I would use sound\njudgment.

{"review": "\nSome films i feel you can watch and just think there is something wrong\nand you don't really feel anything from it.

Schindlers list is\none of those films like a lot of other Spielberg greats (Saving Private\nRyan,Jaws)really grips you.This is probably the most powerful epic of\nany historical event ever made. Everything about it is perfection for a\ngood movie. From the incredible performances by Liam Neeson as Oskar\nwho i felt had deserved an academy award more than any actor alive for\nhis performance and also for Ralph Feinnes as a terrifying Nazi and Ben\nKingsleyalso gives another memorable performance as Jewish factory\nworker Izthak Stern right to the dazzling cinematography (the film was\nshot in an amazing black and white style to give it a more historical\nand realistic look). I think my favourite scene of the film has to be\nat the beginning when you see the all the Jews being evacuated and\nterrorised by German soldiers and then suddenly a little girl appears\nin a red dress which is the only coloured part of the film. That to me\nis shot that will go down in movie history.Many people believe that\nSpielberg is the kind of guy who is always going to be remembered for\nmasterpieces like E.T,Jaws and the Indy trilogy. In my opinion this is\nthe film where we knew that Spielberg was right next to Martin Scorsese\nand Spike Lee was one of todays greatest living directors.\n"},

Most of us agree that the worst\nthing to do about something like the Holocaust is to forget it, lest it\nhappen again.

But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews\nwere being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest\nperiods of human history.

{"review": "\nKubrick said that the holocaust was about six million who died,\nSchindler's List was about six thousand who didn't. That perfectly\nencapsulates the brilliance of this film. The Holocaust was the most\nhorrific event man ever caused, nothing comes close. Somehow, Spielberg\nfound a story of hope in the pitch black evil. That is not to say this\nmovie is for the faint of heart. Nothing about Schindler's List is\neasy, it will break you but in the end the tears you shed--and you will\ncry--are not elicited by horror but by beauty. It is the story of a\nman, by no means a saint, who finds it in himself to stand up against\nthe horrors of his day. I could write on about the acting, writing or\ndirecting, and it is all superb, but to do so would miss the point.\nSchindler's List excels because it has the all important fourth factor,\nthe right stuff. I am too young to have seen it in theaters and I envy\nthose who shared this experiences with strangers, but every time I\nwatch this film I am left speechless. I do feel the need to right about\nthe ending. Realizing that the evil presented in this film is of a\ndegree we cannot fathom, Spielberg brilliantly reconnected us to\nreality. It was on my third viewing when it occurred to me that the\nlittle boy, the grandson of a Schindler Jew, was no more then eight\nyears old. This would mean that he was born after Schindler died yet\nowes his entire existence to the man. This is the beautiful part of the\nstory, this is what brings me to tears every damn time. Schindler's\ninfluence stretches beyond the grave. This movie was over twenty years\nago, that boy is now a man, probably married, maybe with children.\nSchindler gave the girl a husband, the boy a father, and they never\nshared time on earth. This is one of the twentieth centuries most\nextraordinary films about one of its most extraordinary men and if it\nwasn't for the film, we wouldn't even know the name Oskar Schindler.\n"},

Not to mention that the whole concept of the film\nonly came to realize when Ralph Fiennes force you to comprehend the\nabstract meaning of humanitarianism.Apart from the actors and their\nglorious plays the storyline was sad and drama but worth even ten\nvisits.When a conceited businessman gradually changes during his war\nlife and decide to help his workers to survive you can feel the true\nstory that lies behind the movie. Thus if you have not seen the film\nyet I strongly recommend watching it as soon as possible.\n"},
{"review": "\nI watched this film and instantly was fixed it is an extremely sesertiv \r\nfilm played so well by its cast eye opening for all to see a glimpse of \r\nwhat was going on in the death camps and our world war 2 battle agains \r\nevil Hitler and a beautiful story of a man trying to save he's fellow \r\nman and women from death every life saved was not enough it's hard to \r\ngrasp some parts but very captivating and yet so upsetting to remember \r\nall the treacherous deaths of so many innocent people sent to the gas \r\nchambers and Schindler was buying the Jews to save them from death it's \r\na must watch film and lovely in some way even tho there is so much \r\nupset it's a balance just rite it's not easily forgotten but much \r\nneeded as this is real in life this should be a good film for lots to \r\nlearn\r\n\n"},
{"review": "\nI watched Schindler's list for three reasons: 1) It is one of THE best\nmovies of the past half a century 2) The theme song is amazing. 3) Come\non!! Its a Steven Spielberg movie As a violinist, I have always loved\nthe theme song and the sad melancholic melody, so it was only fitting\nto watch the movie to try and bring more life to the music when I\nplayed it. And it worked.Schindler's list is an amazing movie, If you\nhaven't watched it, you really need to. Steven Spielberg is a genius\nand having only the little girl in color somehow added a even greater\ndepth of sadness and melancholy to the movie. I admit, I did cry a lot\nduring the film.\n"},
{"review": "\n\"Schindler's List\" tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a nazi at WWII\nthat decides to save jews from a concentration camp. At first, he did\nnot intend to save them, he was only interested in money, to buy jews\nto work in his factory, and make him money. But lately, we see Oskar\nchange his mind, and secretly, saving the most people as he can. It\nwouldn't be bad if Martin Scorsese had accepted the offer to direct\nthis feature, but Steven Spielberg shows the story in a magnificent\ndirecting, cinematography, screenplay, score and performances. With 7\nAcademy Awards, \"Schindler's List\" is considered a classic of movies\nand keeps touching all kind of people's heart.\n"},
{"review": "\nProbably one of the best film ever made. Of course it's Steven\nSpielberg, but considering the actors portraying their characters most\nespecially Liam Neeson as Oskar Shindler, he performed it excellently.\nThe plot which happened in 1939 which started the World War II showed\ninformation to those who are not well versed with what really happened\nat that time.<br><br>As a 1980's baby, I never knew what life was with the Jews until I\nwatched this film. It is more than an entertainment film for me. It is\nvery informative and adds knowledge to the naive. <br><br>And I was very impress with the casting. the fact that Neeson\nauditioned for the film while we all know he's a good actor then and\nnow.<br><br>Cinematography, wow I like the idea of Spielberg of making it\ndocumentary-like kind of film. He used black and white to make it feel\nlike real documentary from the 1930's. It surely gave an edge of the\nfilm. Spielberg is a genius.<br><br>Overall, I love it.\n"},
{"review": "\nOskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic\nwomanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets\naccess to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley)\nas his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He\nprovides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous\nconnections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to\nsave people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp\nunder the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is\nable to befriend the mad commander.<br><br>This is probably the most important movie of director Steven\nSpielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on\nthe true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create\nthis iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and\nthankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam\nNeeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a\ncomplex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of\nthe Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I\ncouldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end.\n"},
{"review": "\nVisually, this film is fantastic. It is very well directed, and easily\ndeserved the acclaim for its cinematography and its direction. However,\nbeyond that, there is really nothing spectacular. <br><br>If I'm being honest, this film felt kind of desperate to me. I watched\nit feeling as if I was watching a film designed to win Oscars and to\ncash in on a tragic event like this, and I think the fact that it's in\nEnglish as opposed to Polish and German (which would be more authentic)\nprove this. Spielberg has made a very commercial film, and I feel like\nit loses a lot of its power due to this. I feel like The Pianist, by\ncontrast, is more real, it feels very raw and fresh, whereas this\nalmost felt gimmicky. I felt like it was trying too hard, and got lost.<br><br>Finally, Liam Neeson really ruined this film. His acting was laughable,\nit was actually embarrassing seeing him fluctuate between an Irish and\n'German' accent. Ralph Fiennes was great as always, but Neeson was a\njoke.<br><br>This is a pretty good film, it's not bad, but it's certainly not worthy\nof a place in the top 100, let alone top 10.\n"},
{"review": "\nFantastic movie. Epic drama about determination, courage and more.\nMaybe Steven Spielberg's very best films (subjectively) Spielberg has\nmanaged to create a film that will reverberate far into the future\ngenerations.<br><br>It is so nice, beautiful and sad true to totally goes with it.<br><br>It contains some of the most powerful scenes I've seen, with\nmasterfully beautiful spectacle that is rarely seen better.<br><br>This film is a masterpiece and my favorite movies. the film will be\nshown in black and white, only a few places are colors. the black and\nwhite give the film the last thing to the tragic events. masterpiece.\n"},
{"review": "\nThis is pretty much Steven Spielberg's cinematic coming of age. It hits\nevery element perfectly and it's a masterpiece. The movie is not afraid\nto be highly brutal and it does an amazing job showing us the ugliness\nof the concentration camps. All movies of this genre should not be\nafraid to have this element of brutality and Schindler's List does it\nperfectly. It does a great job making us care for Schindler and I can\ntell that Spielberg really cared for him and his actions. It's a very\npowerful film and the fact that this was based on a true story only\nstrengthens the emotional power. The fact that it was shot in black and\nwhite undoubtedly gives it more power and emotion. Saying this movie\nwas expertly shot would be an understatement. I've never seen a film\nshot better then this. This is a one of a kind film and we may never\nsee it duplicated. It hits all the elements perfectly and succeeds in\nevery way. This is one of the best movies of all time and it must be\nwatched.\n"},
{"review": "\nI thought this movie was going to be slow and boring... instead I ended\nup giving it a 10 hands down! This movie had tons of emotion and each\ncharacter did a phenomenal job. I would say it was a tad slow in the\nbeginning but it's the only way they were able to create the story\nbuild up so I looked past that. No movie has ever really grabbed my\nheart like this one. The way it was produced allows you to grow with\nthe characters and feel what they feel. I was also shocked when Liam\nNeeson was in this! I thought this was a really old movie and was\npositive it was a look-a-like or a relative but I was wrong! He is one\nof my favorite actors so it made the movie THAT much better. Overall a\nclassic, excellent movie and a MUST SEE!!!\n"},
{"review": "\nMASTERPIECE. By far, my favorite Holocaust movie so far. It depicts the\nhorrors of the war and the Jewish nation's suffering and tragedy. It\nperfectly shows that there is nothing more valuable than human life,\npowerful and touching. Spielberg directed this movie superbly, and the\nwork done by Janusz Kaminsky (director of photography) was magnificent.\nI must admit that I don't always pay attention to these details, but\nwhat was done in Schindler's List, captures your attention and is hard\nto ignore any detail. The performances are also pretty amazing, Liam\nNeeson's Oskar Schindler is perfectly interpreted. Every expression\nbuilds a man, who starts as an ambitious business owner, and\neventually, turns into a compassionate man. Yet, my favorite\nperformance was Ralph Fiennes as the cruel Nazi officer, Amon Goeth;\ntwisted, cruel and believable. He creates a perfect villain. Great\nmovie, shocking and heart-shifting.\n"},
{"review": "\nBased on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam\nNeeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an\nopportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a\ncompany to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win\nmilitary contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern\n(Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews\nwho've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a\ndependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant\ncould mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for\nSchindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the\nPlaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph\nFiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners\nfrom his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in\nhis plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he\nbegins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now\nrefitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his\nstaff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands\nmore workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his\nemployee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the\nallies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people\nfrom likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards\nand won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director\nfor Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest\nAmerican movies about the Holocaust.\n"},
{"review": "\nGreetings from Lithuania.<br><br>To call \"Schindler's List\" a great movie would be a huge\nunderestimating. This is simply one of the best motion pictures of all\ntime.

No matter what are your believes, not matter what is\nyour life experience or anything else - this is a monumental movie\nexperience. Probably no other movie in my life grabbed my so hard,\ndelivered me to the place and made me experience events so purely as\n\"Schindler's List\" did. <br><br>This is a movie making at it's very best. Everything in this movie\nworks on highest level for some simple reasons - to get the knowledge\nand to learn. Learn from our past, learn from our unforgivable mistakes\nand to witness a descent humanity in the most ruthless places of our\ntimes. <br><br>I won't going to start to admire this movie craftsmanship. It's\nbrilliant. Everything here combines to a one excruciating masterpiece.\nOne who will experience \"Schindler's List\" won't going to ever forget\nit. This is a timeless masterpiece. And one of the most sticking things\nthat ever haunted me was that this picture was created in Hollywoood,\nby Steven Spielberg who at the time was mostly known for mainstream\nblockbuster experiences. How could they come up with such an idea and\nmost important how could they created this kind of a movie, which\ndoesn't represent popular teams and tones is still beyond me. I guess,\ntrue art find it's way, and for this motion picture Steven Spielberg\nwill be remembered forever.<br><br>Overall, if you haven't experienced \"Schindler's List\" by now, do your\nself a favor and witness this masterpiece ASAP. I'm writing this review\nfrom a country which is neighboring country to Poland. I'm so grateful\nto a simple luck that i wasn't born and wasn't there when these\nunthinkable events have happened.

{"review": "\nSchindler's List is the most significant and the most touching movie I\nsaw. We recall the hell of war ...

It is true that\nthese events are really remarkable, the sensitive souls will have a\nhard time cashing them. Moreover it is not colorized version, it is\nabsolutely plunged in the heart of the story.

{"review": "\nWhen I was in grade 10 we gad to watch this in English class. I heard\nthe name and thought it was going to be lame, I was wrong. Even though\nthis movie is black and white it has character and heart. This movie is\nby far one of my favourite movies ever! It made me realize even though\nall the hate and suffering in the world there are good people who will\ndo good things, the movie does not go away from the bad that happened,\nit wants you to know how bad it was for Jewish people. This is based on\na real man back in WWII and I one day want to see his grave and pay my\nrespects to an incredible man. If you have not seen this movie I would\nhighly recommend it to anyone!\n"},
{"review": "\nThis would be one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I never get\ntired of it. It's such a sad story but the movie has paid so much\nrespect to it, which is extremely well done. I also love how the movie\nis in black and white except for the little girl in the red dress - it\nfeels like she signals hope and when he finds her in the human pile, it\nseems like all hope is lost - which we see it of course isn't. Although\nthere's so many great actresses in this movie, Liam Neeson truly steals\nthe spotlight with one of his best performances of all time! It's\namazing how he had the ability to play such different role in 1\ncharacter and still have empathy in such hard times.

Quite simply, this is a\nmasterpiece that rivals the likes of Beethoven and Shakespeare, if you\nhaven't seen this movie you have yet to experience a piece of the\ngenius humankind are capable of.

{"review": "\nSchindler's list showed the Jews would rather die than abandon their\nfaith in God. This is shown when they are forced to leave their homes\nin the beginning of the movie, only allowed to take what they can\ncarry, and leave all other belongings. Some men are seen praying or\nholding prayer beads. As they are gathered on the street, there is many\nanti-Jewish graffiti seen on the walls and windows of shops and so on.\nThey are then moved to the Ghetto, where they are forced to work and\nkept inside the community. They still prayed to God that things would\nbe just again, and still retained faith. When out of no where, the Nazi\nauthority gathers people on the streets and shoots them if they don't\nget on a train to a labor camp. Many are seen paying respects to a\nsmall shrine in their homes, or praying. Even when they are put in a\nlabor camp, an old lady performs the rituals of a Bar Mitzvah for a\nboy. Then they leave the labor camp for Schindler's factory, which is\nwhere there is peace for them. <br><br>Through all these hardships, the Jews that survived still held on to\nthese traditions and belief in God, and those who didn't survive died\nwith their beliefs.\n"},
{"review": "\nThoughtful, perfectly executed and respectful to the subject matter.\nSpielberg is directing from the heart here and delivers his most\naccomplished film. Schindlers List is punctuated by exceptional\nperformances all round from an ensemble cast including career best\nperformances from Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes. The latter is on\nparticularly fine form as the unremittingly evil Camp Commandant Amon\nGoeth. A powerfully important film - Spielberg's camera never flinches\naway from the horrors unfolding in front of our eyes. But it is never\ngratuitous. Polish Director of Photography Janusz Kaminski delivers\nbeautiful and haunting black and white visuals which will stay with you\nlong after the film is over.<br><br>10/10\n"},
{"review": "\nI first saw this movie in school for my trip to Auschwitz. The movie\nshowed the Holocaust really realistic. The black and white touch gives\nit a some kind of historical flair, which I really like and it goes\nwell with the movie. This is the story of Oskar Schindler who kept over\n1,000 people alive during the Nazi reign. Liam Neeson is phenomenal in\nhis role as Schindler. What I like it the faded splash of faint color\nin the little girls red coat; the rest of the movie is black and white,\nwhich only adds to the impact of the total emotion of this fantastic\nfilm. Schindlers List is such an emotionally shattering and gripping\nmovie that no words can even describe it.\n"}
